100	immigrant	The user seeks an overview of research on immigrants’ integration and impacts in host societies. Specifically, they want evidence on how immigration policy frameworks and the composition of inflows shape native attitudes, labor market outcomes, welfare/crime perceptions, and political behavior across countries, and what policies best support integration.	A document is relevant if it substantively focuses on immigrants as people residing in a receiving country—covering their experiences, integration, labor-market outcomes, health, legal treatment, political participation, or public attitudes/policy toward immigration (e.g., studies of EU8 immigrants in Germany, second-generation outcomes, or analyses of integrative vs restrictive policies). Morphological and related terms count when clearly about the same concept, such as immigration, immigrant-origin, first/second generation, or comparisons of refugees/economic migrants that speak to immigrant reception and impact. It is weakly or non-relevant if “immigrant” appears only in passing (titles, footnotes, metadata), is used metaphorically or in unrelated domains (e.g., “Immigrant Song,” animal “immigrants” in ecology), or discusses emigration/internal migration without linking to immigrants in a host society. Edge cases include country-specific policy evaluations, legal analyses of enforcement and criminalization, or media-framing studies—all relevant if immigrants are the core subject; by contrast, broad labor or cultural studies that do not distinguish immigrant status, or datasets where “immigrant” is incidental, are not. Even documents taking negative or positive stances, historical chapter outlines, or cross-national attitude surveys are relevant when immigrants are central to the research question.
10109	politik	The query seeks scholarly overviews of “politics” that explain political decision-making and governance (e.g., public choice, principal–agent), the symbolic and media-mediated dimensions of politics, and how gender, ideology, and institutions shape political behavior. It also looks for applications such as protest as alternative politics, policy advice and evidence-based policymaking, refugee policy, and youth engagement.	For the query “politik,” a document is relevant if it substantively treats politics in the German sense—political processes, institutions, actors, or policies—and uses terms like Politik, politisch, Politiker, or compounds such as Politikberatung or Flüchtlingspolitik in meaningful context. Examples of clearly relevant content include analyses of principal–agent problems in representative democracy, studies of politicians’ emotional expressivity in media, discussions of symbolic politics and politainment, policy advice and evidence-based policymaking, protest as alternative politics, political economy, or systems-theory views of political steering. A document is non-relevant if “Politik” appears only tangentially (e.g., as a throwaway line, in metadata, or as “Firmenpolitik” in a purely corporate/organizational sense) or if the focus is on unrelated domains like sport or culture without analytical linkage to political phenomena. Edge cases such as philosophical treatments (utopia/biopolitics), media–politics intersections, or football–politics overlaps are relevant when they analyze political power, communication, or decision-making, but purely metaphorical or linguistic uses without public/political substance are not. Morphological variants and topical compounds count toward relevance, whereas accidental substring matches or proper names without political analysis do not.
10418	politic	The user seeks research on what drives political participation and engagement, focusing on how political knowledge, interest, internal efficacy, media use, education, and institutional context shape different forms of participation. They want comparative evidence and mechanisms (e.g., mediation effects) across countries and generations, covering voting, conventional/unconventional activism, political consumerism, and related attitudes like trust.	A document is relevant if it substantively discusses politics and contains the keyword “politic” or its common variants (political, politics, politician), for example in phrases like “political participation,” “internal political efficacy,” or “political knowledge.” Studies of political behavior, institutions, or theory—such as work on political symbolism, political geography, or political consumerism—are also relevant when these terms are used in analytical text, not just in passing. A document is non-relevant if “politic” appears only as the adjective meaning “prudent” (e.g., “a politic choice”) or shows up solely in boilerplate, references, or metadata without real discussion of politics. Edge cases include near-terms like “policy,” “police,” or “polity,” and foreign-language cognates such as German “Politik” or French “politique,” which are topically related but may not match a strict “politic” query unless stemming or multilingual normalization is applied. High keyword frequency from duplicated passages or citation lists should not by itself determine relevance; the content should analyze or report on political phenomena.
1112	politisches interesse	The query seeks research on political interest—its measurement, trends over time, and key determinants such as education, age, gender, class, and political orientation—and how it affects participation and voting. It focuses largely on evidence from Germany (e.g., ALLBUS surveys), including youth dynamics, euroskepticism, and the roles of resources and media.	A document is relevant if it directly examines or measures citizens’ political interest, its determinants, trends, or effects—for example, analyses using ALLBUS 1980–2002 that test education, age, gender, party support, and cohort/period influences, or reports showing that higher education predicts greater political interest. Studies that link political interest to mobilization and behavior (e.g., euroskeptics’ turnout and party choice, or politainment’s impact moderated by interest) are also relevant, as are works that define political interest versus apathy and document youth or gender gaps with indicators and empirical results. By contrast, texts about “Interessen” as group or institutional interests—such as federal mixed financing, interest representation of the homeless, or religious “interest” as a legitimacy device—are non-relevant unless they explicitly analyze individuals’ interest in politics. Edge cases include pieces that only mention political interest without data or theory (weak relevance) and educational or DDR studies that assess interest in political/ideological learning, which are relevant if they operationalize and report measures of political interest.
1156	religion	The user is seeking scholarly analyses of religion’s role in modern societies, focusing on how it intersects with the state, politics, inequality, nationalism, and civil society. They want comparative and empirical research on secularization trends, state regulation and favoritism, public attitudes, and the social and economic effects of religiosity across countries.	A document is relevant to the query “religion” when it substantively examines religion as belief, practice, community, or institution, or analyzes how religion intersects with politics, economics, law, identity, or social inclusion. Clear examples include research on religion in International Relations, youth movements like New Age/evangelicalism/Salafism, cross-national measures of state regulation or favoritism toward religion, and studies linking religion to nationalism, welfare attitudes, or economic development. Region- or method-focused works (e.g., the Oxford Handbook on Ireland, post-communist civil society, ISSP/WVS-based analyses) are relevant when religion is the central analytic category rather than a passing descriptor. Non-relevant items are those that invoke “religion” only metaphorically, mention it in passing without analysis, or discuss culture/national identity without engaging religious beliefs, institutions, or religiosity. Edge cases that should still count as relevant include studies of secularization, “no religion,” interfaith marriage, church–state policy, or “religiosity” under different labels (faith, public religion), whereas pieces that only cite “religion” in a title or dataset metadata without discussing it are not.
11910	persönlichkeit	The user seeks an overview of personality (Persönlichkeit)—its definitions, development, and measurement (e.g., Big Five)—and how personality relates to work, learning/therapy, identity, and social-political attitudes such as authoritarianism, prejudice, and populism.	A document is relevant if it analyzes personality as a psychological or sociological construct—defining traits, measuring them (e.g., Big Five), tracing their development or change, or linking personality to outcomes such as work socialization, prejudice, learning, or well-being. Empirical studies on the authoritarian personality, longitudinal research on how early career shapes personality, neurosci explanations of how personality forms, or methods papers proposing short personality scales are strong matches. Content that centers on “personalities” as notable individuals (e.g., historical or scientific personalities) is only relevant if it explicitly theorizes personality formation or attributes in those figures, not merely profiles or reputational narratives. Items focused on identity, culture, or class are borderline unless they directly tie identity constructs to personality traits or development. Edge cases include metaphorical or collective uses (e.g., “collective personality” of a group) and educational or therapeutic frameworks that place personality at the core; these are relevant when they articulate how personality is conceptualized, measured, or changed, and less so if “Personality” is used loosely without analytical depth.
12195	persönlichkeitsmerkmale	The user seeks academic information on personality traits and their measurement (e.g., Big Five, authoritarianism) and how these traits relate to outcomes such as political knowledge and attitudes, educational transitions, work behavior, and social engagement. They are interested in survey-based studies, validation of brief scales, and comparisons of personality effects with demographic or contextual factors.	A document is relevant if it directly examines, measures, or models Persönlichkeitsmerkmale (personality traits) or closely synonymous constructs (e.g., Persönlichkeitsfaktoren), such as studies using Big Five scales, authoritarism/alienation indices, or validated short instruments, and if it links these traits to outcomes (political knowledge, partnership conflict, police selection, student performance, volunteering). It is also relevant when it focuses on methodological issues of trait measurement (scale validation, factor analyses) or reports clear associations between trait profiles and behaviors or attitudes (e.g., right/materialist orientations among highly authoritarian individuals, time-perspective profiles tied to traits). Documents that merely discuss Persönlichkeitsentwicklung (personality development) or identity in broad terms without specifying or operationalizing traits, or that mention traits only in passing without analysis, are non-relevant. Edge cases include studies on adjacent constructs (e.g., technophile attitudes or “Kompetenzerwartung”) that function as trait-like dispositions—these can be relevant if explicitly treated as Persönlichkeitsmerkmale, but not if framed solely as situational attitudes or institutional factors. Synonym and morphology variations in German (e.g., Persönlichkeitsfaktoren, Merkmale der Persönlichkeit) count, while generic uses of “persönlich” or purely institutional analyses without trait variables do not.
1259	sexuelle orientierung	The user is seeking research and resources on sexual orientation, especially in Germany. Focus areas include prevalence of sexual minorities, coming-out experiences, links with mental health, discrimination and human rights, and institutional responses across healthcare, education, sports, law, and family policy.	A document is relevant if it engages directly with sexual orientation (sexuelle Orientierung) as a core topic—defining or categorizing identities (e.g., heterosexual, bisexual, homosexual), measuring prevalence, or examining coming out, discrimination, health, policy, or family/education impacts. Examples include surveys that stratify respondents by orientation to analyze mental health outcomes, studies of LSBT youth reporting discrimination and support needs, or human-rights/healthcare guidance that addresses protections and treatment specific to sexual orientation. Content is non-relevant when “sexual” refers to different issues (e.g., sexual harassment policies) or when sexual orientation is only name-checked in a glossary or a broad diversity list without substantive discussion. Edge cases: pieces centered on SOGI or queer critiques of hetero/homonormativity are relevant; works about gender identity alone (geschlechtliche Identität) without linking to orientation, or cultural items (e.g., theater, sports debates) that mention orientation only in passing, are marginal.
12604	personal	The query seeks scholarly works related to “personal,” emphasizing personality traits (e.g., Big Five) and their effects on behavior, social decision-making, politics, education, and participation. It also spans personalization in media, personal privacy and data protection, and legal/philosophical notions of personhood and legal personality (including AI).	A document is relevant to the query “personal” when it explicitly discusses personal aspects, such as privacy and personal data, personal relevance in judgments, or personalized content and communication (e.g., analyses of personal data protection in Russia, experiments on personal relevance in justice inferences, studies of personalized news portals or personalized political tweets). Content using close morphological variants like “personalized,” “personalization,” or “personal data” typically qualifies, while terms like “interpersonal” can be borderline because they concern between-person dynamics rather than an individual’s personal sphere. By contrast, pieces focused on “personality” traits or “legal personality” (e.g., Big Five effects on grades, AI legal personality) may be non-relevant if the user intends “personal” in the sense of privacy, individuality, or personalization, despite lexical overlap. Near-spelling terms such as “personnel,” or philosophical uses of “person”/“personhood” without a focus on personal information or individualized content, should be treated as non-relevant. Edge cases include documents where “personal” appears only in passing (titles, citations) or in compound phrases like “personal distribution of income”; these are relevant only if the main discussion centers on personal-level topics rather than incidental mention.
1293	alcohol	The user seeks an evidence-based overview of alcohol’s societal and public health impacts, focusing on how stigma, pricing/taxation and affordability, and policy measures relate to consumption patterns and harms. They also want findings on psychological and social determinants of drinking (e.g., adolescent and partner influences, identity, expectancy effects) and the effectiveness of interventions such as warnings, bans, and messaging, particularly in Europe.	A document is relevant if it focuses on beverage alcohol (ethanol) and its consumption, harms, or regulation—such as studies on stigma toward heavy drinkers, affordability and taxation of beer/wine/spirits, BAC laws, adolescent drinking, intervention effectiveness (e.g., bans, warning labels, media campaigns), or outcomes like DALYs, aggression, and traffic fatalities. Empirical work on patterns by beverage type, social determinants (education, gender, occupation), and mechanisms (e.g., oxytocin, risk-taking) also counts, as do evaluations of Alcoholics Anonymous or historical temperance movements when tied to alcohol use and policy. Content is only partially relevant if alcohol appears tangentially—say, as one of several risk factors—or if the primary focus is general risk perception or self-esteem with minimal alcohol-specific analysis. Non-relevant items include uses of non-beverage alcohols (isopropyl, hand sanitizers), sugar alcohols, organic chemistry discussions of “alcohols,” or metaphorical uses of “spirits,” unless explicitly linked to drinking behavior or policy. Edge cases like methanol poisoning or lab tasks using alcohol as a stimulus are relevant when they address beverage alcohol harms or behavior change, but not when alcohol is merely a solvent or incidental material.
1326	demokratie	The user seeks a scholarly overview of democracy, including its historical development, forms and theories (representative, direct, participatory, deliberative), conditions for emergence and stability, and ways to measure its quality and performance. They also want analyses of contemporary challenges—globalization, media, populism, religion and equality—and empirical evidence, especially for Germany and in comparative perspective (e.g., ALLBUS/WVS).	A document is relevant if it substantively examines democracy as a political concept, regime type, or practice—such as its history from antiquity to modernity, typologies (representative, plebiscitary, deliberative, participatory, direct), conditions of emergence and consolidation, measurement of its quality, or crises—with concrete analyses or data (e.g., ALLBUS, World Values Survey). Works that connect democracy to adjacent themes like globalization, media, equality and dignity, religion–state relations, populism, or transitions in Latin America and Eastern Europe, as well as case-focused discussions (e.g., direct democracy in German federalism), are also relevant. Normative or philosophical treatments (aphoristic defenses, radical or decolonial critiques, Tocqueville/Weber interpretations) qualify when democracy remains the central object of inquiry. Non-relevant items merely name-drop “Demokratie,” use it metaphorically, or focus primarily on unrelated methods or economics where democracy is incidental. Edge cases include German compounds and adjectival forms (Demokratietheorie, Postdemokratie, demokratisch), which should count, whereas occurrences confined to titles, publisher names, or brief mentions without substantive discussion should not.
13621	kultur	The user seeks a comprehensive, scholarly overview of the concept of culture—its definitions and theoretical evolution (classical to post-classical), and its roles as communication, integration/disintegration, and social practice. They are interested in how culture intersects with media, politics, economy, gender, globalization, and key debates such as the Snow–Leavis “two cultures” controversy.	A document is relevant if it centrally examines Kultur as a concept or domain, for example by defining it, tracing its etymology, or theorizing it in sociology or cultural studies (e.g., classical vs. postclassical culture theory, culture as communication, culture’s role in integration or disintegration). Analyses of specific arenas such as the Snow–Leavis “two cultures” debate, political culture, culture and gender around 1800/1900, globalization and media, or the culture and creative industries also count as relevant, as do substantive discussions of compound notions like Unternehmenskultur, Streitkultur, or interkulturelle Kommunikation. Documents that merely mention the word in passing, list it only in bibliographic titles without treatment, or use “Kultur” in unrelated senses (e.g., microbial/bacterial cultures or horticulture) are non-relevant. Edge cases include table-of-contents style overviews: they are relevant if the items demonstrably engage Kultur (e.g., Marcuse on Eros and culture, Sennett on the culture of capitalism), but not if “Kultur” appears only as a buzzword. Variants and plurals (Kulturen) or closely related German compounds are relevant when the surrounding text clearly analyzes cultural meanings, practices, or values rather than using the term as a label.
14255	konsum	The query seeks comprehensive, German-language research on consumption (Konsum) from sociological, economic, and policy perspectives. It spans local and sustainable consumption, consumption’s role in identity and recognition, governance and historical transitions (e.g., Soviet/DDR), demographic effects on demand, and empirical monitoring of psychoactive substance use.	A document is relevant if it centrally addresses consumption (Konsum) as behavior, practice, or concept—whether socio-cultural, economic, political, or public-health related. Examples include analyses of locally oriented consumption among multi-local households, discussions of sustainable consumption in food (e.g., organic purchases and consumption biographies), prevalence studies of substance use (“Konsum von Alkohol/Cannabis”), theoretical work on recognition, governmentality and the politics of consumer society, or economic/demographic studies of household consumption by purpose. Historical and institutional perspectives—such as DDR consumer shortages, debates over “richtiger/falscher Konsum,” or educational programs for sustainable consumption—also count, as do operational measures like expenditures or prevalence rates. Non-relevant items are those where “Konsum” appears only tangentially (e.g., in passing or metadata), as a proper noun or brand without discussing consumer practices, or as a homograph/near miss unrelated to consumption. Edge cases: compound and variant forms (Konsums, konsumieren, Konsumgesellschaft, Nichtkonsum), domains like media consumption and large local investments, and drug-use contexts are relevant; documents where consumption is a minor aside should be deprioritized.
1537	social media	The user is seeking scholarly analyses of how social media operates as a socio-technical system shaping news production, agenda setting, policy, trust, social cohesion, relationships, health behaviors, and organizational strategies. They want evidence-based insights into mechanisms like commodification, engagement, media literacy, and platform logic across diverse contexts and case studies.	A document is relevant to the query “social media” when it primarily examines social media platforms, practices, or effects—for example, studies of Facebook/Twitter agenda setting, newsroom use and commodification of social media, disaster communication via social platforms, social cohesion impacts, or policy influence sparked by trending topics. Theoretical or methodological work that analyzes “social media logic,” datafication, platform-specific engagement, or sectoral uses (museums’ Facebook/Twitter strategies, sports marketing on social networks, adolescent sexual risk on Instagram/Snapchat) is also relevant, even if it uses terms like “social networking sites” or refers only to platform names. Regional case studies (e.g., Indonesia, Pakistan, Lebanon) and cross-media comparisons that explicitly include social media metrics, exposure, or posting behavior likewise count. Non-relevant items are those that mention social media only in passing, focus solely on legacy media without a social component, use “social networks” to mean offline interpersonal networks, or discuss “media” generically without digital social platforms. Edge cases include historical or “social movement media” analyses that mix offline and online channels (partially relevant if they analyze digital platforms) and media literacy/trust studies that are relevant only when they explicitly measure or theorize social media use rather than general media consumption.
15423	jugendliche	The user is seeking comprehensive academic research on adolescents, especially those with migration backgrounds, in Germany and related contexts. They want empirical and longitudinal studies covering integration, school-to-work transitions, social and family relations, leisure, multilingualism, and the effects of youth and labor-market policies.	A document is relevant if it primarily studies or targets adolescents/youth (e.g., school-age cohorts or young people in transition to work), explicitly labeling them as “Jugendliche” and presenting age-defined data, samples, or interventions. For example, surveys of 10th graders in NRW, longitudinal panels on Turkish-origin and Aussiedler youth, analyses of gymnasium participation in the Mikrozensus, or studies of transitions in the DJI Übergangspanel are clearly relevant; even focused topics like hairstyle preferences among 14–26-year-olds or youth leisure/violence/drug attitudes qualify when adolescents are the main unit of analysis. A document is non-relevant if it discusses general population policies without youth-specific findings, uses “jugendlich” only as a stylistic adjective (e.g., “youthful style”), or mentions adolescents only in passing without data or conclusions about them. Edge cases include mixed-age samples where adolescents are one subgroup (relevant if substantive subgroup results are reported), studies of “young adults” stretching to mid-20s (relevant if adolescent-range data are included), or historical/DDR contexts that still analyze youth behavior or perceptions. Clear age ranges, school grades (e.g., 7th, 10th), or labels like SGB II youth, migrant-background youth associations, and panel designs strengthen relevance; vague references to “youth” without defined samples or outcomes weaken it.
1552	religiosität	The user is seeking sociological research on religiosity—its definitions, dimensions, and measurement (e.g., via ALLBUS)—including distinctions between Christian and alternative/spiritual forms and their development over time in Germany and Europe. They also want evidence on how religiosity relates to demographics and social outcomes such as morality, fertility, gender-role attitudes, antisemitism, youth spirituality, and well-being.	A document is relevant if it directly analyzes, defines, measures, or explains patterns, drivers, or outcomes of religiosity (Religiosität), including individual or group religiosity across traditions (e.g., Christian, Islamic, “alternative”/spiritual) and life stages. Strong signals include empirical work using surveys like ALLBUS, EVS, or ISSP; factor analyses of dimensions (e.g., mysticism, magic, health practices, Huber’s centrality/Z-scale); and studies linking religiosity to topics such as fertility, gender-role values, antisemitism, well-being, or East/West differences. Items are non-relevant if they only mention the term in passing, focus solely on church institutions or theology without addressing religiosity as a construct, or discuss “religion” generically without measurement, conceptualization, or behavioral/attitudinal indicators. Edge cases counted as relevant include work using near-synonyms (Spiritualität, Kirchlichkeit, Glaube) when tied to religiosity constructs, subgroup analyses (e.g., youth, Muslim minorities, clergy), methodological papers on measuring religiosity, and trend studies on secularization that quantify religiosity. Conversely, pieces about religious history, liturgy, or culture with no treatment of religiosity levels, dimensions, or correlates—even if the word appears—should be considered non-relevant.
15640	karriere	Find scholarly analyses of the concept of career and career success, including subjective vs. objective dimensions and the influence of gender, dual-career partnerships, and international mobility (expatriates/flexpatriates). Emphasis is on academic and NPO contexts, work–life balance, and institutional factors shaping career trajectories.	A document is relevant if it substantively treats “Karriere” (career) as the main topic—defining it, measuring career success, mapping career paths, or analyzing determinants—such as studies on expatriates/flexpatriates, dual‑career couples, women in science, or careers in specific fields (e.g., chemistry, theology, engineering) and sectors (e.g., NPOs). It remains relevant when the concept appears via variants and related terms (Karrieren, Doppelkarriere, Karrierefrau, berufliche Laufbahn), includes empirical comparisons or regional differences, or uses theoretical frames (e.g., Bourdieu’s field/habitus) to explain career trajectories. Documents are non‑relevant if “Karriere” is only a passing or metaphorical mention (e.g., the “career” of terrorists or of a concept), confined to metadata, or if the focus is unrelated to occupational/academic careers. Edge cases include historical handbooks that chart stages of careers (relevant), critiques of gendered career discourse and work–life tensions (relevant), and pieces where “Dual Career” appears in English within German text (still relevant). Texts that omit the word “Karriere” but clearly discuss career processes via synonyms like Laufbahn or beruflicher Aufstieg can also be judged relevant.
15721	job	The query seeks research-based insights on job quality and security—how job satisfaction, job fit, and specific job attributes (e.g., security, autonomy, pay) affect well-being, performance, mobility, and turnover across countries. It also looks for evidence on gender/cultural differences and policy levers such as employer job security guarantees and regulations.	Because the query is the single word “job,” the most relevant documents are those primarily about employment positions and labor-market topics—such as job quality, job security, job satisfaction, job mobility, hiring/quitting, and workplace outcomes or policies. Items like studies on job insecurity and satisfaction, job guarantees, graduate jobs classifications, refugees’ job quality, supervisory roles and satisfaction, and cross-country analyses of job attributes are highly relevant; documents using close synonyms (employment, work, occupation, position, role) also qualify if the focus is clearly on employment. A document can still be relevant even if the word “job” appears infrequently, provided its core analysis concerns employment outcomes or job design; conversely, texts that only mention “job” in passing while focusing on unrelated themes are weak matches. Non-relevant uses include “Job” as a proper noun (the biblical figure), surnames (e.g., “Jobs”), technical/computing senses (print/cron jobs, task schedulers), media titles (e.g., “The Italian Job”), or slang where employment is not the topic. Edge cases include education or skills research that is relevant if it explicitly links to employment outcomes (e.g., graduate jobs, on-the-job training), but general well-being or organizational topics with no employment linkage would not be.
15758	job satisfaction	The user seeks empirical research on the determinants of job satisfaction and how they differ across demographics, roles, occupations, and countries. They want evidence on factors such as job characteristics, work-life balance, stress, and organizational commitment, and how these relate to outcomes like performance, turnover, and well-being.	A document is relevant if it directly examines job satisfaction as a primary variable—measuring its levels, determinants, or consequences—and may do so within specific groups (e.g., men vs. women, supervisors vs. non-supervisors, Gen Y, housekeepers) or contexts (e.g., work-life balance, job insecurity, job characteristics, QWL), often using survey data or validated scales. Studies where job satisfaction acts as a mediator or moderator in models of performance, commitment, turnover intent, or well-being are also relevant, as are analyses using large datasets like ISSP, EVS, EU-SILC, or PIAAC that compare satisfaction across countries, ages, or occupations. Papers are non-relevant if they mention “job satisfaction” only tangentially, focus on other forms of satisfaction (e.g., customer or life satisfaction) without explicitly linking to job satisfaction, or use “satisfaction” in unrelated senses. Edge cases include research on engagement, stress, or organizational commitment: these are relevant only if the relationship to job satisfaction is explicitly modeled or tested; domain-specific or methodological duplicates remain relevant when job satisfaction is a focal outcome, but mere passing references or generic “job” discussions are not.
1635	depression	The user seeks scholarly information on depression, including its prevalence across populations, validated assessment tools, and associations with comorbidities and social factors (e.g., pain, obesity, health literacy, ostracism, bullying, loneliness, age, gender). They also want insights into consequences like suicide risk, quality of life, and political engagement, and implications for prevention and clinical interventions.	A document is relevant to the query “depression” when it directly examines depressive disorders or symptoms in humans, such as studies reporting prevalence, risk factors, comorbidities, measurement tools (e.g., PHQ-9, BDI, CDSS), or treatment/clinical implications. For example, research on depression in schizophrenia using PANSS and the Calgary Depression Scale, adolescent studies linking bullying, loneliness, rumination, or pain intensity to depressive symptoms, or surveys connecting health literacy or age with depression are all clearly relevant. Documents that focus on adjacent phenomena but use depression as a key outcome or mediator—like effects on political participation or peer ostracism—are still relevant if depression is measured and interpreted as a central construct. Edge cases include pieces about “depression” in non-mental-health senses (economic recessions, geological depressions), which are non-relevant, and work on animal depression or veterinary antidepressants, which may be only partially relevant unless explicitly tied back to human depressive disorder constructs and diagnostics. Mentions of depression that are incidental (e.g., a covariate in a study primarily about unrelated outcomes without analysis of depressive symptoms) are marginally relevant at best.
16523	klimaschutz	The user is looking for analyses of climate protection policies and instruments across local, national, and international levels, including their integration into planning, barriers to implementation, and drivers of public support. They want case-based insights and recent political developments affecting climate action (e.g., Paris Agreement dynamics, US and EU policy, municipal initiatives).	A document is relevant to the query “klimaschutz” when it focuses on climate protection/mitigation measures, policies, or governance aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, whether at municipal, national, or international level—for example, integrated municipal climate protection concepts, EU or U.S. CO2 standards for power plants, evaluations of the Paris Agreement, or pricing of emissions. Analyses of public opinion and political dynamics are also relevant if they affect support for or implementation of climate protection, such as surveys on willingness to back climate policies, narrative strategies to build majorities, or indices that measure municipal engagement in climate mitigation and adaptation. Planning and implementation contexts count when they integrate Klimaschutz into spatial or regional development, funding programs (e.g., Kommunalrichtlinie), or cross-border energy transition projects with explicit mitigation objectives. By contrast, pieces that address only climate adaptation without linking to mitigation, general energy geopolitics or trade with only passing references to climate goals, or environmental topics (biodiversity, flood control) lacking an explicit mitigation focus are non-relevant. Edge cases include methodological or governance studies (e.g., pretesting texts for climate interventions, federalism’s impact on building-sector rules); these are relevant if they substantively inform the design, adoption, or effectiveness of climate protection instruments, but not if they merely name-drop Klimaschutz.
1670	rassismus	The user seeks comprehensive, scholarly information on racism, including its definitions, historical development, and major forms (e.g., antisemitic, anti-Black, and anti-Muslim/“neo-racism”). They also want analyses of how racism operates through language, media, nationalism, and the economy, along with empirical findings and policy or civil-society responses in Germany and Europe.	A document is relevant to the query “rassismus” if it directly defines, analyzes, measures, or historicizes racism, including discussions of antisemitism, anti-Black racism, anti-Muslim “neo-racism,” racism in language and media, or policy and NGO responses to racism. Empirical studies using surveys or methods (e.g., ALLBUS regressions, structural equation models), theoretical accounts linking racism to nationalism, class, colonialism, or discourse, and historical overviews from early caste systems to the Holocaust and post-1945 developments are clearly on-topic. Texts centered on xenophobia, ethnocentrism, or “Ausländerfeindlichkeit” are relevant when they explicitly compare or distinguish these from racism; if they discuss generic prejudice or immigration policy without tying it to racism, they are borderline or non-relevant. Non-relevant items include uses of “Rasse” in biological taxonomy or animal breeding, casual metaphorical mentions, or acronyms/brand names that match the string (e.g., ICE, ZARA) without engaging anti-racism work. Edge cases like critiques of anti-racism strategies, methodological debates, or governance measures are relevant if they substantively engage the concept or practice of racism in context.
17057	kinderbetreuung	The user seeks comprehensive information on childcare, including types of care (institutional vs. family), availability and hours, costs and funding, and legal/regulatory frameworks. They also want evidence and comparisons—especially for Austria, Germany, and the EU—on how childcare provision influences work–family balance, gender equality, and fertility.	A document is relevant if it primarily addresses Kinderbetreuung (child care) as a system or practice—e.g., describing forms of care (Krippe, Kindergarten, Tagesmutter), structural features (opening hours, age limits, group size), legal frameworks, funding/costs, quality, supply-demand statistics, or employer-provided childcare models. Works that analyze how childcare relates to work–family reconciliation, fertility decisions, or gender equality, including cross-country or historical comparisons, are also relevant when childcare is a central variable with concrete data or policy discussion. Examples of strong relevance include Austrian or EU overviews of childcare regulations and utilization, evaluations of corporate childcare initiatives, or reports on user satisfaction and quality standards. Non-relevant items are those that only mention Kinderbetreuung in passing within broader topics (such as the gender pay gap or general household labor) without substantive detail on care provision, policy, or usage, or where the term appears only in an index or brief aside. Edge cases like youth perspectives on ideal care, analyses focused on monetary subsidies for under-6s, or historical narratives remain relevant if they explicitly define and assess childcare arrangements; by contrast, purely methodological notes without findings or pieces that shift away from childcare to unrelated family policy issues would be marginal.
1719	vertrauen	The user seeks an interdisciplinary overview of trust (Vertrauen)—what it is, how it develops and can turn into mistrust, its moral limits, and key types (generalized, interpersonal, institutional). They want theories and empirical findings on determinants and functions of trust in democracy, organizations, social relations, and media, including debates over civil-society vs. institutional mechanisms and measurement (e.g., ALLBUS).	A document is relevant if it substantively examines Vertrauen (trust) as a concept—how it is defined, formed, limited, and how it turns into Misstrauen (mistrust)—using philosophical, sociological, political, or social-psychological frameworks. Strong signals include differentiating types of trust (generalized vs. interpersonal, institutional vs. personal, strategic/rational vs. moral/identity-based), specifying mechanisms that generate trust (e.g., civil society vs. institutional fairness, leadership and organizational culture), and presenting empirical evidence or measures (such as ESS/ALLBUS surveys, media or political trust cases). Analyses that model causal pathways, critique game-theoretic reductions, or show the co-evolution of trust with institutions and networks in democracies are especially relevant. Non-relevant items merely mention “vertrauen” rhetorically, revolve around unrelated meanings (legal trusts, “trusted” computing), or discuss cooperation/management without treating trust as the central analytic variable. Edge cases include work centered on mistrust or deception (still relevant if tied to trust dynamics), bibliographic lists or duplicated abstracts (weakly relevant unless they add analysis), and narrow sectoral studies (youth work, journalism) that count only when they explicitly explain determinants, measurement, and effects of trust.
1743	lebenszufriedenheit	The user is seeking an overview of research on life satisfaction, especially in Germany, including how it is defined, measured, and how it varies across groups. They want evidence on determinants such as religion, income and employment, parenthood, migration background, education setting, region/urban context, physical attractiveness, retirement, and COVID-19, as well as the datasets commonly used (e.g., ALLBUS, SOEP, pairfam, NEPS, SHARE, GEDA).	A document is relevant if it directly analyzes Lebenszufriedenheit (life satisfaction) as a central construct—measured or modeled with surveys, correlations/regressions, or established datasets (e.g., ALLBUS, SOEP, pairfam, NEPS, SHARE). Highly relevant examples include studies on how evangelical faith, parenthood, migration background, physical attractiveness, retirement, pandemic-related shocks, or regional context affect Lebenszufriedenheit, especially when distinguishing general vs. domain satisfactions or linking area-specific satisfaction to overall life satisfaction. Works that focus only on domain-specific satisfaction (job, partnership, income, infrastructure) are relevant only when they explicitly relate those domains to overall Lebenszufriedenheit or use Lebenszufriedenheit as the outcome; otherwise they are non-relevant. Texts using near-synonyms such as subjektives Wohlbefinden, happiness, or the Satisfaction With Life Scale count as relevant when clearly equated with Lebenszufriedenheit, whereas pieces that merely mention the term in passing (e.g., a citation or policy slogan) or discuss customer/service satisfaction are not. Edge cases include capitalization or language variants (Lebenszufriedenheit/lebenszufriedenheit, “life satisfaction”) and population-focused analyses (mothers, immigrants, students) that remain relevant if life satisfaction is central, while duplicates or abstracts listing the term without substantive analysis are only weakly relevant.
17717	kinderwunsch	The user seeks research-based overviews of Kinderwunsch (desire for children), including how it is defined and measured, its determinants across the life course and partnership dynamics, and recent trends in German-speaking countries. They want to understand how values, socioeconomic conditions, and medical/biological factors affect the gap between desired and realized fertility and the role of policies and reproductive medicine in fulfilling childbearing intentions.	A document is relevant if it focuses on Kinderwunsch (the desire to have children) by defining or measuring it (e.g., ideal vs intended vs expected/realistic number of children), analyzing its determinants (age, partnership status, socioeconomic factors, values), or linking it to realized fertility and family planning behavior. Examples of clearly relevant content include theoretical frameworks (biological, demographic, sociological, socio-psychological), dyadic negotiation of partners’ wishes, subgroup analyses (e.g., homosexual men, students, childless vs parents), and empirical work using surveys like GGS, GGP, PPAS, or the Mikrozensus, including trends, international comparisons, and operationalization choices. Studies that connect work–family arrangements, gender role attitudes, or policy/structural conditions to childbearing intentions, as well as medical/clinical discussions of infertility and reproductive medicine framed around fulfilling Kinderwunsch, are also relevant. A document is non-relevant if it treats only aggregate fertility levels or demographic aging without discussing individuals’ childbearing intentions, or if “Kinderwunsch” appears merely in a table of contents, citation list, or as a passing term unrelated to desire/intent. Edge cases include clinical reports focused solely on treatment efficacy without linking to intentions (weak relevance), or values/role-attitude studies that are relevant only when they explicitly tie those constructs to desired family size, fertility intentions, or the likelihood of realizing a childbearing wish.
1817	mediennutzung	Find academic research on media use in Germany, focusing on patterns, motives, and group differences (e.g., children, students, migrants, East vs. West) and their links to socialization, education, and political participation. Include reviews and methods for measuring media usage, especially in mobile and online contexts.	A document is relevant if it focuses on media use behaviors (Mediennutzung) itself—how, how much, and why people use media—across groups, platforms, or contexts, using empirical data or theoretical framing. Examples include studies of children’s and adolescents’ media use under conditions of social inequality, East–West German differences in TV consumption, student or migrant media habits, mobile and social media usage in everyday life, usage typologies and motives, or operationalizations of use in surveys (e.g., ALLBUS) and new measurement tools (e.g., WebTrack/AppKit). Also relevant are analyses linking media use to outcomes such as political participation, education, or family dynamics, so long as usage is a central variable being measured or explained. Non-relevant would be work that centers on media content, policy, or effects without analyzing users’ behaviors, purely theoretical pieces where Mediennutzung is only a side note, or industry reach summaries that lack user-level patterns or motivations. Edge cases like live tweeting as political performance, media competence in schools, local vs national public spheres, or DDR-era youth research are relevant if they report concrete usage patterns, motivations, or measurement; broad integration or cultural identity discussions without specific usage evidence are not.
1825	glaubwürdigkeit	The user is seeking an overview of credibility in communication—how it is defined, attributed, and measured—especially in mass media and politics. They want to understand its key dimensions, how journalists and institutions shape it, and its effects on media use, public trust, and online contexts like anonymity.	A document is relevant if it foregrounds “Glaubwürdigkeit” (credibility) as a core concept or variable—defining it, modelling its dimensions (e.g., competence, trustworthiness, dynamism, similarity, social approval, likability), measuring it, or analyzing its effects and rhetoric in communication. Highly relevant examples include studies of media credibility and usage, conversation-analytic work on defending/attacking credibility in disputes, analyses of credibility under internet anonymity, or surveys linking perceived news credibility with political attitudes. Also relevant are sector-specific pieces where credibility is the main stake—such as the credibility of the WHO after the swine flu, UN peacekeeping, NATO deterrence, political leaders (Macron, Lula), or the vocational training system—when they examine causes, consequences, or strategies to bolster or erode credibility. Non-relevant or only marginally relevant items mention the term in passing without conceptualization or measurement, focus primarily on other topics (e.g., a general media-effects overview or historical statistics report) and use “glaubwürdig” as a generic adjective rather than an analytic focus. Edge cases: methods papers on validating qualitative research or prebunking tools that rate source credibility are relevant, while texts on anonymity or morality qualify only if they explicitly connect those constructs to how credibility is assigned or perceived.
18263	mitarbeiter	Find research and guidance on employees in organizations—especially HR strategies for older workers, onboarding and internal communication, training and qualification, participative culture and leadership styles, and challenges like technostress amid digital transformation.	A document is relevant if it substantively discusses employees (Mitarbeiter) in organizations—such as HR policies, leadership and communication, training and onboarding, wellbeing/technostress, demographic change, or participation—e.g., integrated personnel management for over‑50s, surveys of employees, or programs to integrate new staff. It also counts when specific employee groups are the focus, like wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiter at universities or freie Mitarbeiter at newspapers, provided their working conditions, roles, or management are analyzed. Non‑relevant items are those where “Mitarbeiter” appears only incidentally (staff lists, author affiliations, institutional directories, publication notes) or where related terms mean something else (e.g., Mitarbeit as “collaboration,” or the word appearing only in an organization’s name). Edge cases include gendered and inclusive variants (Mitarbeiterinnen, Mitarbeiter/‑innen, “Mitarbeiter innen” from OCR), morphological variants (singular/plural), and near‑synonyms (Beschäftigte, Personal, Belegschaft) that may be conceptually on‑topic despite lacking the exact keyword. Another edge case is whether “freie Mitarbeiter” (contractors) meet the user’s intent if they seek only formal employees, and cross‑lingual matches where English “employee(s)” are relevant even if the German keyword is absent.
1851	education	The user is seeking comparative, research-based insights on how education systems and attainment affect social inequality and life outcomes in Europe, including trends in educational homogamy, stratification, returns to education, and skill mismatches. They also want evidence on policy and institutional responses—such as inclusion, quality assurance, and STEM for SDG 4—and the roles of educators in aligning education with labor market and societal needs.	For the keyword query “education,” a document is relevant when education is a central focus—such as research on schooling systems, teaching and learning processes, educational attainment, policy and governance, or education’s social and economic outcomes. Examples include studies of educational homogamy across European cohorts, returns to education using PIAAC data, national reports on inclusion and quality (e.g., “Bildung in Deutschland”), analyses of STEM for SDG4, or work linking educational expansion to labor market stratification and voter turnout. Documents are less relevant if “education” is only mentioned tangentially (e.g., a passing reference to an Education Act, a funding body named Ministry of Education, or education used solely as a control variable in a study primarily about unrelated outcomes). Useful signals of relevance include repeated, substantive discussion of curricula, pedagogy, higher or vocational education, quality and inequality, or educational institutions, as well as keywords like schooling, learning, teacher training, attainment, or educational policy. Edge cases include domains like “patient education” or marketing portals: these can be relevant if they analyze educational content, delivery, or outcomes, but not if they merely name “education” without engaging with educational processes or systems.
18589	migranten	The user is seeking comprehensive research on migrants—mainly in Germany—covering education and labor market integration, health and mortality, media use, political participation, entrepreneurship, public attitudes, rights and policy frameworks, and statistical definitions such as migration background.	A document is relevant to the query “migranten” when it discusses people who are migrants (typically in the German context) and uses the term “Migranten” or close variants, focusing on their education, labor market outcomes, health (e.g., the healthy migrant effect), media use, entrepreneurship, rights, or political participation. Studies comparing migrants with natives (such as FSU, Turkish, or Jewish vs. ethnic German migrants), analyses of integration policy, or reports on “Menschen mit Migrationshintergrund,” “Zuwanderer,” “Spätaussiedler,” or “Migrantinnen und Migranten” also qualify as relevant. Content may be in German or English, and can still be relevant if it centers migrants without the exact keyword, as long as synonyms or group-specific labels are used. Non-relevant documents are those where “migranten” appears only incidentally or in unrelated senses (e.g., IT/data migration, animal/cell migration), brand or project names, or administrative metadata without substantive discussion of migrant people. Edge cases include mixed-language texts, OCR variants, or pieces about other countries that remain relevant if they analyze migrants’ social, economic, or legal situations; conversely, purely methodological papers that mention migrants only in passing would be weakly relevant.
18995	migrant	The user is seeking academic research on how migrants adapt and integrate in European host societies, especially Germany. They want determinants and outcomes such as social networks, neighborhood composition, language proficiency, rights knowledge, labor market transitions, identity, healthcare practices, and settlement intentions.	A document is relevant if it centers on people identified as migrants (or close variants like migrants, migrant workers, immigrants) and analyzes their experiences, determinants, or outcomes. Studies on integration, rights, networks, labor market trajectories, identity, or health care use—e.g., research on migrant–non‑migrant relationships in Germany or on migrant network effects on EU location choices—are strongly relevant. Content that only drops the term in passing, treats migration merely as background, or uses unrelated senses (animal migration or “migrating data”) is weakly relevant or non‑relevant. Edge cases include works about non‑migrants that directly examine their interactions with migrants (still relevant), pieces using related terms like refugees/asylum seekers (often relevant), and subgroup‑specific analyses (FSU migrants, Chinese migrants in Africa) which remain relevant if migrants are the focal actors. Duplicated abstracts, bibliographic lists, or broad overviews with little substantive discussion of migrants’ conditions are borderline, whereas empirical studies, policy analyses, and qualitative accounts that foreground migrants score highest.
19136	migra	The user is seeking comprehensive information on migration/immigration, including data-driven indicators and research, policy frameworks (EU/Germany/Portugal), and debates on integration, asylum/return, and socio-economic impacts. They want authoritative sources spanning national and global contexts (e.g., Global Compact, EU Pact, trade–migration links, remittances).	A document is relevant if it contains the stem “migra” in the context of human migration, such as migration/migrants (EN), migração/imigração/emigração (PT), migración (ES), or Migration (DE), and discusses topics like immigrant integration, asylum, deportation, return programs, or refugee family dynamics. Policy reports and statistical analyses (e.g., an Observatório das Migrações report in Portugal, studies on Eritrean and Syrian refugees in Germany, or EU/German migration pacts) are strong matches because they use the term repeatedly and substantively. Partial or noisy matches such as hyphenated or OCR-split forms (“migra tion”), accent-stripped variants, and prefixes like “imigra-” or “emigra-” should also be treated as relevant. Non-relevant hits include unrelated strings like “migraine/Migra-” medication names, or “data/TV network migration” if the intent is human mobility; these are edge cases that may be excluded unless the query is broadly about any kind of migration. Documents using the colloquial “la migra” for U.S. immigration enforcement are also relevant, even if written in Spanish.
20168	muslime	The user seeks an academic overview of Muslims in Germany and Europe, including youth socialization, religiosity, and community organization. It synthesizes research on attitudes toward and among Muslims (e.g., antisemitism and Islamophobia), media portrayals, right‑populist mobilization, and state–church policy frameworks across countries.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses Muslims (e.g., Muslime, Muslimen, Musliminnen, Muslim:innen, muslimisch) as a social or religious group, including studies of their attitudes, religiosity, discrimination/Islamophobia, organization, demographics, or policy debates in Germany or Europe. Examples include empirical analyses of antisemitic attitudes among Muslims by origin or religiosity, surveys comparing Muslims and Christians, research on anti-Muslim prejudice and right-populist mobilization, historical accounts of Muslim communities (e.g., Bosnia, Romania, Russia, Austria), and media or citizenship-policy studies that center Muslims. Variants and spellings using inclusive German (Muslim innen) or English equivalents (“Muslims”), as well as adjectival forms (muslimisch) and related terms (antimuslimisch, Islamfeindlichkeit), also signal relevance when Muslims are the focal category. Non-relevant items would treat Islam purely as abstract theology without engaging Muslims as people, mention “Muslim” only in passing or as a surname, or focus on other groups unless Muslims are a main point of comparison. Edge cases include media analyses that discuss “Islam” but clearly evaluate portrayals of Muslims, and cross-national surveys where few Muslims live yet attitudes toward Muslims drive hypotheses—both are still relevant.
20775	mobilität	The user is seeking a comprehensive overview of mobility—especially spatial and job-related mobility in Europe/Germany—covering forms such as multilocal living, commuting/relocation, and virtual mobility. They want determinants and infrastructures as well as documented impacts on family life, careers, social integration, health, and regional/urban development.	A document is relevant if it treats mobility as a core topic—for example spatial mobility linked to multilocal living (commuting, weekend commuting, residential moves), job-related mobility in Europe and its impacts on family life and careers, academic mobility, or virtual mobility and its relationship to physical movement. Empirical evidence such as long travel distances, high car use, EU cross-country surveys, life-course analyses of regional moves after training, or studies of children’s and students’ mobility strongly signals relevance. Theoretical treatments (e.g., referencing Simmel, Giddens, Urry) that conceptualize mobility/immobility, infrastructures that enable movement, and the interplay between social and spatial mobility are also pertinent even if the exact term appears sparingly. Non-relevant items use “Mobilität” only in passing, solely in citations, or in unrelated senses (e.g., mobile phones/IT data mobility) without implications for human or social movement. Edge cases include works on the mobility of goods/ideas or pure infrastructure specifications; these count only when explicitly framed within mobility studies or linked to human outcomes.
21196	motivation	The user seeks scholarly research on motivation and motives across diverse contexts (education, work, public service, religion, activism, sports, compliance, and online collaboration). They want determinants, measurement (e.g., intrinsic/extrinsic, affective contingencies), and effects of motivation on behavior and performance, with practical implications for management and policy.	For the query “motivation,” documents are relevant when they explicitly analyze motivation or motives, describe motivational constructs (e.g., intrinsic vs. extrinsic, public service motivation), or examine how motivation is measured, shaped, or linked to outcomes. Studies that test predictors or consequences of motivation in concrete domains—such as teacher work motivation affecting student learning, motive-specific affective contingencies measured via EMG, peer motivational climate predicting exercise enjoyment, or contributors’ motives in platforms like OpenStreetMap—are clearly relevant, as are typologies of motives (e.g., protesters’ or church–mission relationships) and taxonomies grounded in theory. Method-focused work that operationalizes motivation with validated instruments or models (factor analysis, regression, structural equations), or that distinguishes “motivation” from related traits and values, also counts. By contrast, pieces where “motivation” appears only in passing, is used as a generic buzzword, or refers to unrelated senses (e.g., a “motivation letter” template, “motive power” in engineering, or collections of motivational quotes without analysis) are non-relevant. Edge cases like criminological “motives” for noncompliance or justice motives are relevant if they systematically analyze reasons for behavior, whereas performance or policy papers that discuss outcomes without linking them to motives or motivational processes are not.
2160	beruf	The user seeks scholarly information on occupations in Germany, emphasizing how gender shapes occupational choice, employment/unemployment, part-time work, training pathways, and prestige. They also want insights on occupational classification and standardization, labor market projections, and trends in IT, social, green, and knowledge-intensive professions.	A document is relevant if it meaningfully discusses occupations/professions (der Beruf/die Berufe) or closely related constructs and uses the keyword or clear morphological variants (beruflich, Berufs-, Berufsausbildung, IT‑Berufe) in a substantive way. Examples of relevant content include analyses of gender segregation across occupations, dual vocational training, employment/unemployment by profession, prestige dynamics as female shares rise, occupational standardization (e.g., Berufsordnung, certification), or systems like ISCO and BERUFENET. Texts can also be relevant without the exact token “Beruf” if the core topic is the occupation concept (e.g., employment stability by profession, duration of family-related career interruptions by occupation, “green” or knowledge‑intensive occupations). Non‑relevant material would use the word only in passing or in unrelated senses (e.g., metaphorical/religious “Berufung,” legal “Berufung”/appeal, or compounds like Berufsverkehr/commuter traffic) without discussing occupations. Edge cases include English or mixed-language documents using “profession/occupation/job” that clearly target the same concept, and lists or datasets of job titles—these count if they enumerate or analyze occupations, but not if “Beruf” appears only in a header with no occupational content.
21846	links rechts	The user seeks research on the meaning, evolution, and measurement of the “left–right” political spectrum in Germany, including public understanding, party positioning, and comparative context. They want to know how social-structural and demographic factors (e.g., education, age, region) shape interpretations and whether the schema still functions as a useful heuristic.	A document is relevant if it explicitly treats Links–Rechts as the political left–right schema—defining or measuring it (e.g., 0=links to 10=rechts scales), tracing how the meanings of “links” (social equality, new social movements) and “rechts” (conservatism, traditionalism, extremism) change over time, or analyzing who associates which contents with these labels across education, region, and age. Studies using German survey data (ALLBUS, GLES), correspondence/topic analyses of open-ended associations, or cross-national comparisons of the Links–Rechts dimension are strong matches, as are pieces positioning parties or voters along that axis. Methodological discussions that assess the heuristic value or conceptualization of Links–Rechts (e.g., accuracy of party placements, multi-dimensional models) are also relevant. Non-relevant are uses where “links/rechts” means physical direction, handedness, web “links,” or legal “rights,” or where the terms appear only in passing without engaging the political dimension. Edge cases include work on left–right visual scale effects or symbolic hand hierarchies; these are only pertinent if the query targets semantics or measurement of the Links–Rechts schema rather than political ideology per se.
21879	links rechts skala	Find scholarly analyses of the Left–Right political self-placement scale (Links–Rechts Skala) in Germany, especially using ALLBUS/ESS data, assessing its meaning, validity, and stability over time. The user seeks evidence on its correlates and dynamics—class status, deprivation, values, party and regional patterns, youth interpretations, and survey measurement effects.	A document is relevant if it analyzes, constructs, validates, or substantively applies the political Left–Right scale (Links-Rechts Skala) as a measure of ideology, self-placement, or party positions. Clear examples include studies using ALLBUS or ESS data to relate Left–Right self-placement to class consciousness, perceived deprivation, or party convergence; work distinguishing general, economic, and socio-cultural Left–Right dimensions; or papers showing divergence between Left–Right self-placement and value-based indices. Methodological pieces that probe measurement issues—such as LISREL validation of scale structure, reliability across samples, or response biases from left-to-right versus right-to-left visual scale layouts—are also relevant. Non-relevant are documents where “links/rechts” denote spatial directions or legal rights, or where the Left–Right variable appears only as a minor control without substantive interpretation (e.g., a citizen-participation study that merely reports a nonsignificant Left–Right coefficient). Edge cases include discrimination or “Gastarbeiter” scales: they are relevant if the link to political Left–Right orientation is explicitly analyzed, and historical vote-mapping studies qualify if they operationalize an ideological Left–Right scale rather than using the terms loosely.
221	immigration	Seeks research on how immigration policy frameworks and immigrant composition influence public attitudes toward immigration and immigrants’ socioeconomic and political integration. Emphasizes cross-national evidence (e.g., EU, Germany, Australia, Canada, U.S.) on labor market impacts, welfare/crime perceptions, media framing, and governance.	A document is relevant to the query “immigration” when it substantively analyzes immigration policy, immigrant inflows, integration, or attitudes toward immigrants, rather than merely mentioning the term in passing. For example, studies comparing Australia and Germany’s immigration policies and their effects on public attitudes, analyses of EU8 inflows into Germany’s labor market, or work on the overcriminalization of immigration enforcement clearly qualify, as do surveys on immigrant integration (Eurobarometer), media framing of immigration, and skill and wage outcomes of immigrants in Canada. Content centered on “immigrants” (e.g., second-generation effects, family support, anti-discrimination policy impacts, immigrant-origin voter turnout) is typically relevant because it addresses consequences or perceptions of immigration, even if the word “immigration” is not the sole focus. Documents would be non-relevant if “immigration” appears only as a stray keyword, is used metaphorically or in unrelated domains (e.g., internal migration, data “migration”), or if the discussion is purely about emigration without a receiving-society angle. This paragraph is highly relevant because it repeatedly and directly examines immigration across policy, labor markets, culture, crime, welfare, media, and governance with concrete country cases and empirical findings.
22708	media use	The user is seeking scholarly analyses of media use—especially social and mobile—including how it is measured and how organizations leverage it. They want evidence on platform- and country-specific effects on trust, misinformation, political perceptions, life satisfaction, health/behavior, and economic outcomes.	A document is relevant if it examines, measures, or theorizes about media use—such as media consumption, news use, exposure, frequency/duration of use, or platform-specific behaviors—by individuals or organizations. Examples include studies tracking mobile or social media use (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Telegram), cross-national patterns of media consumption, or analyses linking media use to outcomes like trust, conspiracy beliefs, lifestyle politics, or life satisfaction, as well as methodological work proposing new measures of media use or audience overlap. Institutional cases (museums, newsrooms, sports organizations) are relevant when they analyze strategies, metrics, or patterns of social media use for distribution, engagement, or revenue. Non-relevant items are those focused mainly on industry policy, AI use in production, ethics, or media economics/commodification without analyzing usage behaviors, or pieces that discuss media trust/politics without measuring use. Edge cases include lists of accounts with minimal analysis, broad media environment descriptions without usage data, or papers where “use” refers to technology used by media rather than users’ or organizations’ media use—these are only marginally relevant at best.
2272	work life balance	Seek an evidence-based overview of work-life balance: its evolution, key determinants and inequalities, and how working hours, policies, and organizational programs affect outcomes across countries and groups. Identify effective employer strategies—especially in economic downturns—to improve employee well-being and promote gender equality.	A document is relevant if it directly defines, measures, or analyzes work–life balance and the factors or policies that affect it (for example, flexible scheduling, childcare, parental leave, job sharing, shift work, or control over work hours) and links these to outcomes such as satisfaction, health, gender equality, or job performance. Studies examining WLB in specific contexts—like effects of an economic downturn on employer programs, differences across EU welfare regimes, women in academia or athletic training, expatriate workers in GCC countries, hotel housekeepers, or temporary employment in Australia—are relevant because they explicitly connect work arrangements to the ability to balance work and personal life. Empirical work reporting drivers of (dis)satisfaction with WLB, such as excessive hours, shift patterns, or inability to influence schedules, and macro models that trace the evolution of WLB discourse also count as relevant. Content is non-relevant if it mentions “work–life balance” only in passing, uses “balance” metaphorically without discussing the work/personal interface, or focuses solely on unrelated labor or economic metrics without linking to employees’ capacity to manage family, health, or personal domains. Edge cases include language or region-specific analyses (e.g., German or Italian policy studies) that remain relevant if they center on WLB, and claims about flexible or temporary work that are only relevant when they empirically assess their impact on WLB outcomes.
22951	medienkonsum	The user is seeking an overview of media consumption (Medienkonsum), especially among youths, including usage patterns (TV, internet, smartphones), determinants, and documented effects on aggression, socialization, school performance, health, stereotypes, and political attitudes. They may also want findings on differences by gender and migration background and the shift from television to online and social media.	A document is relevant if it substantively examines media consumption (Medienkonsum) behaviors, measurement, patterns, determinants, or consequences, rather than just naming the term. Examples include surveys of youths’ TV/internet/smartphone use, analyses linking quantitative or qualitative media consumption to aggression, school performance, socialization or integration, or studies using indices such as action/horror film viewing or device ownership as proxies for consumption. Theoretical or review articles that systematize media effects or socialization and explicitly discuss how consumption varies by gender, migration status, age, or context are also relevant. Non-relevant items are those that only mention media consumption in passing within a long list of topics, focus primarily on media production or political strategy with no analysis of audience use, or use “consumption” in a non-media sense without clarifying a media-specific component. Edge cases include synonyms like Mediennutzung/Mediengebrauch (which should count), mixed-topic reports that are relevant only if they contain a dedicated section with findings on media consumption, and background references (e.g., noting a shift from TV to online) that are insufficient unless supported by data or focused discussion.
230	umweltbewusstsein	The user seeks academic information on Umweltbewusstsein (environmental awareness)—how it is defined and measured, its relationship to environmental behavior, and the factors mediating the awareness–action gap. They want empirical and theoretical studies (largely from German/European contexts) including social-psychological models, survey findings, methodological issues, and policy implications.	A document is relevant if it directly examines Umweltbewusstsein (environmental awareness)—for example by defining its cognitive components, modeling its link to Umweltverhalten (pro-environmental behavior), or analyzing survey data and policy implications. Strong signals include discussions of determinants (age, education, norms, responsibility attribution), domain applications (energy use, transport choices, waste/recycling), and methodological issues like social desirability bias, specificity mismatches, time horizon, or seasonality in behavior measures. Materials that only mention Umweltbewusstsein in passing—such as broad youth or policy reports where it is one of many topics, or a brief note that public awareness is “growing”—are only weakly relevant. Non-relevant items discuss “awareness” in non-environmental contexts, “environment” in technical/computing senses, or list the term as a keyword without substantive treatment. Edge cases include spelling variants (Umweltbewußtsein vs. Umweltbewusstsein), English equivalents (environmental consciousness/attitudes), and studies focused on incentives or organizational strategies that treat awareness as necessary but not sufficient; these are relevant when they explicitly link back to the concept and its behavioral implications.
23614	medien nutzung	The user seeks research-based information on media usage patterns—especially digital, social, and mobile—how they vary by platform and demographic group, and how they influence attitudes and everyday behaviors. The focus is on German-speaking contexts, including platform-specific effects (e.g., Telegram during COVID-19), youth and family settings, and longitudinal/comparative findings.	For the query “medien nutzung” (media use), documents are relevant when they analyze or describe how people use media—e.g., frequencies, platforms, contexts, demographics, or behavioral correlates. Clear matches include empirical studies linking COVID-19 conspiracy belief to platform use (Telegram, Facebook, YouTube), surveys of social media and messaging adoption (ARD/ZDF Onlinestudie, WhatsApp/Instagram trends), research on mobile media in public spaces or boredom prevention, and work on youth, family, or historical populations (DDR youth, Austrian households) that report concrete usage patterns. Also relevant are platform-specific or longitudinal comparisons, and pieces that operationalize media use (e.g., usage categories, time use, device ownership) even if embedded in broader questions. Less relevant are papers focused primarily on design or gender in digital artifacts, theoretical models of sociocultural change without usage data, or general discussions where media is background and usage is not measured or described. Edge cases include conceptual “Medienkompetenz” articles that treat media use as one sub-dimension, protest communication studies that touch on social media use, or methodological notes on sensors that mention capturing “Mediennutzung” but do not analyze it—these may be partially relevant depending on depth of usage detail.
2386	politische einstellung	The user is seeking scholarly research on political attitudes, particularly in Germany, examining East–West differences, youth and migrant groups, and changes since reunification. They want determinants (e.g., authoritarianism, education, unemployment), links to democracy and participation, and evidence from surveys such as ALLBUS, ISSP, and IEA.	A document is relevant if it analyzes, measures, or compares political attitudes (Einstellungen) of individuals or groups, such as studies of youth or regional differences, trends over time, or attitudes toward democracy, parties, institutions, minorities, or gender equality. Examples include survey-based analyses (e.g., ALLBUS, IEA) of East–West differences in democracy satisfaction, trust in institutions, left–right self-placement, right-wing extremism, or political interest and participation, as well as work on the political culture or attitudes of elites. Research into determinants and correlates of political attitudes—authoritarianism, ethnocentrism, education, unemployment, migration generation—based on empirical data is also relevant. Non-relevant items are those using “Einstellung” in other senses (hiring, settings), pieces about political institutions or policies without addressing people’s attitudes, or purely methodological/media-industry discussions unless they specifically examine journalists’ own political attitudes. Edge cases include broad works where attitudes are only one section (partially relevant), historical or DDR-era studies that assess ideological attitudes (relevant), and prescriptive or propagandistic texts lacking empirical assessment of attitudes (borderline to non-relevant).
23986	ungleichheit	The user seeks a comprehensive overview of social inequality—its definitions, dimensions, and perceived (in)justice—and how its forms and levels have changed over time, especially in Germany and Europe. They want evidence on causes and consequences across income, education, health, environment, and labor markets (including ethnic and regional differences), along with relevant sociological theories and survey findings.	A document is relevant to the query “ungleichheit” when it explicitly analyzes inequality—especially social inequality—such as income gaps, class and stratification, educational disparities by gender or region, ethnic disadvantage, or health inequalities, and may reference empirical sources or theories (e.g., ALLBUS surveys, Marx/Weber, environmental justice, climate and inequality links). Discussions that define the term, trace changes over time (East/West Germany, Austria), or examine causes, consequences, and public perceptions of inequality are also highly relevant. Theoretical or methodological pieces that debate how to conceptualize or measure Ungleichheit (e.g., opportunity vs. outcome, new dimensions of inequality) count if inequality is the central analytic focus. A document is non-relevant if “Ungleichheit” appears only in passing, is used in a different sense (mathematical inequalities, product “unevenness,” “Ungleichgewicht”), or focuses solely on “Gleichheit” without analyzing disparities. Edge cases include texts using synonyms or compounds (Einkommensungleichheit, gesundheitliche Ungleichheit), or linking inequality to climate and environment; these are relevant if they ultimately examine unequal distributions of resources, power, prestige, education, or health.
24946	umweltschutz	The user seeks a comprehensive overview of environmental protection that links policy, economics, and society, comparing integrated versus end-of-pipe strategies and assessing economic/labor impacts. Focus is on Germany/Europe with global context, including the roles of government, NGOs, and institutions like the WTO, public attitudes and psychology, and debates such as environmental justice.	A document is relevant to the query “umweltschutz” when it substantively addresses environmental protection—such as policies, legal frameworks, technologies (e.g., production-integrated approaches versus end-of-pipe), governance, or the economic significance of the environmental sector. Analyses of energy policy trade-offs (security, cost, environment), the role of international bodies like the WTO in fisheries subsidies or green goods liberalization, or discussions of carbon markets and Green New Deal strategies are clearly relevant, as are overviews of environmental management and consulting. Critiques and sociological studies of environmental NGOs and movements, environmental justice debates about the distribution of environmental burdens and benefits, or environmental psychology guidance for fostering pro-environmental behavior also qualify if they illuminate how environmental protection is organized, implemented, or motivated. Edge cases include mixed-focus items (e.g., “Arbeits- und Umweltschutz” in universities) which are relevant only if they provide meaningful content on environmental protection rather than mainly occupational safety, and “Naturschutz” pieces that are framed as part of broader Umweltschutz. Non-relevant are texts that merely name the term without analysis, purely promotional membership or fundraising content lacking environmental substance, or uses of “Schutz” in unrelated domains (e.g., data or personal protection).
2500	violence	The user is seeking scholarly resources that theorize and define violence from a sociological perspective—beyond causes to processes, typologies, and “violence regimes.” They also want empirical measures and findings on gender-based/domestic, symbolic, digital, political, and school violence, including intersectional analyses, welfare-state comparisons, media representations, and EU prevalence data.	A document is relevant to the query “violence” if it directly examines violence as a phenomenon—its definitions, processes, causes, consequences, prevalence, or typologies—and may use related terms like domestic/intimate partner violence, gender-based violence, school or political violence, digital violence, or structural/symbolic violence. Empirical studies that measure or describe violence through surveys, indices, case studies, video data analysis, or interviews (for example, an EU survey of gender-based violence, a Violence Regimes Index, or analyses of status-violence norms in schools and TV news depictions) are strongly relevant, as are works on dynamics such as escalation, temporal sequences, emotions, the body, and institutionalization. Conceptual debates about what counts as violence (narrow physical versus broader structural/cultural; symbolic or epistemic violence) are relevant when grounded in sociological frameworks or linked to policy, prevention, or intervention. Documents are less relevant if they only mention “violence” in passing, use it purely as a rhetorical flourish, or discuss adjacent topics (e.g., welfare regimes, ICTs, democratization) without tying them to violent practices or outcomes, or if they list incidents without analysis. Edge cases include pieces centered on harassment or psychological abuse that avoid the word “violence” yet frame the harms as violent (relevant), whereas work on “non-violence” or purely metaphorical “epistemic violence” may be off-target unless explicitly connected to concrete violent practices or regimes.
2585	kriminalität	The user seeks a comprehensive overview of crime as a social phenomenon, including how it is measured (objective vs. subjective), explained, and trends across societies. They also want insights into media discourse and public perception, demographic patterns (e.g., migrants, gender, youth), and implications for prevention and criminal justice policy.	A document is relevant if it substantively discusses crime (Kriminalität) as a social, legal, cultural, or statistical phenomenon—such as crime rates and trends, victimization, policing and sanctions, public fear versus perceived safety, or criminological theory. Strong examples include analyses contrasting police statistics with subjective insecurity, media studies of crime reporting, research on youth or migrant crime, gender differences in offending, or historical/cross-national time series of offenses and punishment. Work on prevention policy, labeling theory, or the social construction of crime discourse also qualifies; even cultural pieces (e.g., on Gangsta Rap or everyday moral storytelling) are relevant when they examine representations of crime and their social effects. Non-relevant are texts where the term appears only in passing, is used metaphorically, or materials about crime fiction entertainment unless they critically analyze crime as a social issue. Edge cases include papers focused on public security or inequality without repeatedly saying “Kriminalität” but clearly centered on criminal behavior (relevant), and methodological studies that test survey reliability about crime (relevant if crime is the primary application, not if it’s incidental).
26363	verkehrsmittel	Information on transport modes (Verkehrsmittel), especially public transport and multimodal options, focusing on factors that influence mode choice and how policies and technologies shape usage. Seeks research and data on commuting and travel behavior, accessibility, environmental impacts, and interventions that promote shifts to more sustainable modes.	A document is relevant to the query “verkehrsmittel” when it substantively discusses modes of transport (e.g., train, bus, car, bicycle) or the choice and use of these modes, such as studies on commuting by rail, multimodal travel habits, or factors influencing mode choice (like the planned behavior study comparing car, bike, and bus). Empirical work, policy analyses, or evaluations that focus on public transport access, tickets (e.g., a Semesterticket), mobility management, or urban transport integration also count as relevant, even if they don’t repeat the keyword but use domain terms like ÖPNV, sharing services, or cycling infrastructure. Lists and surveys that provide data or sections specifically about “Verkehrsmittel” (e.g., vacation travel reports with transport-mode breakdowns) are relevant, while documents that only mention the term in passing without analysis or data are weakly relevant. Historical or educational contexts are relevant if they describe the role or selection of transport modes (e.g., school traffic education or the emergence of new urban transport systems), but travel pieces focused solely on destinations or motives without any transport-mode information would be non-relevant. Edge cases include documents using synonyms or specific vehicle types without the keyword (still relevant) and legal or environmental texts: they are relevant only when they explicitly address transport modes or their regulation, not when they discuss climate or rights in general terms.
2662	politische orientierung	The user seeks information on political orientation—its definition, formation, and measurement—drawing on empirical studies in Germany, especially among youth. They want to know which social, moral, educational, religious, media, and cultural factors shape these orientations and how they influence democratic attitudes and participation.	A document is relevant if it defines, measures, or explains political orientations—attitudes, values, and positions toward politics and institutions—such as authoritarianism, nationalism, left–right self-placement, democratic values, or participation, especially when grounded in empirical data (e.g., ALLBUS, World Values Survey) or tied to political socialization. Studies on specific populations or contexts—youth in East/West Germany, children’s early political understanding, confessional ties, local democracy in a city like Mannheim, or cross-national comparisons in Eastern Europe—are directly on-topic when they analyze determinants and patterns of citizens’ orientations. Works that discuss “moralische Orientierungen” are relevant only if they connect these moral frames to citizens’ political orientations or their incorporation into decision processes; purely normative theory without such linkage is marginal. Items focused on institutional rules, higher-education policy designs, or organizational reforms are non-relevant if “Orientierung” refers to policy frameworks rather than people’s political attitudes. Clear relevance signals include terms like Einstellungen, Werte, politische Kultur, Links–Rechts, Autoritarismus, Toleranz, Partizipation, and analyses of media or youth culture shaping political orientations; non-relevant edge cases include “Orientierung” as general guidance, navigation, or unrelated domains (e.g., study orientation sessions, sexual orientation).
26823	technology	The user seeks an academic overview of technology as a sociotechnical phenomenon—covering philosophies and sociology of technology, measurement and indicators (e.g., technological sovereignty, readiness), diffusion and transfer, and cultural and gender dimensions. They likely want frameworks and evidence to guide technology decision-making, assessment, and policy across education, industry, and national contexts.	For the query “technology,” a document is relevant when technology itself is the central object of analysis—its development, governance, measurement, transfer, or social impacts—whether theoretical (e.g., philosophy of technology, constructivist accounts) or applied (e.g., technological sovereignty metrics, technology transfer models, readiness assessment tools). Examples that qualify include studies of K–12 technology leadership philosophies, algorithms for measuring technological independence, economics of technology and diffusion across generations, feminist technology studies, AI’s co-evolution with society, and care-sensitive technology assessment, because they interrogate technological artifacts, practices, or decision-making. Documents are non-relevant when “technology” appears only tangentially (such as in institutional names or passing references) or when the core topic is unrelated (e.g., general policy or culture pieces) without substantive analysis of technologies themselves. Edge cases—like culturally focused analyses, advertising “mood” technologies, or historical accounts of protectionism—are relevant if they examine technological mechanisms, metrics, or design implications; otherwise they are borderline. Signals of higher relevance include “technology/technological/tech/AI/ICT/innovation” in the title or abstract and sustained discussion where technology is central rather than incidental.
2741	sport	The user seeks an overview of scholarly and policy perspectives on sport as a social and economic institution, including management and marketing, commercialization and governance/legal frameworks, inclusion and gender equity, youth development, media representation, nationalism, and sport tourism. They want evidence on participation determinants, program sustainability, and European policy initiatives (EU, Council of Europe) related to sport and physical activity.	A document is relevant to the query “sport” if it substantively discusses athletic activities or the sports sector—such as sports management and marketing, governance and policy (e.g., EU White Paper on Sport), participation and inclusion (women in sport, disability sport), facilities and coaching, media and journalism, or social impacts like nationalism and health. Empirical studies, case reports, or reviews about sports organizations, funding models, event tourism, safeguarding, or the effects of sporting success all count as relevant, even when the focus is administrative or sociological rather than on gameplay. Documents are non-relevant when “sport” appears only as a homograph or substring (to sport a jacket, plant “sport” in biology, SPORT as an unrelated acronym, or words like transport/support/passport), or when it refers to non-athletic “sport mode” in cars or fashion labels. Edge cases include esports (often treated as relevant if framed within sport governance or participation), motorsport (relevant as an athletic domain), and media about a newspaper named “Sport,” which is relevant only if the content pertains to sports coverage rather than corporate matters.
2817	populismus	The user seeks academic analyses of populism—its historical roots, definitions and typologies, communicative strategies, and impacts on representation, participation, and liberal democracy. They also want comparative case studies across Europe, Russia, and the Americas and normative debates on whether populism threatens or revitalizes democracy.	A document is relevant if it explicitly analyzes Populismus as a political concept, for example by defining it, tracing its historical roots, outlining typologies, or debating its relationship to democracy, such as in discussions of Müller vs. Mudde/Kaltwasser or Rosanvallon/Lefort/Laclau/Mouffe. Case studies that situate populism in concrete contexts—e.g., AfD/PEGIDA, FPÖ/Haider, Le Pen, Berlusconi, Latin American movements, or Russia’s use of anti-populist repression and comparisons with Putin/Trump—are clearly relevant, as are works on populist communication (people vs. elites, exclusion of minorities), fake news classifications, and media logic (personalization, emotionalization). Empirical studies using surveys (e.g., ALLBUS), network analyses of misinformation, or research on determinants like recognition, political knowledge, or post-democratic mediatization also count as relevant. Non-relevant items are those that only name “Populismus” in passing, use the term as a loose insult or stylistic label without conceptual treatment, or focus on other ideologies without linking them to populism’s logic and effects. Edge cases include broad democracy or totalitarianism essays that mention populism only as a foil, or historical notes (e.g., invoking Abraham Lincoln) that are relevant only if they tie back to the modern concept and its mechanisms.
28540	worklife balance	The user seeks an overview of work-life balance concepts and drivers, along with research on organizational programs, their benefits, and challenges across different demographics. They also want practical policies and strategies—at both workplace and policy levels—to improve balance amid aging workforces, gender equity concerns, and economic pressures.	A document is relevant if it directly discusses work-life (or work–family) balance—its drivers, programs, outcomes, and policies—such as analyses of organizational WLB initiatives during economic downturns, gendered experiences of balancing roles in academia, expatriate WLB in GCC countries, or critiques of Italian and European WLB practices and policy. Empirical or theoretical work that explicitly links job demands to family/personal life, measures WLB, or proposes models and tools (e.g., flexible schedules, care services, support networks) also fits, even if phrased as work life, work-life, or work–family balance. Content that addresses “worklife” broadly—aging at work, quality of European worklife, or call-center “areas of worklife”—is only marginally relevant unless it ties those themes to balancing work with nonwork domains. Uses of “balance” in unrelated senses (e.g., physical balance in soccer, constitutional balancing tests, current account balances, or balance of power in IR) are non-relevant despite keyword overlap. Edge cases include health and leisure studies; they are relevant when framed as mechanisms to improve WLB, but not when they report health or fitness outcomes without reference to balancing work and life.
28676	worklife	The user is seeking research-based insights on worklife, especially how aging demographics and policy shape workplace management, employment quality, and worker engagement. They want evidence and recommendations on EU age policies, age management practices, demographic differences in engagement, and social risk management for career transitions.	A document is relevant to the query “worklife” if it substantively discusses working life, work-life balance/quality, or “areas of worklife” (e.g., management practices, aging at work, engagement, fairness, workload, control, community, values), even when using variants like “work life,” “work-life,” or non-English equivalents such as German “Arbeitsleben.” For example, chapters analyzing European worklife and age management, or studies of call center agents’ work engagement linked to areas of worklife, directly match the query. Documents addressing policies and risks across the life course of employment (e.g., transitional labor markets or “worklife insurance”) are also relevant because they center on conditions and transitions in working life. By contrast, texts that only mention “worklife” in passing, use it metaphorically, or focus solely on unrelated biographical methods without connecting to working conditions or employment contexts are non-relevant. Edge cases include branded terms like “WorkLife” (a program name), duplicate abstracts, or content in other languages; these can still be relevant if the substance concerns working life rather than a namesake or fleeting mention.
2884	fremdenfeindlichkeit	The user is seeking a research-based overview of xenophobia (Fremdenfeindlichkeit) in Germany, including its prevalence and East–West differences, key drivers (relative deprivation, education, family dynamics, social integration/identity), and how it is measured in surveys like ALLBUS. They also want evidence on trends and effective prevention or policy responses at community and national levels.	A document is relevant if it focuses on Fremdenfeindlichkeit (xenophobia) or close synonyms (e.g., Ausländerfeindlichkeit) by analyzing attitudes, behaviors, or crimes against foreigners, especially with empirical measures, determinants, or trends (e.g., ALLBUS-based studies, East–West differences, effects of education, deprivation, or intergroup contact). Also relevant are works that explicitly link xenophobia to related constructs or contexts—such as antisemitism, nationalism/patriotism, youth and family dynamics, or community prevention—when they test or discuss causal pathways, interventions, or policy programs (e.g., EUMC reports, XENOS/EQUAL) in relation to xenophobic outcomes. Broad reports on racism or discrimination qualify only if they contain dedicated sections quantifying or explaining xenophobia in Germany or the EU and make that linkage explicit. Non-relevant are documents on general crime, youth violence, or social policy that do not measure, compare, or discuss xenophobia, as well as identity or migration pieces that omit xenophobic attitudes or incidents. Edge cases include incidental or metaphorical uses of the term and purely historical overviews without analytical content (exclude), while studies of right-wing extremism or group-focused enmity (GMF) are included only when they directly assess xenophobic attitudes, behaviors, or their predictors.
2911	happiness	The user seeks research-based insights on how happiness (subjective well-being) is defined and measured, its key determinants, and how it varies across countries and over time. They want evidence on the roles of economic conditions, health, relationships, and public policies (including inequality and recall bias effects) and the implications for policy and population health.	A document is relevant if it directly analyzes happiness or subjective well-being, including its measurement, determinants, trends, or policy uses—such as cross-national surveys, the World Happiness Report, or findings linking happiness to factors like marriage, income, health, unemployment, and inequality. Content discussing methodological issues (e.g., recall bias in “happiness five years ago,” distinctions between experienced utility and decision utility, or differences between happiness and life satisfaction) is also relevant because it shapes how happiness data are interpreted. Studies of specific groups or settings—parents vs. nonparents, people living with HIV, workplace happiness, or regional/cultural variations—are relevant when they explicitly connect results to happiness or life satisfaction. By contrast, pieces that use “happiness” only as a metaphor, a brand/title, or that focus solely on other outcomes (health, income, economics) without linking them to happiness are non-relevant. Edge cases include documents centered on “well-being,” “life satisfaction,” or “subjective well-being” without the exact keyword; these can be relevant if they clearly operationalize or compare happiness constructs, while work on inequality or the economy is relevant only when tied to levels or distributions of happiness.
29207	zufriedenheit ausbildung	The user is seeking research and data on satisfaction with vocational education and training/apprenticeships, especially within Germany’s dual system. They want to understand satisfaction levels, key determinants (e.g., training quality, instructors, learning environment), and how satisfaction relates to transition into employment and career outcomes.	A document is relevant if it examines satisfaction (Zufriedenheit) with vocational training/apprenticeships (Ausbildung), including global satisfaction and specific determinants such as instructor quality, learning venues (school vs company), methods, content, working conditions, or perceived usefulness of the training during or after the program. It remains relevant when it analyzes the transition from Ausbildung into employment and explicitly assesses satisfaction with the training or with vocational schools, or compares dual and school-based pathways. Documents are non-relevant if they focus on satisfaction in unrelated domains (e.g., democracy, marriage, general life satisfaction) or on job satisfaction without linking it to the training experience, even if “Ausbildung” is mentioned. Edge cases include tertiary or profession-specific “Ausbildung” (e.g., psychologists, teachers) or historical DDR cohorts—these are relevant only if they measure satisfaction with the training itself; studies where satisfaction is a small subsection are borderline but acceptable if they report concrete satisfaction indicators. Methodological notes or labor-market outcomes (income, status) without a satisfaction component should be treated as non-relevant.
29262	zufriedenheit arbeit	The user is looking for survey-based insights on “satisfaction with work” in Germany, including public satisfaction with the work of the federal government and chancellor across policy areas and years, as well as research on job and working-condition satisfaction among different groups, plus outlooks and priority issues for the coming year.	The query “zufriedenheit arbeit” most naturally targets job satisfaction—people’s satisfaction with their work, working conditions, employment terms, or workplace relationships. Documents are relevant when they measure or discuss Arbeitszufriedenheit or closely related constructs such as satisfaction with Arbeitsbedingungen, Betreuung/Supervision, Bezahlung, Work-life balance, or colleagues, for example surveys of DDR youths on work and living conditions, studies of early-career academics’ satisfaction with employment conditions and supervision, apprentices’ training satisfaction, or police studies that include satisfaction with colleagues. Studies that assess satisfaction with one’s “Beruf” or explicitly separate the work component within “Arbeits- und Lebensbedingungen” (including links to migration intentions or effects of performance appraisal on satisfaction) also fit. By contrast, items about “Zufriedenheit mit der Arbeit der Bundesregierung” or satisfaction with democracy/political developments are non-relevant, as are uses of “Arbeit” meaning “this paper/work” rather than employment, or pieces focused only on general life or leisure satisfaction without a work component. Edge cases include mixed-topic studies where work satisfaction is a minor variable (still weakly relevant) and lists of policy areas like Arbeitsmarktpolitik that mention “Arbeit” but do not measure job satisfaction (non-relevant).
29421	zufriedenheit	The user is seeking empirical research and survey evidence on satisfaction (Zufriedenheit) across life, work, health, and political domains—primarily in Germany (and Poland)—including trends over time, regional differences, and key individual and economic determinants. They want to understand which factors (e.g., family, perceived control, education, employment conditions, and government performance) drive overall and domain-specific satisfaction and how this links to support for democracy.	The most relevant documents explicitly analyze “Zufriedenheit” (satisfaction) as a core concept—ideally in German—and report concrete measures, determinants, or trends across domains such as life, democracy, health, and work (e.g., studies using ALLBUS, SOEP, or BIBB/IAB on Lebens- oder Demokratiezufriedenheit). Content that uses compound forms or close variants—Lebenszufriedenheit, Berufszufriedenheit, Demokratiezufriedenheit, Kundenzufriedenheit, and even Unzufriedenheit—and provides findings like East–West regional gaps, family influences, perceived control, or economic effects is clearly relevant. Documents are less relevant when the word appears only in passing, in boilerplate topic lists, or as a casual adjective (“wir sind zufrieden”) without definitions, scales, hypotheses, or empirical results. Related terms such as Glück or Wohlbefinden can still qualify if they explicitly link to satisfaction measures or outcomes; otherwise, well-being pieces that never mention Zufriedenheit are borderline. Edge cases include multilingual texts where “zufriedenheit” appears only in a citation, typos or casing variants, or policy newsletters that mention satisfaction in a headline but provide no substantive analysis—these should be ranked below studies that model satisfaction, report survey results, or compare groups.
2945	life satisfaction	The query seeks research-based insights into what drives life satisfaction, examining how personal, social, economic, environmental, and policy factors (e.g., materialism, commuting, family/partnership, SES, migration, economic freedom, austerity) relate to it. It emphasizes cross-national (especially European) evidence, mediators/moderators, and domain-specific links to inform measurement and policy.	A document is relevant if it directly measures, defines, or analyzes overall life satisfaction (subjective well-being), typically via survey items or scales (e.g., Eurobarometer, SWLS) and reports determinants, correlates, or outcomes tied to it. Studies examining how factors such as materialism, commuting time satisfaction, environmental quality, parenthood, migration, austerity, marital status, work values, economic freedom, or national events influence life satisfaction—using clear statistical links—are strongly relevant. Research focused on domain-specific satisfaction (job, family, travel) is relevant only when it explicitly connects those domains to overall life satisfaction; otherwise, it is peripheral. Works using “quality of life,” “happiness,” or “well-being” are relevant if they operationalize or report life satisfaction specifically, whereas pieces on customer/product satisfaction, life expectancy, or macro indicators without a life-satisfaction measure are non-relevant. Edge cases include brief mentions without analysis (weak relevance) and aggregate regional/country studies, which remain relevant if they analyze life satisfaction as the construct of interest.
30368	work	The user seeks a synthesis of research on how work conditions and arrangements—such as stress, work environment, remote/telework, flexible hours, and atypical employment—affect employee motivation, performance, wellbeing, and work–family conflict. They also want cross-national and gender-specific insights (e.g., mothers’ working time patterns, fathers’ conflicts) and how family policies moderate these effects.	For a broad query like “work,” the most relevant documents discuss employment or labor topics such as job conditions, working hours, remote/telework, work stress, work–family conflict, or policies and environments that shape employee performance and well-being. Empirical studies with clear measures and samples (e.g., Likert-scale surveys, SEM/PLS analyses, national panels) that examine outcomes for workers—like research on nurses’ work stress or the effects of working from home on conflict—are strong matches. Uses of “work” in other senses (e.g., coursework/homework guidelines, “social work” syllabi, or the verb “it works”) are weakly relevant unless they directly address paid work or the social work occupation as labor. Edge cases include theoretical or cross-national analyses of labor income or working-time patterns, which are relevant, versus physics “work,” “artwork,” or casual verb uses, which are not. Documents that only mention the word “work” in passing or as boilerplate without substantive discussion of labor/employment should be treated as non-relevant.
31054	schule	The user is seeking comprehensive, research-based information about schools, particularly in German-speaking contexts. Topics include school violence (by students and teachers), inclusion of migrant and special-needs students, student–teacher relationships, school climate and governance, family–school dynamics, student participation, and broader social and environmental roles of schools.	A document is relevant if it primarily addresses the institution of school (Schule), such as empirical research on school violence and bullying, teacher–student relationships, inclusion of newly arrived or special-needs students, school climate and governance, or practical school initiatives (e.g., climate-neutral operations or arts education). Comparative studies of students’ and teachers’ perceptions, analyses of class- and school-level determinants of behavior, and discussions of parental roles or student participation also count as relevant because they center on schooling. By contrast, texts that use “Schule” to denote intellectual traditions (e.g., Frankfurter Schule, Chicago Schule) without discussing educational institutions, or that include the term only incidentally (in a citation, affiliation, or keyword list), are non-relevant. Edge cases include compounds like Schüler, Schulklima, Schulträger—which are relevant when the core topic is schooling—and metaphorical uses (e.g., Schule des Lebens) or unrelated senses of “school,” which are not. While the German term aligns best with German-language content, documents in other languages can still be relevant if their main focus is schools and schooling.
3107	drugs	The user seeks research-based information on drugs, emphasizing policy, pricing, prescribing, prevention, and enforcement across countries. They want to understand how patents, decriminalization/harm reduction, media campaigns, and healthcare practices affect drug prices, use patterns, health outcomes, and crime.	A document is relevant if it substantially discusses drugs as substances—medical or illicit—including their pricing, prescribing, use/abuse, treatment, regulation, or social and policy impacts; synonyms like medicines, pharmaceuticals, narcotics, and controlled substances also signal relevance. Examples include studies of HIV/AIDS drug prices in developing countries, analyses of national drug policies and harm reduction, research on GPs modifying hospital-prescribed medications, evaluations of anti-drug media campaigns, and case studies of addiction or drug-related crime. It remains relevant in technical contexts such as drug discovery, delivery systems, or decriminalization and treatment program evaluations, and in areas like sports doping or antibiotic/drug resistance where drugs are central to the topic. A document is non-relevant when “drug(s)” appears only tangentially (e.g., a company name, a passing metaphor, or general healthcare administration with no drug-focused content) or when the focus is retail logistics of “drug stores” without discussing the drugs themselves. Edge cases include pieces where “drug” is used as a verb in crime reports (often still relevant), articles centered on broader public health with only incidental drug mentions (weakly relevant), or policy texts where drugs are one of many minor examples (borderline).
31126	schichtarbeit	Find research and statistics on shift work, focusing on its health and social consequences (e.g., work–life balance and psychosomatic complaints), who is affected, and which organizational or policy measures can mitigate negative effects, particularly in the German/EU context.	A document is relevant if it primarily examines Schichtarbeit (shift work) itself—its schedules (e.g., two-shift, multi-shift), prevalence in sectors, and especially its impacts on health, work-life balance, and social life. Strong signals include empirical analyses (e.g., mediation analyses linking shift work to psychosomatic complaints), sectoral or regional studies (production plants, police), and references to recognized data sources like the BIBB/BAuA Erwerbstätigenbefragung, EU ad hoc labour modules, or the Mikrozensus, as well as related terms such as Schichtdienst or Mehrschichtarbeit. Documents discussing organizational or legal frameworks for shift work, mitigation measures, or team dynamics/solidarity under shift regimes are also relevant. Non-relevant items are those that mention “Schichtarbeit” only in passing (e.g., as one item in a long list of labor conditions or legal topics) or use “shift” in an unrelated sense (a shift in policy), without substantive analysis of shift work. Edge cases include historical DDR youth studies or male-dominated industry articles: they are relevant if shift work is a core focus, while texts about flexible hours or night work alone are borderline unless clearly embedded in a shift system.
3125	arbeitslosigkeit	The user seeks a comprehensive, research-based overview of unemployment, focusing on trends and distribution by demographics and qualifications, long-term and youth unemployment, and labor market flows in Germany and the EU. They also want evidence on consequences for health, life expectancy, families and marriages, youth outcomes, and the effectiveness of labor market policies.	A document is relevant to the query “arbeitslosigkeit” when it primarily analyzes, describes, measures, or theorizes unemployment (including synonyms like Erwerbslosigkeit) such as rates, duration, determinants, subgroup patterns (youth, long-term, qualification-specific), or policy responses. Examples of clearly relevant content include studies of unemployment flows and transitions, effects on health and life expectancy, impacts on families and marital stability, evaluations of labor-market measures affecting exits from unemployment, or discussions of benefit receipt (Arbeitslosengeld, Grundsicherung) tied to unemployed populations. Adjacent topics are still relevant if they explicitly link to unemployment—for instance, research on sickness and unemployment credits in pension data, the role of macroeconomic cycles in unemployment risk, or transitions between unemployment, education, inactivity, and self-employment. Non-relevant documents are those that only mention the term in passing, focus on different concepts (e.g., Arbeitsunfähigkeit/sickness absence or general employment) without an unemployment angle, or use “unemployment” metaphorically without empirical or conceptual treatment. Edge cases include underemployment, early retirement, or regional labor dynamics—these are relevant when framed as causes, consequences, or flows to/from unemployment, but marginal if the unemployment component is incidental or unquantified.
3147	antisemitismus	The user seeks a scholarly overview of antisemitism—its definitions, theories, and typologies across history and today (e.g., anti-Judaism, racial, secondary/Israel-related, Islamist; left- and right-wing forms). They are especially interested in debates about a “new antisemitism,” how to distinguish legitimate criticism of Israel from antisemitism, and empirical trends and case studies in Europe (notably Germany and Austria).	A document is relevant if it substantively defines, analyzes, or documents antisemitism—its concepts, theories, historical forms, and contemporary variants (e.g., traditional, secondary, left-wing, islamist, or Israel-related antisemitism), including empirical surveys or case studies. Texts that probe the boundary between legitimate criticism of Israeli government policy, anti-Zionism, and antisemitism, or that debate “old vs. new antisemitism,” count as relevant even when they use related terms like Israel-feindlichkeit and focus on methods such as hermeneutic or sequence analysis. Region- or milieu-specific investigations (Austria, Germany, France, Iran), discussions of Catholic or political antisemitism, and EU/OSCE policy debates are also relevant if they tie clearly to antisemitic semantics, attitudes, or structures. By contrast, documents that only mention the word in passing, treat prejudice in general without linking it to antisemitism, or use “Semitic” solely in linguistic/anthropological contexts are non-relevant. Edge cases include Holocaust or Middle East coverage and polemics: these are relevant only when they explicitly conceptualize or measure antisemitism (e.g., transferring classic stereotypes to Israel, “everyday” or “democratic” antisemitism) rather than merely narrating events or policy disputes.
3148	health	The user seeks an evidence-based overview of health from a population and policy perspective, including health care system organization and financing, public health law, and the role of health and digital health literacy. They also want to understand how reforms and economic development influence access to care, health behaviors, and disparities in health outcomes.	A document is relevant to the query “health” when it primarily examines human health, health care systems, public health policy, health literacy, or health behaviors and outcomes, such as studies of digital health literacy in Germany, analyses of Croatian health care reform, or evaluations of how privatization affects unmet health needs. Empirical work that measures health status (subjective or objective), investigates determinants of health (education, age, socioeconomic status), or explores health promotion and information seeking (e.g., internet health information and physician visits) is also clearly relevant. Legal, economic, or sociological analyses are relevant if they explicitly link their frameworks to population health, service provision, or health inequalities (for example, public health law foundations or the SARS-driven critique of China’s health system). By contrast, documents that use “health” only metaphorically (economic “health”), as a passing mention, or in non-human contexts (veterinary health), or that focus solely on survey methodology without a health application, would be non-relevant. Edge cases include broad policy or consumer behavior pieces: they count as relevant when health is the central domain (e.g., sexual health program concepts or health information seeking profiles), but not when health is incidental to a different primary topic.
31794	safety	The query seeks scholarly overviews of safety across multiple domains—traffic, schools, healthcare, energy, finance, and media—focusing on safety culture, policy and regulation, leadership, training, and public perceptions, including cross-national comparisons and their impact on outcomes.	A document is relevant if it directly examines safety as the prevention of harm or risk management in a concrete domain—such as road traffic safety, school safety, patient safety in healthcare, offshore petroleum safety, or journalist safety—including case studies of accidents, regulatory approaches, safety technologies, training, or safety culture and perceptions. Studies that operationalize safety as a construct (for example, psychological safety in workplaces or neighborhood safety for older adults) are also relevant when they analyze determinants, measurement, and interventions that affect safety outcomes. By contrast, pieces where “safety” refers primarily to economic or policy metaphors like the global financial safety net or debates on the social safety net are weakly relevant unless the user’s intent explicitly targets those policy frameworks. Edge cases include work where safety is a secondary pathway (e.g., leadership influencing innovation via psychological safety) or where “safety” appears only in passing or in instrument names without substantive discussion—these are marginal. Documents that merely mention “safe” rhetorically without analyzing risks, standards, or protective measures should be considered non-relevant.
32087	sexualität	The user seeks scholarly, interdisciplinary resources on sexuality conceptualized as a sociocultural and historical construct rather than a purely biological drive. They want coverage of gender and power (heteronormativity, feminist and queer theory), relationships and measurement, childhood development and education, media and pornography, prostitution, and sexualized violence, including implications for policy and professional practice.	A document is relevant when it engages substantively with Sexualität—its meanings, practices, measurement, regulation, or cultural representation—rather than merely mentioning the word. Clear examples include analyses of sexuality as a sociocultural category, validated measures of physical/affective attraction in partnerships, discussions of child and adolescent sexual development and education, or feminist/queer debates on heteronormativity, pornography, and sexualized violence. Works in media, religion, law, counseling, or social work are relevant if they examine how sexuality is constructed, negotiated, or governed within those domains. Non-relevant items are those where Sexualität appears only in passing (e.g., in a contents list or metadata) or where the focus is purely anatomical reproduction without linkage to human sexual behavior, identity, or meanings. Edge cases include compound terms (e.g., Heterosexualität, Sexualerziehung, sexualisierte Gewalt) or synonyms like “sex,” which are relevant if sexuality is central; content about minors is in-scope when developmental/educational, whereas explicit or merely sensational material would not align with the likely intent.
32407	sexual	The user seeks scholarly information on sexuality and sexual health, particularly how sexual pleasure and satisfaction relate to health outcomes and gender differences. They also want evidence on the prevalence, dynamics, and impacts of sexual harassment and violence in workplaces and higher education, and implications for policy and sexuality education.	A document is relevant if the term “sexual” is central to its topic, such as studies on sexual health and pleasure (e.g., GeSiD findings linking sexual pleasure to STI communication and condom use), sexual satisfaction across orientations and ages (e.g., DEAS results), or analyses of sexual harassment and violence in workplaces and universities. It is also relevant when “sexual” anchors theoretical or policy discussions, like the history and definitions of sexual health in public health or feminist critiques of sexualized power in organizations. Documents are less relevant if “sexual” appears only tangentially (e.g., a single passing mention, only in a citation or title in the references) or if the core focus is general health or organizational issues without substantive sexual content. Edge cases include language and morphology: non-English variants (e.g., German “sexuelle/sexualisierte”) and related forms (“sexuality,” “sexualized”) may or may not match the exact keyword depending on indexing, while compounds like “homosexual” or “asexual” might be missed by strict token matching. Another edge case is domain drift, where “sexual” in biological contexts (e.g., sexual dimorphism in animals) technically matches but is off-topic if the user intends human sexuality.
3247	political orientation	The user seeks scholarly research on how political and value orientations are conceptualized and measured and how they shape political behavior and attitudes—such as party choice, participation, trust, and views on issues like EU integration and immigration. They are interested in comparative evidence (especially Western vs. post-socialist Europe) and the role of conversational orientations in democratic engagement.	A document is relevant if it conceptualizes, measures, or analyzes political orientations (e.g., left–right, conservative–liberal, religious–secular, materialist–postmaterialist) and links them to political outcomes such as party choice, participation, political trust, or attitudes toward migrants or European integration. For example, comparative studies of West European value orientations and party families, analyses proposing a feminist political orientation, postsocialist tests of the left–right–anti-immigrant association, or survey-based factor models that extract higher-order ideological dimensions (like post-materialist orientation) directly address political orientation. Research that treats conversational or democratic value orientations as antecedents to engagement or trust also qualifies when it explicitly ties these orientations to citizens’ political stances and behaviors. Non-relevant are pieces where “orientation” means policy emphasis (investor- or region-oriented policies), disciplinary/thematic orientation of political science, or discussions of Orientalism (the Orient), and duplicated entries that add no new analysis. Edge cases include elite “orientational structure” histories or civic-culture narratives, which are relevant only if orientations are operationalized as political attitudes or ideology rather than used descriptively or metaphorically.
32738	sicherheit	The user is seeking academic literature on the concept of “security,” spanning inner/public, social, human, and IT security. They want definitions, critical frameworks, and German/European debates on security’s discursive construction and its relationship to freedom, migration, welfare policy, and resilience.	A document is relevant if it substantively engages the German concept of “Sicherheit” (security/safety), for example by analyzing inner/public security, societal or social security systems, security–freedom trade-offs, resilience, EU defense policy, migration and security, human security, or IT security. Pieces that define, historicize, compare, or critique security frameworks and discourses—such as societal security vs national security, the shift from repressive to preventive policing, critical security studies (Copenhagen/Paris/Aberystwyth), or the status and marketization of security—are strongly relevant. Texts on “soziale Sicherheit” (welfare, pensions) are relevant when they explicitly frame benefits as security regimes or rights; purely fiscal or administrative discussions with only incidental use of the term are less relevant. Non-relevant items include cases where “Sicherheit” appears only as an idiom (“mit Sicherheit” = certainly), a brand/proper noun, or as epistemic “certainty” without a safety/security context. Edge cases like Rechtssicherheit (legal certainty) or “Sicherheit” as social status count as relevant if they analyze the security concept or its societal effects, but not if the word is merely metaphorical or passing.
32820	selbstdarstellung	The user is seeking scholarly discussions of Selbstdarstellung (self-presentation/self-representation) across media, social, and political contexts, including reality TV, social networks, and national identity. The focus is on strategies, authenticity, audience reception, and the sociocultural conditions driving self-presentation in late modernity.	A document is relevant if it explicitly examines Selbstdarstellung (self-presentation) as a practice or concept—whether by individuals, groups, or states—and discusses its purposes, strategies, or reception. Clear examples include empirical or theoretical analyses of reality TV contestants managing impressions (e.g., Big Brother, ingratiation vs. self-promotion and perceived authenticity), photographic self-representations of youth on social media, online dating profile misrepresentation, talk show performance of privacy, or national self-presentation in foreign policy and identity management (e.g., post-reunification Germany, Switzerland, or political leaders’ image-building). Synonyms and close German terms such as Selbstinszenierung, Selbstrepräsentation, Präsentation des Selbst, or plural/compound variants (Selbstdarstellungen, kulturelle Selbstdarstellung, live posting) also signal relevance if the focus remains on how selves are staged and perceived. By contrast, documents are non-relevant when Selbstdarstellung is only a passing label, appears solely in metadata, or “Darstellung” refers to the depiction of non-self subjects without analyzing impression management or identity performance. Edge cases include metaphorical uses (e.g., institutional branding) that are still relevant if they analyze self-staging mechanisms and audience reception, and language variants (German vs. English “self-presentation”) that should be included if they address the same concept.
3294	haushaltseinkommen	The user seeks information on household income (Haushaltseinkommen) in Germany—its definition, measurement, distribution, and key determinants. They likely want evidence on trends and inequality and how household income interacts with taxes, pensions, employment status, and living standards.	A document is relevant if it directly analyzes household income—its level, distribution, determinants, or policy impacts—or uses it as a core variable (e.g., tax progression on household income, EVS/SOEP studies of income mobility and inequality, COVID-19 shocks to household income, or couple-level contributions to household income). Studies that relate household income to outcomes such as nutrition, life satisfaction, or willingness to work in retirement, or that model burdens relative to disposable/net household income (e.g., VAT microsimulations), also count as relevant. Methodological pieces that define “private household,” discuss equivalized or per-capita measures, or compare “disposable” vs “gross” household income are relevant because they affect how household income is measured and interpreted. Documents are only partially relevant if household income appears merely as a control or background descriptor without substantive analysis. They are non-relevant if they focus solely on individual earnings/wealth or unrelated topics and mention household income only in passing, or if they analyze household wealth or expenditures without linking them to household income.
3297	schulische bildung	The query seeks research-based overviews of school education in Germany, with emphasis on the goals and practices of political education (including extremism prevention and socio-political approaches). It also looks for evidence on vocational preparation and reform, inclusion and education for sustainable development, and how family and migration backgrounds shape students’ outcomes and labor market risks.	A document is relevant to the query “schulische bildung” if it examines education within the school system (primarily primary and secondary) or school-based learning contexts, such as political education curricula, inclusion in schools, vocational schooling within the dual system, or family influences on students’ school trajectories. Examples include analyses of extremism prevention embedded in school political education in NRW, studies of how youths with migration background experience politics classes, integrations of Education for Sustainable Development into social-science subjects, or evaluations of school-based internships and career orientation. It is also relevant when theoretical or empirical work is explicitly tied to school institutions (e.g., applying Bourdieu’s concepts to schooling, PISA-driven reforms, or the impact of missing school/vocational certificates on labor-market risks). Non-relevant are pieces focused on higher education, adult or purely extracurricular education, company-only training without a school component, or general policy topics (e.g., urban transport or economic theory) that are not didactically linked to school teaching. Edge cases include articles on the “außer-schulische” social/education sector (only relevant if connected back to schools), or topical societal debates that are relevant when framed as content and methods for school political education but not when presented without any pedagogical link.
32984	security	The user seeks a concise synthesis of how “security” has evolved from a traditional, state–military concept to a multidimensional agenda encompassing human, climate, cyber, energy, economic, and health security, informed by critical security theories. They want comparative insights into regional policies and governance (e.g., Japan, China, ASEAN, Africa, Europe, UN), including case studies and policy options for integrating non-traditional security into national and international frameworks.	A document is relevant if it substantively analyzes security as a concept, policy domain, or set of threats, for example discussions of climate security in Japan, human security in China or ASEAN, or domain-specific areas like cyber, energy, economic, and intelligence-driven national security. Theoretical and analytical pieces that define or critique security (e.g., Copenhagen/Paris/Aberystwyth schools, security governance, Foucault’s security dispositive) are also relevant because they shape what “security” means and how it is practiced. Empirical case studies of institutions and regions—UN Security Council reform, SADC/ECOWAS responses to COVID-19, transatlantic security architectures, or systemic IT security illustrated by Mirai and WannaCry—clearly qualify, regardless of language, if they center on security policy, actors, and outcomes. By contrast, documents are non-relevant when “security” is incidental or refers to unrelated notions such as financial securities, job security, security deposits, or passing mentions without conceptual or policy analysis. Edge cases include historical treatments of “gute Policey” or comprehensive security that remain relevant if they trace the evolution of security practices, and technology or development pieces that are only relevant when they explicitly frame risks, governance, or protections as security issues rather than generic safety or management concerns.
3307	political participation	The user seeks an analytical overview of political participation—its forms, levels, and trends—across countries and generations, and how determinants like political knowledge, efficacy, income/inequality, social networks, workplace practices, and institutions shape engagement. They also want evidence on causal pathways (including familial/genetic confounds), differences between online and offline modes, and implications for theories and policies to boost participation.	A document is relevant if it directly analyzes, defines, measures, or explains political participation—such as voting, contacting officials, petitioning, protesting, campaigning, or online engagement—and its determinants (e.g., political interest, knowledge, efficacy, resources), consequences, or trends across groups or countries. Empirical studies using designs like discordant twins, cross-national surveys (e.g., CSES, ISSP, ALLBUS), or mediation models linking knowledge to efficacy to participation, as well as research on generational change, post-communist or Latin American contexts, inequality’s effects, workplace spillover, or social networks’ mobilization, are all clearly relevant. A document is non-relevant if “participation” refers to non-political domains without an explicit spillover to politics, or if it discusses democracy, institutions, or policy in general without analyzing political behavior or intentions to participate. Edge cases include theoretical pieces: they remain relevant if they specify mechanisms or classify forms of participation, while studies on knowledge, efficacy, or interest are only relevant when they explicitly connect these attitudes to participation. Similarly, work on civic education or social media that merely describes usage without linking it to turnout or political acts is borderline, whereas studies distinguishing conventional vs. unconventional, formal vs. informal, or online vs. offline participation are relevant.
33259	selbstwirksamkeit	The user seeks an overview of self-efficacy (Selbstwirksamkeit), including how it is defined and measured and its effects across domains like education, sports, climate action, well-being, and civic participation. They also want evidence on factors and interventions that strengthen self-efficacy and how it correlates with experience, support, and engagement.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses Selbstwirksamkeit (self-efficacy) as a construct—e.g., defines it, measures it with scales, analyzes its predictors or outcomes, or tests interventions that strengthen it. Clear examples include studies on Selbstwirksamkeitserwartung in specific domains (such as riders or horse‑assisted stress coaching), climate-education projects that raise klimabezogene Selbstwirksamkeit, political or career-choice self-efficacy in youth, or analyses of how computer games foster self-efficacy experiences. Partially relevant are pieces that use the concept to frame results (e.g., refugees navigating between self-efficacy and external control, community initiatives cultivating perceived agency) but do not operationalize or analyze it in depth. Non-relevant are texts that only discuss Wirksamkeit (effectiveness), empowerment, or agency without the “self-” construct, or that mention Selbstwirksamkeit only in passing without data, theory, or substantive discussion; likewise, adjacent notions (e.g., a generic “Beteiligungsselbstkonzept”) may be borderline if self-efficacy isn’t the focus. Edge cases to include are compound and domain-tagged variants like Selbstwirksamkeitserwartung, Selbstwirksamkeitserleben, politische/klimabezogene/berufswahlbezogene Selbstwirksamkeit, and instances with OCR or hyphenation artifacts.
33371	selbstverwirklichung	The user seeks an overview of “Selbstverwirklichung” (self-realization) as a social and philosophical concept, especially in modern work, examining its promises and risks—how autonomy and flexibility are mobilized by institutions and labor markets, sometimes producing self-exploitation or alienation. They likely want scholarly perspectives across sociology, philosophy, education, gender, and social policy, including historical context and critical theory debates.	A document is relevant if it substantively analyzes, defines, or empirically examines Selbstverwirklichung (self-realization), for example in work and employment (flexible hours, subjectivation of labor, HR practices), social policy (pensions or disability insurance shaping possibilities for self-fulfillment), education (as a pedagogical goal), psychology (humanistic or feminist theories), or philosophy (normative frameworks). Pieces that explore tensions—such as how quests for autonomy and authenticity can flip into self-alienation under market pressures, or how institutions instrumentalize self-realization for productivity—are strongly relevant. By contrast, texts that only mention the term in passing (e.g., a marketing blurb, a checklist of values, or a generic statement like “work offers self-realization”) without conceptual depth, evidence, or sustained discussion are weakly relevant or non-relevant; so are works about self-care or self-employment that never connect to self-realization. Edge cases include historical or biographical studies that focus on specific groups (e.g., unemployed academics, single parents, or thinkers like Karen Horney): they are relevant if they trace how self-realization is enabled, constrained, or redefined, but not if the term is merely a rhetorical aside. Depth of treatment—clear definitions, theoretical or normative argument, operationalization, and empirical findings—raises relevance, while metaphorical, incidental, or untranslated-synonym-free mentions lower it; English equivalents like “self-actualization” can also signal relevance.
3340	sex	The user is seeking scholarly, policy, and cross-national research on sex in society, including sex work, sexual violence and regulation, demographic patterns of same-sex couples, gender disparities, and public attitudes. They also need methodological studies on measuring sex and gender in surveys and health research and the impacts of data classification changes.	A document is relevant if it substantively engages the concept or term “sex,” whether as sexual activity (e.g., sex work, sexual violence, Sex Offences Act), demographic/biological categorization (e.g., sex ratio, sex differences), relationship categories (e.g., same-sex couples), or measurement/operationalization in research (e.g., sex assigned at birth vs. gender identity). Examples include studies of same-sex couple homogamy, UK policy on sex crimes, surveys of sex-based hygiene norms, or methodological notes on coding “sex” in census data. Compounds like “sexual,” “same-sex,” and technical usages such as “sex ratio” generally count, even if they are not about sexual behavior. By contrast, texts where “sex” appears only incidentally (author names, place names like “Essex,” a passing mention in a reference list, or non-English equivalents that don’t include the English token) are non-relevant to a literal keyword match. Edge cases include documents focused solely on “gender” without linking to sex, or items where “sex” appears only in metadata or acronyms; these are weaker matches than works whose central analysis hinges on sex.
33461	rechts links	The user is looking for research on the political meanings of “left” and “right” (links/rechts), how these concepts have evolved and are understood by different social groups, and how they function as heuristics for self- and party placement, especially in Germany. They seek survey-based analyses of associations, socio-structural influences, youth perceptions, and shifts in party positioning over time.	A document is relevant if it examines the political meanings of “links” and “rechts” in German, such as the Left–Right schema, self-placement scales, party positioning, or how citizens and elites semantically associate these labels across time. Highly relevant examples include empirical studies (e.g., ALLBUS, GLES) that analyze open-ended associations with correspondence analysis, compare cohorts or regions (Ost/West), or show how education, age, and party bloc shape interpretations, as well as work testing the heuristic value of the Left–Right dimension or proposing added dimensions (libertarian–authoritarian, ecological). Methodological pieces on scale layout effects (left-to-right vs right-to-left) or cross-national comparisons of Left–Right meanings also fit. Non-relevant are texts that use “rechts” and “links” purely as spatial/anatomical terms (handedness, traffic directions) or that discuss legal “Recht” without any link to political right/left. Edge cases include symbolic treatments of right vs left hands that become relevant only if explicitly tied to political ideology, and analyses claiming politics is “beyond left and right” that still evaluate the schema’s role.
3365	drogen	The user seeks an overview of drug use and policy, especially concerning youth: psychosocial drivers, prevalence trends, and prevention approaches. They also want comparative insights into decriminalization/legalization and harm-reduction models, alongside organized crime and trafficking dynamics across different countries.	A document is relevant if it substantively discusses drugs (Drogen) as substances of use or misuse, including consumption patterns, health and social effects, trafficking, policy, prevention, or harm-reduction. Examples of relevance include analyses of youth drug use and school-based prevention, debates on legalization or decriminalization (e.g., Portugal, Germany), methadone or controlled heroin access, epidemiology of specific substances (cannabis, heroin, cocaine, Captagon), and organized crime or smuggling through ports. Texts using compound terms and synonyms like Drogenkonsum, Drogenpolitik, Rauschgift, Betäubungsmittel, Sucht/Suchtprävention, or naming specific substances (including comparisons with alcohol and tobacco) are also relevant. Non-relevant items include metaphorical uses (“wie eine Droge”), unrelated chemistry or biomedical terms that merely contain the string (e.g., Hydrogen, Androgen), or clinical pharmacology about approved medicines without a social/illicit-use context, as well as pieces where “Drogen” is only mentioned in passing. Edge cases are broader governance or historical essays: they count as relevant if drugs are a central analytic thread, but general youth or crime studies lacking substantive drug-focused content should be treated as non-relevant.
34145	rechtsextremismus	The user is seeking an overview of right-wing extremism, including its definition and ideology, manifestations (parties, movements, youth scenes, media), and social drivers and electoral support in German-speaking contexts. They also want research-based responses and prevention strategies across education, policy, law enforcement, and civil society.	A document is relevant if it explicitly examines Rechtsextremismus as an ideology or phenomenon—e.g., defining it as anti-egalitarian, authoritarian, and anti-pluralist—and analyzes its actors, structures, and expressions. Strong signals include discussion of right-wing extremist parties and milieus (such as NPD, DVU, FPÖ), youth subcultures (skinheads, hooligans), media/music/Internet ecosystems, electoral dynamics, violent manifestations or right-wing terrorism, and psychological, social, or political explanations of causes and attitudes. Policy and pedagogy materials are also relevant when they focus on combating or framing Rechtsextremismus (government committees, mobile counseling, school curricula, local case studies, civil society strategies). Non-relevant items are those treating “extremism” or “racism” in general without a right-wing link, purely historical accounts of National Socialism without connection to contemporary right-wing extremism, or texts that only mention the term in passing; similarly, work on left-wing extremism or generic populism is irrelevant unless tied to right-wing extremist content. Edge cases include analyses of right-wing populism, “extremism of the center,” public discourse, or legal/administrative measures, which are relevant only if they explicitly connect to right-wing extremist ideas, networks, or outcomes rather than using the concept metaphorically or tangentially.
3420	left right	Find research on the left–right ideological scale in comparative politics, focusing on how its meaning varies across countries and respondents, its measurement validity, and its role in structuring policy preferences and voting. Emphasis on cross-national equivalence, dimensionality, and changing salience in party competition and public opinion.	A document is relevant if it analyzes the political left–right dimension, such as studies of left–right self-placement scales, construct equivalence across countries, voter or party positioning, or how income/education or policy preferences map onto “left” versus “right.” Content using close variants like “left–right,” “LR scale,” “ideological spectrum,” or explicit liberal–conservative mappings also counts, as do pieces on salience, validity, nonresponse to left–right probes, or cross-national comparability (e.g., whether the meaning of left/right differs in Japan vs. Scandinavia). It is non-relevant when “left” and “right” refer to spatial or anatomical directions, formatting/alignment, physics or biology (chirality), or any non-political usage, or when the terms appear only in passing without analyzing the ideological divide. Borderline cases include papers focused solely on “left populism” or “right populism” without situating them along a left–right axis, or work on “liberal–conservative” that lacks an explicit mapping to left–right; these are relevant only if they connect to the left–right schema. Methodological pieces evaluating the dimensionality or complexity of left–right perceptions, party shifts on economic vs cultural subdimensions, or variations in salience across contexts are strongly relevant even if the exact phrase “left right” is hyphenated or abbreviated.
3474	arbeitszeit	The user seeks research and policy insights on working time (Arbeitszeit) in Germany, including how normal, actual, and desired hours are measured and organized, the role of flexible schedules and collective agreements, and differences across groups. They want to understand impacts on job satisfaction, gender and family balance, and firm-level practices and outcomes.	A document is relevant if it centers on Arbeitszeit (working time) as a primary concept—e.g., analyzing its duration, measurement (normal, actual, desired hours), flexibility (shift schedules, time accounts, part-time), or its effects on satisfaction, family-work balance, or labor outcomes. Concrete examples include studies using time-use diaries to compare actual vs. normal hours, research on tariff or firm-level regulations that lengthen or shorten weekly hours, or analyses of fathers’ and mothers’ desired hours and the gap to contracted hours. Content focused on adjacent constructs like Betriebszeiten (operating hours), overtime, or flexible scheduling remains relevant when explicitly tied to individual working time levels or compliance with contracted hours. Non-relevant items are those that only mention Arbeitszeit in passing, discuss labor markets or wages without addressing hours, or focus solely on unrelated “time” (e.g., machine runtime or school schedules). Edge cases include methods-heavy papers (e.g., Tobit/Heckman/Double Hurdle) that are still relevant if Arbeitszeit is a dependent or key variable, and policy debates that are pertinent only when they substantively address changes to working hours rather than generic productivity or cost arguments.
34932	rightwing	The user is seeking scholarly analyses of right-wing politics and populism—their drivers (economic inequality, cultural anxiety, religiosity), rhetoric, and voter bases—across Europe and the U.S. They want evidence on electoral-system and media effects, strategic voting, trust and participation patterns, comparisons with technocracy and fascism, and implications for civil resistance.	A document is relevant if it explicitly discusses “rightwing/right-wing/right wing” politics—actors, parties, voters, ideologies, rhetoric, media, or movements—such as analyses of rightwing populism, rightwing extremism, electoral advantages for rightwing parties, or voter trust and participation patterns by rightwing identification. Examples include studies of civil resistance to rightwing populism, event-study evidence on Germany’s AfD, comparisons of rightwing populists versus technocratic leaders, or research on strategic voting that advantages rightwing parties in rural districts. It is non-relevant if “right wing” is used in a non-political sense (sports positions, aircraft wings, anatomy) or if the term appears only in passing without substantive treatment. Edge cases include documents using close synonyms (conservative, far-right) without the exact keyword, which may be topically relevant but not a strict keyword match, and hyphenation or spacing variants that should still count. Historical pieces on fascism are relevant when they directly link to rightwing rhetoric or populism; otherwise they may be peripheral.
36787	sustainability	The user seeks scholarly analyses on how sustainability is conceptualized and operationalized—covering normative frameworks, indicators, governance, and measurement—and how information, communication, and socio-demographic factors drive pro-sustainable behaviors. The focus spans multiple sectors (tourism, higher education, finance, corporate culture, and law), with emphasis on European contexts and alignment with the UN SDGs.	A document is relevant if it engages substantively with sustainability as a concept or practice across environmental, social, economic, or institutional pillars, including policy frameworks, governance, indicators/metrics, and behavior change. Examples of relevance include analyses of Agenda 21 or the SDGs, sectoral studies such as sustainable tourism using Eurobarometer data, university sustainability strategies, sustainability communication on social media, sustainable finance, or methods like ISO 37130, indicator selection, and balanced scorecards applied to sustainability performance. Work that treats the normative and analytical dimensions (e.g., Brundtland, social sustainability, intercultural understanding, or legal implementation of sustainability) is also relevant. Non-relevant items are those that only mention “sustainability” in passing, use the term in an unrelated sense (e.g., “sustainable competitive advantage” or mere financial viability) without environmental/social context, or discuss tourism/education/finance without any sustainability framing. Edge cases such as single-pillar studies, methodological pieces building sustainability indices or clusters, and critiques of governance or greenwashing remain relevant; duplicated content does not change relevance but may be down-weighted for redundancy.
37090	stress arbeit	The user is seeking information on work-related stress, including definitions, causes and typologies of workplace stressors, and their effects on employees and organizations. They likely want evidence-based assessment methods and practical interventions at individual and organizational levels to prevent and manage job stress.	A document is relevant if it discusses stress specifically in the context of work or employment, including occupational stress models, workplace conditions, organizational factors, labor policy, or occupational health (e.g., psychische Arbeitsbelastungen, Arbeitsschutzgesetz, Arbeitsorganisation, Entgrenzte Arbeit). Mentions of stress within the Arbeitswelt, specific professions (e.g., Sozialarbeit, IT sector), unions and workplace negotiations (e.g., IG Metall anti-stress measures), or emotions at work are strong signals, and compounds like Arbeitsstress, Arbeitsbelastung, or Arbeitswelt, as well as the old spelling Streß, should count. By contrast, texts focusing on stress in families, partnerships, or among students, or medical discussions of stress and heart disease without a workplace link, are non-relevant, as are uses of Arbeit meaning “study/paper” rather than employment. Edge cases include sociology or history pieces that connect organizational and task-related stress or analyze work culture; these are relevant even if “work” appears mainly in compounds or institutions. A document that mentions both terms only incidentally or far apart, with no substantive connection between stress and employment, should be treated as non-relevant.
38053	social status	The user seeks a synthesis of research on social status—especially subjective status—covering how it is defined and measured and the key determinants (education, occupation, income, mobility, inequality) across countries. They want to understand how status perceptions influence identity, political attitudes and behavior, media and cultural consumption, and outcomes like job satisfaction.	A document is relevant if it explicitly treats social status as a position in a social hierarchy—either subjective (e.g., ladder self-placement) or objective/proxy-based (education, occupation, income, prestige scales like EGP/ISEI/CAMSIS)—and examines its determinants, patterns, or consequences. Examples include ISSP-based analyses of subjective social status across countries and time, experiments that manipulate group status independent of power, studies of status inconsistency and mobility, links between perceived inequality/fairness and status, or domain-specific cases (e.g., aviation maintenance, migrant identities, media portrayals, leisure stratification) where status is central to the argument. Works that develop or harmonize measurement of occupation/prestige as indicators of status, or that trace how status shapes politics, identity, or well-being, also qualify. Non-relevant items use “status” in non-social senses (project/health/marital/device status) or discuss power/inequality without engaging status, prestige, or hierarchical placement. Edge cases: papers that decouple power from status to isolate status effects are relevant; pieces that only name-drop “status” without operationalizing or analyzing it are borderline.
38113	social mobility	The user seeks a concise, research-based overview of social mobility: how it is defined and measured (objective vs. subjective), its intergenerational patterns and determinants (education policy, skills, social capital), and its interaction with spatial/international migration. They also want evidence on consequences for health, life satisfaction, and political attitudes, with comparative cross-national findings.	A document is relevant if it examines social mobility as movement between social strata across generations or over the life course, including its determinants, consequences, or measurement. This includes empirical studies using class mobility models (e.g., diagonal reference models), percentile-based occupational status measures net of upgrading, analyses of subjective versus objective mobility and their links to health, life satisfaction, or political attitudes, and work that connects spatial/international migration to social positions through concepts like transnationalism, social capital, or intersectionality. Policy evaluations that affect status attainment (such as compulsory schooling reforms) and studies of academic or student mobility are relevant when they explicitly assess status gains or losses or inequality of opportunity. Non-relevant are pieces where “mobility” means political mobilization on social media, transport/sustainable mobility, or physical movement, unless they directly measure changes in social class or status. Edge cases include international student/researcher mobility or social capital studies—these are only relevant if they theorize or measure shifts in social position; null results on mobility effects remain relevant, while purely technical discussions without a clear link to social stratification may be marginal.
38133	sozial	The user seeks scholarly resources on the concept of the “social” in sociology and social work, including theory, history, and practice. They want analyses of social inequality, inclusion and health, welfare state policy (notably Austria), social movements (including right-wing activities), social capital, and the professionalization of social work.	A document is relevant if it uses the German term “sozial” or its inflected/derived forms centrally and substantively, for example in titles, headings, or abstracts discussing topics like soziale Ungleichheit, Soziale Arbeit, Sozialstaat, soziale Bewegungen, Sozialpolitik, or Sozialkapital. Compounds and derivatives that contain the root count as matches (e.g., Sozialarbeit, Sozialwissenschaften, sozialpolitisch, Sozialpsychologie, sozialräumlich), including hyphenated forms such as sozial-ökologisch and inflections like soziale/sozialer/sozialen/soziales. Documents are weakly relevant or non-relevant if “sozial” appears only incidentally (e.g., in a single citation, an author’s affiliation like Fakultät für Sozialwissenschaften, or as part of a proper name) while the main topic is unrelated. Edge cases include negated or contrary forms like asozial or antisozial (string match but opposite meaning), and OCR or line-break artifacts (sozi-al) that should still be treated as valid matches if they reconstruct to “sozial.” Content in English using only “social” is generally non-relevant for the exact keyword, unless it explicitly targets German terms or provides bilingual coverage where “sozial” is a focal keyword.
3856	generationen	The query seeks academic literature on the concept of generations, focusing on how generational identities are constructed and contested in media and social science and how they differ from birth cohorts. It looks for empirical studies on intergenerational relations, family lifespans, historical/political generations (e.g., 68ers, Generation Golf/Praktikum), and second-generation migrants in German-speaking contexts.	A document is relevant if it substantively discusses human generations as social or demographic cohorts, the construction of “Generationen” in media and scholarship, or relations between age groups (e.g., labels like Generation Golf or Generation Praktikum, Mannheim’s theory of generations, or studies of 68ers and their children). Analyses of intergenerational dynamics—such as family joint lifetimes in three- and four-generation households, the “Generationenvertrag” in pensions, parliamentary cohort turnover, or inequalities affecting the second generation of migrants—also qualify. Empirical and theoretical treatments that show how generations are constituted (through shared experiences, narratives, or mobilization) are especially pertinent, including DDR-specific cohort studies or narrative differences across generations. Non-relevant are uses of “generation” unrelated to human cohorts, such as power/electricity generation, “next‑generation” products/technologies, or generic mentions without analysis. Edge cases include purely genealogical or cohort-statistical pieces: these are relevant when tied to intergenerational interaction, identity, or inequality, but marginal if they only label birth cohorts without connecting them to generational meaning or structure.
3938	gender	The user seeks a comprehensive understanding of gender—distinguishing it from sex, examining identities, roles, and stereotypes, and how gender structures social life and inequality. They also want evidence and policy approaches (e.g., gender mainstreaming, organizational change, taxation) to explain persistence and promote gender equity across institutions.	A document is relevant to the query “gender” when gender is its central analytic focus—defining gender versus sex, examining gender roles and stereotypes, or addressing identities (e.g., transgender, cisgender, and androgyny) and inequalities such as the wage/work gaps and pay equity. Relevance is strengthened by concrete frameworks, evidence, or contexts, such as gender structure theory, doing/undoing gender, system justification theory, surveys like the European Social Survey, or case studies on gender centers and policies in universities or the EU (e.g., Gender Mainstreaming, institutional resistance). Pieces that only mention “gender” tangentially, treat it solely as biological sex without linking to social dimensions, or shift to broad “diversity” without gender-specific analysis are less relevant; similarly, mere glossary notes or passing historical references are weak matches. Non-English materials can still be highly relevant when they substantively analyze “Geschlecht,” “Gleichstellung,” or policy debates (e.g., German discussions of gender knowledge typologies and equality governance). Edge cases include methodological contributions (e.g., modeling “systemic gender knowledge”) or debates like the Gender Equality Personality Paradox—these remain relevant if they explicitly tie findings to gender processes and structures.
39449	sozialleistungen	The user is seeking an overview of social benefits, especially in Germany and the EU, including how generosity and financing have evolved under austerity, public attitudes toward cuts, and access rules for citizens, EU migrants, and third-country nationals. They want evidence on eligibility, discrimination, and policy impacts drawn from surveys, legal frameworks, and budget data.	A document is relevant if it directly addresses Sozialleistungen (social benefits) by discussing their levels, financing, eligibility rules, reforms, or usage, such as analyses of the Sozialleistungsquote, public support for benefit cuts, or access under EU free movement and laws like the Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz. Also relevant are studies on access for specific groups (EU citizens, third‑country nationals, asylum seekers), evidence of discrimination affecting benefit access, employer-provided “betriebliche Sozialleistungen” when framed as part of the benefits landscape, and legal frameworks like the Dutch Koppelingswet that link entitlements to status. Comparative or longitudinal work measuring redistribution via taxes and benefits across countries or time, as well as case studies from other countries that analyze entitlement to social benefits, should count as relevant. Non‑relevant would be pieces on poverty or workplace equality that never connect to benefit programs, purely ideological discussions (e.g., neoliberalism/Thatcherism) unless they specify concrete impacts on benefits, or mentions of services (health, transport) without tying them to social benefit schemes. Edge cases include company benefits that may be only marginally relevant if the intent is state welfare, and broad social policy overviews that mention Sozialleistungen only in passing without data or policy detail.
39506	sozialisation	The user is looking for a comprehensive overview of socialization as a social-science concept, covering definitions, theories, models, and empirical research across domains such as vocational training, political and international socialization, gender, military service, education, and life-course development. They want to understand key debates, effectiveness, and implications in largely German/European scholarship.	A document is relevant if it primarily defines, theorizes, or empirically examines Sozialisation—such as vocational socialization across training and careers, political socialization, gendered socialization, or international socialization of states—and discusses processes, mechanisms, models, or outcomes. Clear positives include textbooks or reviews linking life-course data (e.g., ALLBUS) to socialization, case studies of Bundeswehr conscripts, analyses of DDR vs. West German value trajectories, workplace/apprenticeship socialization, and edited volumes or TOCs whose chapters explicitly center on Sozialisation (e.g., “berufliche,” “politische,” “internationale,” “Selbstsozialisation”). Variants and compounds like Sozialisationsforschung, Sozialisationsprozess, Sozialisationsmodelle, and inflected forms count, and case does not matter. A document is non-relevant if Sozialisation is only a passing reference, appears solely in metadata or citations, or refers to a different concept (e.g., “Sozialisierung” as economic nationalization) without engaging socialization processes. Edge cases: critical or reframing debates (e.g., questioning “weibliche Sozialisation” in gender studies) remain relevant if they analyze how subjects become gendered, while broad education-system pieces that merely invoke Sozialisation as a background term without substantive treatment are borderline.
40249	soziale herkunft	The user seeks research-based insights on how social origin (class background) influences educational attainment, competence gaps, study choices, social mobility, and academic careers in Germany, and how these patterns have changed over time. They also want evidence on mechanisms, gender differences, and the role of school factors or policies in mitigating disparities, drawing on datasets like ALLBUS, NEPS, and SOEP.	A document is relevant if it explicitly analyzes soziale Herkunft (social/class background) and its effects on outcomes such as educational achievement, school transitions (e.g., Gymnasium attendance, degree attainment), study-field choice, academic careers (e.g., professors’ backgrounds), social mobility, or life satisfaction, ideally defining and measuring origin via parents’ education, occupation, or SES and modeling mechanisms (e.g., Bourdieu’s habitus, reproduction theory). Empirical studies using German datasets like ALLBUS, SOEP, or NEPS, or examining how school factors (teaching quality, full-day programs, class composition) shape competence gaps by social origin, are strongly relevant, as are time-trend or gender/field comparisons. Works that use close synonyms (social background, class origin, SES) or examine nationality/immigration only insofar as these are tied to class background and its effects can be partially relevant. A document is non-relevant if Herkunft refers solely to nationality/ethnicity/region or “migration background” without a class dimension, if it treats origin only in passing without analysis, or if it discusses unrelated meanings (e.g., product or genetic origin). Edge cases include theoretical or methodological pieces on mobility or habitus that lack new data (still relevant if they center the role of social origin), qualitative case studies (e.g., boarding schools’ doing/undoing class) that foreground class mechanisms, and near-duplicate summaries that add little unique evidence.
4027	migrationshintergrund	The user seeks an overview of the German concept of “Migrationshintergrund,” including how it is defined and measured across official statistics and surveys. They want evidence on how migration background relates to outcomes in health, education, labor market and welfare participation, and political engagement, with attention to gender, age, generation, and origin-group differences.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses the German concept “Migrationshintergrund” and provides substantive analysis, definitions, or statistics about people with and without migration background, including measurement approaches and domain-specific outcomes (e.g., health, education, labor market, political participation). Examples of highly relevant content include studies comparing ALG II recipients by Migrationshintergrund, KiGGS findings on adolescents’ health behaviors by migration background, analyses of scientists or seniors with Migrationshintergrund, or reports on rehabilitation access and dementia prevalence among these groups. Methodological debates and critiques of the term (e.g., municipal-statistical derivation vs self-identification, subgroup breakdowns by gender, origin, or generation) are also relevant because they clarify how the construct is defined and used. Non-relevant documents discuss migration broadly without using or mapping to the specific German concept, or mention the word only in passing (e.g., in a keyword list or citation) without analysis. Edge cases include English texts using “(im)migrant background” that clearly refer to the German statistical construct (relevant), and topic-adjacent pieces on refugees or international students that are only relevant if explicitly tied to the Migrationshintergrund framework.
4034	soziale ungleichheit	The user is looking for a comprehensive overview of social inequality—its definitions and theories (class, stratification, intersectionality), emerging dimensions and trends, and empirical patterns, particularly in Germany and Austria. They also want to understand consequences for health and aging, education, and the environment, along with public perceptions and policy debates around inequality.	A document is relevant if it primarily analyzes, defines, measures, or debates soziale Ungleichheit (social inequality) in society—such as class and stratification theories, income/wealth disparities, educational and health inequalities, perceptions of fairness, or “new” dimensions like aging, gender, migration, or environmental justice. Empirical studies (e.g., ALLBUS or the Sozialer Survey Österreich), theoretical syntheses in the Marx/Weber tradition or intersectionality, and sectoral reviews in social epidemiology or education are all relevant, even when focused on specific groups (older adults) or domains (health), provided the social-inequality link is explicit and central. Documents are non-relevant if they only mention inequality in passing, treat Ungleichheit purely as an economic indicator without social-structural analysis, or use the term in a mathematical sense. Edge cases include climate-change or environmental pieces: they are relevant when they explicitly connect unequal impacts to social stratification, vulnerability, or justice, but not when they note disparities without social analysis. Language or geography do not disqualify relevance (e.g., German texts on Germany or Austria are fine), whereas uses of “sozial” in unrelated contexts (like social media) or purely moral commentary without analytical content are not.
40380	soziale lage	The user seeks an overview of the concept of soziale Lage (social position) in Germany—how it is defined and measured (e.g., class/occupation, income, wealth), what determines it (family background), and its effects on life chances, health, and participation. They likely want empirical findings on intergenerational mobility and inequalities across regions and groups (East/West, gender, migrants), plus key data sources such as ALLBUS, SOEP, EVS, and the Mikrozensus.	A document is relevant if it treats soziale Lage as a social position or condition in society, defining or operationalizing it via class/strata concepts, household clusters, or multidimensional indicators. Empirical work that measures or compares social positions—e.g., by sex, age, employment status, East/West Germany, intergenerational mobility—using datasets like ALLBUS, SOEP, Mikrozensus, or EVS, and indicators such as income, wealth (including pensions), health, and political participation is squarely relevant. Studies on specific groups (teachers, migrants, single parents, refugees) or locales (e.g., DDR Umsiedler, Hamburg neighborhoods) are relevant when they explicitly analyze their soziale Lage or link it to inequality, mobility, or outcomes; methodological pieces on longitudinal/event-history models also qualify if they model transitions between social positions. Non-relevant are texts where Lage refers to geographic location, or policy commentary that mentions soziale Lage only in passing without defining, measuring, or comparing social positions. Edge cases include theory-driven work (e.g., Bourdieu’s social space), which is relevant if connected to mapping/measuring social positions, and attitude studies, which are relevant only when they model the effect of social position (class, education, income) on attitudes rather than just reporting opinions.
40505	soziale kontakte	The user seeks research-based insights into social contacts—how they are formed, measured, and leveraged—and their effects on integration and outcomes across contexts such as universities, migration/refugee settings, neighborhoods, online dating, and social media. Emphasis includes interethnic contact, language learning, attitudes toward refugees, access to resources and mobility, and methodological differences in measuring contact.	A document is relevant if it examines interpersonal social contacts—who interacts with whom, how frequently, and with what quality or outcomes—such as student–teacher relationships at universities, interethnic friendships between migrants and natives, refugees’ ties in neighborhoods, or contact initiation in online dating. Studies that link neighborhood context, personal networks, or friendship structures to integration, support, mobility, or social isolation (defined as a lack of close or casual contacts) are also relevant, as are methodological pieces on how interethnic contacts are measured with surveys or network generators. By contrast, texts that use “Kontakt” to mean exposure to information rather than people (e.g., incidental contact with campaign messages on social media) or that focus solely on institutional procedures without human-to-human interaction are only weakly relevant. Edge cases include research on social media or language learning: it is relevant when it addresses the formation or effects of interpersonal ties, but not when it discusses platform reach or skills acquisition without a social-contact component.
40541	soziale kompetenzen	The user is seeking information on social competencies: their definition, measurement, and how they can be developed. They want research-based insights on the impact of social competencies across contexts such as education and motivation, employability, intercultural training, reintegration, parenting, and gender dynamics.	A document is relevant if it explicitly examines soziale Kompetenzen (social competence/skills) as a construct, including its measurement, development, training, or effects in contexts like schooling, work, parenting, rehabilitation, or migration. Clear positives include empirical studies where social competence moderates student motivation, interventions such as inmate social-skills programs (e.g., SoKoS), hiring evaluations that rate applicants’ social competence, or research on children’s sozial-emotionale Kompetenzen linked to family factors. Theoretical treatments or frameworks that list “Soziale Kompetenz” (e.g., a chapter in a competencies volume or workforce reports highlighting social-interactive skills) are also relevant, as are studies of interkulturelle Kompetenz when they explicitly measure or discuss social/interactive components. Non-relevant are items where Kompetenz means jurisdiction/authority (state “Kompetenzen”), discussions of soziale Sicherung or welfare without social skills, or texts focused solely on other competencies (e.g., IT, media, or cognitive) with no substantive link to social competence—even if both words appear separately. Edge cases include synonyms like sozial-emotional or communicative skills, peer-relations training, or mixed “soziale und technische Kompetenzen”; these count if they analyze social skills in depth rather than mentioning them in passing.
40674	soziale arbeit	The user seeks an academic overview of social work (Soziale Arbeit), emphasizing its historical development and professionalization in Germany and its status as a scientific discipline. They want key theoretical frameworks and current debates on its political mandate, human-rights basis, gender/class perspectives, and practice domains such as refugee work and network governance.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses Soziale Arbeit/social work as a profession, discipline, or practice—e.g., tracing its historical development and professionalization, debating its political mandate, presenting theoretical frameworks (systems theory, human rights, class, gender), or discussing training, governance, and specific fields like refugee support or network management. Works that examine social work in particular contexts (East Germany, Czechoslovakia under socialism, relations to social movements, welfare associations) are also relevant when they link those contexts to social work’s functions, concepts, methods, or curricula. Synonyms and adjacent terms such as Sozialarbeit, Sozialpädagogik, IFSW definitions, DGSA/DBSH standards, or “Arbeit am Sozialen” count if they clearly pertain to the profession’s theory or practice. Non-relevant items are pieces about general “social” issues or labor/Arbeitsmarkt policy that use the words sozial/Arbeit without analyzing social work, or texts that only name Soziale Arbeit in passing (e.g., as a keyword) without substantive treatment. Edge cases include critiques of “social work” by non-professional actors (e.g., far-right “sozialarbeiterische” activities) which are relevant if they analyze implications for the field, and documents in English are acceptable if they are clearly about social work despite the German query.
41495	soziale medien	The user is seeking academic, research-based insights into the roles and impacts of social media—especially in Germany—covering defense communication (Bundeswehr), political campaigns, extremism and “dark” platforms, identity and cultural change, media trust, and health communication. They want overviews, frameworks, and empirical findings that explain how social media shapes discourse, legitimacy, and prevention/education efforts.	A document is relevant if it centrally examines social media platforms, practices, or effects—using terms like soziale Medien/soziale Netzwerke or naming specific platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Telegram, VKontakte, Gab)—and provides substantive analysis such as policy, communication, or behavioral impacts. Examples include studies of the Bundeswehr’s social media communication, analyses of “dark social media” and extremist use of Telegram or fringe communities, election campaigning via social networks using GLES data, or experiments about responsibility framing on Instagram. Documents that discuss “media” in general (press, TV, audiovisual media, media privatization) without a clear focus on social networking functions, or that only mention social media in passing, are non-relevant. Edge cases include blogs and forums (often counted as social media if user-generated and networked), messaging apps (Telegram/WhatsApp) which are relevant when treated as social platforms, and broad mediatization or media literacy pieces that are only weakly relevant unless they explicitly analyze social media’s distinct affordances and uses.
41546	soziale netzwerke	The user is looking for sociological research on social networks, including theoretical frameworks, measurement approaches (e.g., egocentric networks), and the distinction from social support. They want empirical findings on how networks influence outcomes across domains like entrepreneurship, health, migration, labor markets, aging, and social work, with emphasis on German studies.	A document is relevant if it centrally examines “soziale Netzwerke” in the sociological or social-media sense—defining networks, analyzing their structure or function, or reporting empirical findings about how ties among individuals or organizations affect outcomes. Examples include studies of entrepreneurs’ networks and gendered differences in self-employment success, qualitative or egocentric network methods (e.g., ALLBUS ego networks, network maps in neighborhoods), or research on network effects in health, employment, aging, or migration (including analyses that use platforms like VKontakte as data sources). Methodological debates distinguishing social networks from social support, or theoretical treatments of network identity, roles, and expectations are also relevant when “soziale Netzwerke” is a core focus. Non-relevant are items where “Netzwerke” refers to non-social systems (computer/electrical networks), where the term appears only tangentially or metaphorically, or content focused solely on individual factors without relational structures. Edge cases include documents about “soziale Medien” (usually relevant), policy or organizational networks between actors (relevant), the film “The Social Network” (relevant only if used to discuss networks), and pieces on social support that do not engage with network structure (often not relevant unless the distinction is the topic).
4160	stress	The user seeks a synthesis of research on stress that compares psychological self-reports with physiological markers (e.g., salivary cortisol), examines effects on memory and health, and explores occupational and family stress across diverse groups. They also want insight into measurement tools and paradigms (e.g., PHQ-9, CES-D, KOSS, ISSL, TSST/VR) and broader sociological or state-level patterns to inform more comprehensive stress assessment and prevention.	A document is relevant if it directly examines stress—psychological or physiological—its measurement, causes, moderators, or consequences. Studies measuring cortisol or using stress inductions (e.g., Trier Social Stress Test/VR variants), occupational stress in teachers, nurses, firefighters, or drivers, sociological stress indices, or family/parenting stress predicting youth outcomes are good examples. Papers assessing closely linked constructs such as perceived stress, workload, coping strategies, psychosomatic complaints, or stress effects on memory and performance also qualify, provided stress is a central variable. Non-relevant items only mention stress tangentially, focus solely on downstream conditions (e.g., depression) without assessing/manipulating stress, or use “stress” in other senses (e.g., mechanical stress). Edge cases like null correlations between self-reported and physiological stress, duplicated abstracts, or VR paradigms that fail to elicit cortisol are still relevant when the study’s aim is to induce or measure stress.
41655	soziale mobilität	The user is seeking research-based information on social mobility—its concepts, measures, and theories—and empirical findings on intergenerational mobility and perceived status change. The focus includes links to spatial/job mobility, migration and precarious digital labor, and impacts on lifestyles and inequalities in Europe, especially Germany.	A document is relevant if it treats soziale Mobilität as changes in social position or stratification—e.g., vertical up- and downward mobility, horizontal moves, inter- or intragenerational mobility—and discusses mechanisms such as education, occupation, class/schicht, or habitus (for instance, ALLBUS-based status-attainment studies or Bourdieu-informed models of lifestyle and origin effects). It also counts as relevant when mobility is linked to biography, migration, or multilocal living and explicitly connects spatial mobility to social outcomes, such as analyses of transnational biographies, refugee trajectories, university access, or the ambiguous status of Instagram influencers where “horizontal mobility” challenges meritocratic narratives. Documents comparing parents’ and children’s positions, examining perceptions of upward/downward movement, or mapping how precarious, feminized, or platform labor reshapes status are squarely on-topic. Non-relevant are pieces where “Mobilität” means only physical/transport or commuting (trip counts, car use, travel behavior) without an explicit tie to social status or stratification, though they become relevant if they analyze how spatial mobility produces or constrains social mobility. Edge cases include academic career mobility or elderly mobility: these are relevant only when framed as status change, inequality, or class reproduction rather than mere movement through space.
4182	stress am arbeitsplatz	The user seeks information on workplace stress—its causes (e.g., digitalization, monitoring, workload, role conflict, mobbing, job insecurity) and effects on health, work ability, and work–life balance. They also want evidence-based assessment tools and effective prevention, intervention, and coping strategies.	A document is relevant if it examines stress specifically in the workplace context—its causes (e.g., surveillance, autonomy loss, role conflict/ambiguity, job insecurity), experiences, consequences (health, performance, turnover), measurement (validated scales for social stressors), or interventions (prevention, mediation, supervision) for employees. Highly relevant examples include studies on digitization leading to technostress and altered work ability, analyses of mobbing am Arbeitsplatz with legal and organizational remedies, reliable instruments to assess social stressors in work groups, and research linking effort–reward imbalance or job insecurity to outcomes like alcohol use. Also relevant are accounts of COVID-era home office stress and work–life balance, clinician communication training that reduces doctors’ workplace stress, and organizational change cases (e.g., flexible manufacturing) that heighten demands and dissatisfaction. Non-relevant items include stress in families or student populations without a workplace link, broad sociological overviews that don’t analyze the work setting, therapeutic methods not tied to job contexts (e.g., horse-assisted coaching), or outplacement discussions centered on business logic with only incidental stress mentions. Edge cases include commuting studies—these are relevant only if they connect commuting to job-related stress or health outcomes—and texts that mention “Arbeitsplatz” but do not analyze workplace stressors, which would be weak matches.
427	migration	Seeks a comprehensive overview of migration, including theories and evidence on forms such as circular, internal, student, and asylum/irregular migration, their drivers (economic, political, environmental), and impacts on development, urban change, and health. Also looks for Europe- and Germany-focused analyses of trends and measurement (stocks vs flows), governance and securitization, and predictive tools for managing migration flows.	A document is relevant if it primarily examines human migration—international or internal—its drivers, patterns, policies, or impacts on societies and individuals. Examples include studies of circular migration as a management tool, analyses of internal migration among young Swedes, work on the migration–city nexus, the securitization of migration, or research linking migration background to healthcare use; comparisons of asylum versus total migration, remittances and migration, or definitions of environmental migration also clearly qualify. Historical and theoretical pieces that interrogate categories (e.g., voluntary vs. forced, migration regimes, autonomy of migration) are relevant when they center on people’s mobility and its governance. Non-relevant items would use “migration” for unrelated domains (data/IT migration, animal migration), mention it only in passing, or invoke it metaphorically without analyzing human movement; by contrast, documents in other languages about Migrantenfamilien or service access remain relevant because their core focus is human migration. Method-heavy evaluations (e.g., predictive tools, flow vs. stock models, move-order metrics) are also relevant if they are applied to understanding or governing human migratory flows.
43444	consumer	The user seeks a research-based overview of consumer behavior and psychology across demographics and contexts, including factors shaping purchases (e.g., gender, ethnocentrism, packaging, organic food) and the influence of early adopters and firm strategies. They also want to understand consumer protection and data privacy—especially in the EU—and how regulations (e.g., UCPD, PDO/PGI) affect trust, satisfaction, and market outcomes such as cross-border buying.	A document is relevant if it substantively discusses consumers, such as their behavior, preferences, trust, protection, purchasing patterns, or the policies and market practices that affect them (for example, studies on EU consumer protection, analyses of “Mrs. Consumer” buying psychology, or research on packaging effects on consumer choice). Works that measure consumer outcomes like satisfaction, willingness to pay, or logo awareness, or that examine how firms’ actions influence consumer decisions, also qualify. Content focused mainly on producers, firms, or regulation without a clear link to consumer impact, or that only mentions “consumer” in passing, would be non-relevant. Edge cases include terms like consumer surplus in economics (usually relevant if tied to consumer welfare), “consumer data” in privacy contexts (relevant if centered on consumer risks/benefits), or uses of “consumer” in unrelated domains such as ecology or computing message-queue “consumers” (non-relevant). Synonyms such as customer, shopper, or buyer, and plural/singular or historical framings like “Mrs. Consumer,” should count when the focus remains on end-user behavior and welfare.
43698	covid19	The user seeks a cross-disciplinary overview of COVID-19, emphasizing data-driven research on how the pandemic and restrictions affected mobility, social values and fear, mental well-being, inequality and trust, and sectoral systems such as marketing, education, transit, trade, and international relations. They want factors influencing infection rates and regional resilience, plus case studies and recovery strategies.	For the query “covid19,” documents are most relevant when COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 is the primary focus—such as analyses of mobility during restrictions in Switzerland, studies linking infection rates to social capital or inequality (GINI), operational responses by transit agencies, or sectoral shifts like digital marketing during the pandemic. Work that examines social or cultural dynamics specifically in the context of the COVID-19 emergency (e.g., changes in Gen Z values, fear narratives that center the pandemic, or educational technology adoption explicitly driven by COVID-19) is also relevant, provided the pandemic is central to the analysis rather than a mere backdrop. By contrast, pieces that only mention COVID-19 in passing (e.g., “post-COVID-19” as a time marker) while focusing on unrelated topics like Chinese foreign policy or Eurasian rail geopolitics are non-relevant, unless they present concrete pandemic effects (for instance, data on rail freight growth during the epidemic). Variant terms and spellings (COVID19, COVID 19, SARS CoV-2, coronavirus) should be treated as matches, and methodological or weekly reports tied to COVID-19 outcomes count as relevant, whereas mere citations or tangential references do not. Edge cases include multi-topic documents where only a section provides substantive COVID-19 analysis (partially relevant) and duplicated or boilerplate text invoking the pandemic without new evidence or detail (non-relevant).
43910	covid	The user seeks an overview of COVID-19, emphasizing research on public health measures and vaccination alongside the pandemic’s wider social, economic, and political impacts and policy responses across countries.	A document is relevant to the query “covid” when it substantively discusses COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) itself or its consequences, such as spread, behavioral measures, vaccination, health risks, and societal, economic, or political impacts. For example, studies on risk-group adherence to masking and distancing, links between social exclusion during containment and radicalism, determinants of vaccination uptake in Germany, marketplace policies in Ghana, Japan’s “Jishuku” approach, or analyses of FDI, tourism, digital inequality, and regional security under COVID-19 are all clearly relevant. Content focused on adjacent domains remains relevant if it is explicitly anchored to COVID-era measures or outcomes (e.g., work-life balance during lockdowns, survey practices used to track pandemic attitudes, or microsimulation of pandemic income supports). Non-relevant items would only name “COVID” in passing as a timestamp without analysis, use “pandemic” generically with no clear tie to COVID-19, discuss other diseases, or use “COVID” as an unrelated acronym. Edge cases include variant spellings (“COVID 19,” “Covid-19,” “coronavirus”), discussions of “long COVID,” comparative pieces where COVID is one of several crises (relevant if COVID-specific evidence is provided), and methodological papers that are relevant only if their design or findings are explicitly about COVID-related data or outcomes.
44361	culture	The user seeks academic perspectives that define and theorize culture and examine how cultural identity is constructed and negotiated—particularly in Europe—amid diversity, globalization, and social change. They want surveys and case studies spanning cultural areas, policy, and cross-cultural comparisons informed by sociology and cultural studies.	A document is relevant to the query “culture” when it substantively engages with culture as a social or humanistic concept—defining it, theorizing it, or analyzing cultural identities, practices, institutions, and change. Examples include discussions of European cultural identity and border areas, surveys of Simmel’s writings on culture, analyses of globalization’s effects on Taiwanese or Caribbean cultures, or studies of business/organizational culture and cultural trauma. Review essays and methodological pieces in cultural studies, cultural history, or cultural geography also qualify because they synthesize or operationalize “culture” across cases. Non-relevant items include occurrences where “culture” appears only as boilerplate (e.g., a series title) or in non-humanistic senses like cell/microbial culture; edge cases are literary works or policy texts that mention “culture” tangentially (e.g., a Ministry of Culture) without analyzing cultural phenomena, which would be weakly relevant at best. Given the query’s breadth, documents spanning subfields such as popular culture, identity formation, and cultural inequality are relevant, but mere keyword repetition without substantive content should not qualify.
4472	stress work	Find research on occupational stress across occupations and settings—especially nursing—covering comparative stress levels, key stressors (e.g., workload, environment, commuting), and outcomes such as health complaints, burnout, performance, and turnover. Identify evidence-based assessments and interventions or coping strategies to mitigate work stress.	A document is relevant if it addresses stress that arises in an employment or job context—using concepts like occupational stress, job stress, workload, work environment, or work-related strain—and examines its causes, effects, or interventions. Examples that fit include comparisons of stress in inpatient vs. outpatient nurses, studies of bus drivers’ job stress, hospital nursing stress and its health impacts, commuting-to-work unpredictability as a stressor, and postdocs’ work stress linked to turnover intentions. Intervention papers tied to workplace outcomes (e.g., expressive writing reducing exhaustion, stress affecting motivation and performance in hospitals) are also relevant. Non-relevant items include uses of “stressed” meaning “emphasized” or “work” meaning a body of writing/art (e.g., analyses of Gramsci and Bakhtin’s works), or discussions of stress unrelated to employment. Edge cases include commuting stress only if explicitly tied to work, domestic or student “work” that may not qualify as employment, or documents mentioning only one keyword without a clear work-stress linkage.
45770	climate change attitudes	The user seeks comparative evidence on what shapes public attitudes toward climate change, how these attitudes differ across countries, and how they translate into policy support and individual actions. They are interested in factors such as political identity/ideology, education, prosperity, trust, gender, and media influences, with findings from large surveys (e.g., ISSP, Eurobarometer) highlighting contrasts among Anglophone, Western European, and post-Communist contexts.	A document is relevant if it examines people’s beliefs, perceptions, concern, or polarization about climate change and the factors that shape them, or how these attitudes influence behaviors and policy support. Strong fits include survey-based analyses (e.g., ISSP, Eurobarometer) that test predictors such as political identity, free-market ideology, education, trust in government, prosperity, or gender, cross-national comparisons (Anglophone vs Western Europe vs post-Communist states), and studies of the attitude–action gap. Work that links media or education to shifts in climate attitudes (e.g., film effects, classroom interventions) or that shows how climate concern predicts specific actions (energy saving, transport, food choices) is also relevant. By contrast, pieces focused mainly on climate science, technology, emissions, or organizational adaptation without measuring attitudes, or on general environmental or biodiversity attitudes with no explicit climate-change comparison, are non-relevant. Edge cases count as relevant if they connect behaviors or adjacent issues to measured climate attitudes (e.g., food purchasing framed as climate mitigation, country-specific case studies, or dataset introductions that report climate-attitude items and trends).
45793	climate	The query seeks scholarly research on the social, political, and behavioral dimensions of climate change. It covers public trust in climate science, communication and media dynamics, equity/responsibility metrics, aid and policy effectiveness, activism, adaptation and risk communication, migration and security framings, gender perspectives, and determinants of pro-environmental behavior.	A document is relevant to the query “climate” when it substantively addresses Earth’s climate system or climate change—its science, impacts, equity, policy, communication, or behavior—rather than merely mentioning the word. Examples of clear relevance include surveys of trust in IPCC projections, evaluations of whether climate aid drives climate legislation, analyses of climate equity using cumulative emissions indicators, studies of climate activism and risk communication, or links between climate literacy and migration intentions. Content is non-relevant when “climate” is used in another sense (e.g., “organizational climate” in schools or workplaces) or when the term appears only in passing without analysis of climatic phenomena or responses. Some items are partially relevant, such as media or political discourse during COP meetings or national securitization debates (e.g., Japan), which still center on climate communication and policy. Edge cases include non-English sections that match the topic but may be less usable, duplicated passages that add no new information, and methodological critiques that remain relevant if they explicitly assess climate outcomes (e.g., data quality in climate aid and policy measures).
4600	gewalt	The user seeks scholarly, interdisciplinary resources that define and theorize violence (including physical, structural, cultural, and epistemic forms). They want analyses of how violence manifests and is experienced across diverse contexts—animals, gender, racism, family, schools, work/care, queer communities, and refugee settings—along with data, frameworks, and responses.	A document is relevant if it substantively engages the German concept of Gewalt—defining it, debating its scope (e.g., physical versus structural, cultural, or epistemic violence), or analyzing concrete contexts such as domestic/family violence, school violence, racist or gender-based violence, queer anti-violence work, or violence against animals, and uses related compounds like Gewalthandlungen, Gewaltschutz, Gewaltforschung, or Anti-Gewalt. Relevance increases when the text details forms and practices of violence, social mechanisms that sustain or normalize it, historical developments, victims’ perspectives, and prevention or policy frameworks (for example, the Istanbul Convention or hate-crime research). Documents are non-relevant if they only mention the word in passing (e.g., in bibliographies or lists of chapter titles) or use it in unrelated fixed expressions such as Gewaltenteilung, höhere Gewalt (force majeure), or the adjective gewaltig. Metaphorical or extended uses like epistemische Gewalt can still be relevant if they analyze harm, power, and social relations rather than invoking the term as a loose flourish. Edge cases include multilingual pieces that discuss “violence” without the German keyword, or texts about physical “force” in science; these are generally non-relevant unless they explicitly connect back to the social-scientific notion of Gewalt.
46134	care arbeit	The user seeks an overview of care work (Care-Arbeit) in Germany/Europe—what it is, why it is undervalued, and how gender relations, welfare-state policy, neoliberal restructuring, professionalization/digitization, and migration-driven care chains shape it. They also want evidence and policy approaches to improve pay, rights, and gender equality across paid and unpaid care.	For the query “care arbeit,” documents are relevant when they treat caregiving as work (Care-Arbeit/Sorge- oder Pflegearbeit), whether paid or unpaid, and analyze its organization, conditions, remuneration, regulation, or gendered distribution. Examples include studies of Pflegeberufe, 24-hour live-in care by migrant women, “global care chains,” professionalization/marketization of the care sector, union strategies, wage comparisons, or welfare-state and feminist-citizenship debates that recast care as civic duty or labor. Theoretical or empirical pieces qualify if the labor dimension is central, e.g., Nancy Fraser’s “universal caregiver,” value theory explaining the devaluation of care, or the impact of digitization on training and careers in care occupations. Non-relevant items use “care” in unrelated senses (self-care, NGO/brand “CARE,” environmental care) or discuss health services/family relations without framing caregiving as labor, as well as texts that mention “Arbeit” generally but never caregiving. Edge cases: German synonyms (Sorgearbeit, Pflegearbeit) and mixed-language titles are relevant; pieces expanding “care” to nonhuman nature or purely moral-philosophical ethics are only marginal unless they connect back to the work, pay, or policy of care labor.
4690	gesundheit	The user seeks a scholarly overview of the concept of health, contrasting functional and subjective health and integrating biomedical, biopsychosocial, and salutogenic models. They want evidence on how aging, gender/cohort, socioeconomic inequality, migration, work conditions, and crises (pandemics, war) affect health, along with implications for public health policy and the right to health.	For the broad keyword “gesundheit” (health), a document is relevant when it substantively discusses health concepts, indicators, outcomes, or systems—such as definitions of health, epidemiology, public health, clinical versus preventive approaches, or measured changes in physical, mental, or subjective health. Examples include analyses of functional vs. subjective health across aging and gender, cohort trends, links between income/wealth inequality and health, workplace health promotion, migration-related health access, pandemic effects, or debates over the WHO health definition. Interdisciplinary, historical, legal, or policy treatments (e.g., Asklepios/Hygieia as health concepts, the right to health, health system resilience in crises) also count if health remains the primary focus. Non-relevant are texts where “Gesundheit” is only incidental or formulaic (a sneeze response), a brand or proper name, or a metaphor unrelated to human health (e.g., “the health of the economy”), or documents about other topics that only mention health in passing. Edge cases like health insurance or wellness marketing are relevant only if they assess effects on health outcomes; duplicates or literature reviews still qualify, while purely economic or demographic pieces must explicitly connect their analysis to health indicators to be considered relevant.
47291	drug	The user is looking for research and analyses on drugs that examine how policy, regulation, and markets influence prices, prescribing, use, and crime across countries, as well as the effectiveness of treatment and public health campaigns. They seek comparative, empirical evidence on approaches like decriminalization, harm reduction, and enforcement and their outcomes.	A document is relevant to the query “drug” if it substantively addresses pharmaceuticals or illicit substances in contexts such as pricing and access (e.g., patents raising HIV/AIDS drug prices in low- and middle-income countries), clinical practice (e.g., GPs modifying hospital-prescribed regimens), public policy and law (e.g., Scandinavian drug control differences, decriminalization effects), or prevention/treatment and public health campaigns (e.g., radio/TV anti-drug initiatives). Also relevant are sociological and historical analyses (e.g., the U.S. crack scare, harm reduction vs. prohibition, legalization’s impact on crime), case studies of use and dependency (e.g., heroin use leading to HIV), and security dimensions (e.g., cartel violence and enforcement). Non-relevant items are those where “drug” is only incidental (appearing in references or metadata), used figuratively (“power is a drug”), or appears as an unrelated acronym, or where the study’s focus lacks medication or substance-use content. Edge cases include single-substance or distribution-focused pieces (e.g., thalidomide’s controlled distribution), which are relevant if they discuss regulation, risk, or clinical use; by contrast, materials about “drugstore” retail marketing or fictional scenes of someone being “drugged” would not meet the query’s intent.
4811	ukraine	A concise, up-to-date overview of Ukraine’s geopolitical and security situation, including EU accession and NATO prospects, Western (EU/US) policies and support mechanisms, and Russia’s ongoing aggression and influence. It also seeks insight into Ukraine’s domestic governance and economic-security reforms, accountability for war crimes, and the implications for European stability.	A document is relevant to the query “ukraine” when Ukraine is a primary focus—politics, war, security, economy, law, or international alignment—and offers substantive discussion, such as EU candidacy and enlargement debates, U.S. and Russian policies toward Ukraine, NATO prospects, accountability for war crimes, IMF support, or Ukraine’s internal legal frameworks for economic and national security. Pieces analyzing how the EU funds Ukraine’s defense, bilateral security assurances, or social and cultural dimensions (for example, the semiotics of maps of Ukraine during wartime) are also clearly relevant. By contrast, texts that only name-drop Ukraine while discussing broad EU fiscal design, generic Russia-West relations, or unrelated regional topics without concrete Ukraine-specific analysis are weakly relevant or non-relevant. Edge cases include comparative studies where Ukraine is just one of several cases (relevant if it gets substantial treatment), articles centered on Crimea/Donbas/Kyiv or the “Ukrainian crisis” without saying “Ukraine” explicitly (topically relevant though a literal keyword match might miss them), and diaspora or historical-nationalism pieces that mention Ukraine—relevant only if they tie clearly to Ukraine’s current policy, security, or societal context.
4835	media	The user seeks scholarly analyses of media systems and practices, emphasizing the political economy of media (including social platforms), media performance and bias, concentration and fragmentation, and comparative case studies across regions. The goal is to understand how media structures, policies, and digital platforms shape news production, audience relations, and democratic communication.	For the query “media,” a document is relevant when it centrally examines media as communication systems—mass, news, social, or transnational—addressing their structures, performance, policies, economics, audiences, or practices. Examples that clearly match include analyses of social media commodification in Indonesian newsrooms, accounts of media capture in Turkey, studies of media performance in the digital age, work on media concentration/fragmentation and bias, or research on media literacy among youth. Documents are non-relevant if “media” is only a passing mention or used in an unrelated sense (e.g., culture media in biology, mixed-media art techniques, or anatomical references like the tunica media). Edge cases include pieces where “Media” appears only in an organization’s name or where “mass media” is a model parameter; these are relevant only if they substantively analyze media influence rather than merely name it. Given the breadth of the keyword, prioritize topical centrality and depth—documents with “media” in the title/abstract and sustained discussion should outrank general political or sociological texts that mention media incidentally.
49615	digitalization	The user seeks an overview of digitalization’s impacts on society and organizations, including public services, education/VET, telework, and enterprise transformation. They want research and policies on digital inclusion and skills (digital literacy gaps, digital citizenship, inequality), along with frameworks and maturity models and interventions (e.g., EU and library programs) that support equitable participation.	A document is relevant to the query “digitalization” when it examines the systemic adoption and impact of digital technologies on organizations, governments, economies, or society—often framed as digital transformation, digital-by-default public services, digital maturity, platformization, or capability building. Studies on national programs (e.g., the EU Digital Compass or Dutch Digital Inclusion), corporate digital transformation and maturity models, platform ethics and power asymmetries, telework-driven upskilling, or organizational change (including gender dynamics) are clearly relevant because they address the processes and consequences of becoming more digitally organized. Work centered on digital citizenship, digital skills, or digital literacies is relevant if it explicitly links these topics to broader digitalization trends (access to digital public services, participation in a digital welfare state, labor market shifts), but more borderline if it only inventories skills without connecting to transformation processes. Pieces focused on disciplinary labels (e.g., Digital Humanities vs Digital Archaeology) or narrowly technical training taxonomies with no discussion of organizational or societal change are weakly relevant or non-relevant. Edge cases include “digitization” (narrow conversion) versus “digitalization” (transformational change): the former is only relevant when tied to wider transformation, and country case studies or age-related digital inclusion are relevant if they analyze systemic effects rather than isolated tool use.
50072	digital	The user seeks a synthesized understanding of digital citizenship, literacy, and inclusion—how these concepts are defined versus practiced, where skill gaps and inequalities persist, and how policies, training, and measurement frameworks can promote equitable participation in digital societies. They also want comparative evidence across contexts (libraries, education, workplaces, EU and Global South) to assess effective interventions and policy–practice misalignments.	For the broad query “digital,” a document is relevant if it substantively analyzes digital technologies, practices, policies, skills, or transformations—ideally signaled in the title, abstract, or section headings. Examples include studies of digital citizenship and inclusion (e.g., librarians’ roles or the Dutch Digital Inclusion programme), work on digital literacies across the lifespan, evidence on digital skills gaps (Global South or youth), organizational or educational digital transformation (VET, telework), and analyses of digital platforms and the digital divide. A document is less relevant when “digital” is only a passing mention, appears solely in a proper noun without accompanying analysis, or the piece focuses on adjacent concepts (ICT, internet use) without engaging the “digital” theme—especially if strict keyword matching is used. Edge cases include fields like Digital Humanities or Digital Archaeology: they are relevant when they discuss digital methods or infrastructures, but less so if “digital” functions mostly as a disciplinary label; likewise, policy items (EU Digital Compass, Digital Poland) are relevant when they detail digital principles, competencies, or implementation rather than merely naming initiatives. Morphological and compound variants (digitization, digitalization, digitally, digital divide, digital maturity) should count as relevant, whereas homonymous uses (e.g., anatomical “digits”) or occurrences only in citations or affiliations should not.
50270	digital skills	The user seeks an evidence-based overview of digital skills—how they are defined and measured, the scale and drivers of skill gaps across countries and demographic groups, and their impacts on work, wages, and inclusion. They also want to know which policies and training approaches effectively build digital skills (e.g., education, broadband access, ICT use, adult learning) to close these gaps.	A document is relevant if it defines, measures, compares, or develops digital skills (including synonyms like digital literacy, ICT skills, or digital problem-solving) or links them to outcomes such as employment, wages, inclusion, or education. Strong examples include studies using PIAAC/OECD data to quantify skill levels and gaps (e.g., Global South vs. high-income countries, youth of color, older workers, adults with learning disabilities), analyses of how telework or industry digitalization changes skill demands and rewards, and frameworks showing how ICT use, literacy, motivation, access, and social support shape digital skills. Policy evaluations and methodological work that map occupational digital skill requirements or assess training effectiveness also count, even when using self-reported measures or focusing on specific domains like algorithmic/datafication literacy. Non-relevant items are those that discuss digitalization broadly (infrastructure, broadband, tasks, or technology adoption) without connecting to individuals’ skills, or that use “skills” in unrelated senses; edge cases like health information seeking or civic engagement are relevant only when they explicitly measure digital skills or tie outcomes to skill levels.
5030	sicherheitsgefühl	The query seeks research on the public’s sense of security (Sicherheitsgefühl), especially in Germany—how it is defined and measured, how it varies across regions and over time, its relationship to police presence and actual crime, the role of demographics, and implications for policing and public policy.	A document is relevant if it directly addresses Sicherheitsgefühl as a subjective sense of safety and examines its determinants, measurement, or consequences—e.g., studies on police presence and perceived safety, fear of crime, demographic drivers, or trends and comparisons across German cities or European countries. Clear examples include randomized or panel surveys linking police presence to Sicherheitsgefühl, critiques of standard “alone at night” indicators, analyses of East–West urban differences, or demographic projections showing how aging populations affect fear of crime. Contextual applications are also relevant when they explicitly connect practices or settings to perceived safety, such as festival awareness concepts, neighborhood dialogue forums, housing conditions shaping residents’ sense of safety, or legal/policy discussions framing the state’s role in protecting perceived security. Documents are only marginally relevant if they mention Sicherheitsgefühl in passing within broader topics (e.g., social justice or party politics) without analyzing its causes or measurement. Non-relevant items include IT/cyber “security” feelings, crime-statistics pieces that never engage with perceived safety, or uses of Sicherheitsgefühl as intra-group cohesion (e.g., biker subcultures) with no link to public safety or crime risk.
505	diskriminierung	The user seeks a comprehensive overview of discrimination, including definitions and theories (individual vs institutional/structural), causes such as preference-based vs statistical bias, and methods of measurement. They want empirical findings across labor, housing, and education—especially affecting migrants and minorities (e.g., Muslims, Roma)—along with the relevant legal frameworks and policy responses in Germany/Europe.	A document is relevant if it substantively analyzes, measures, theorizes, or reports on discrimination (Diskriminierung) in social, legal, institutional, or economic contexts, especially in German-speaking settings. Examples include field experiments on hiring bias by ethnicity, phenotype, and religion; surveys of perceived discrimination at universities; studies of housing-market access, price discrimination, and segregation; or work that distinguishes preference-based versus statistical discrimination and examines institutional or intersectional mechanisms. Methodological or conceptual pieces that define discrimination, propose coding schemes for linguistic discrimination, or review legal and policy frameworks (e.g., AGG, ILO reports) are also relevant even if largely theoretical. Documents are non-relevant if they only mention the term in passing, use it metaphorically, or discuss adjacent topics (e.g., general citizenship theory) without linking to discriminatory mechanisms, evidence, or policy. Edge cases include normative debates about “legitimate” versus “illegitimate” discrimination at borders or Gleichbehandlung/Benachteiligung studies that may remain relevant if they explicitly connect to discrimination processes and outcomes, while bare dataset descriptions without discrimination findings would be borderline.
50581	digitalisierung	The user seeks a comprehensive overview of digitalization as a societal megatrend—its drivers, benefits, and risks—and its impacts across labor markets, democracy, education, governance, culture, and religion. They also want policy and practice guidance to shape these outcomes, including curriculum modernization, adult learning, gig-economy regulation, and social safety nets such as basic income.	A document is relevant if it substantively examines Digitalisierung as a broad socio-technical transformation—e.g., its impacts on labor markets and Industrie 4.0, democracy and misinformation, education and adult learning, sectoral contexts like churches or public administration, or policy responses such as gig-economy regulation and basic income. Empirical reports, policy analyses, theoretical overviews, and case studies that explicitly frame AI, broadband, automation, or workplace surveillance as parts of Digitalisierung also qualify, including variants like digitale Transformation or the English digitalization/digitisation. Partially relevant items discuss digital tools or corporate communication only insofar as they connect them to systemic organizational or societal change. Non-relevant are pieces that use “digital” merely as an adjective (e.g., devices, scanning documents), fleeting mentions in intros or bibliographies, or promotional content without analytical depth. Edge cases include chapter lists or abstracts naming Digitalisierung without substance, which are weakly relevant, while narrow technology studies are relevant only when situated within the broader dynamics of Digitalisierung.
5065	sicherheitsempfinden	The user seeks an overview of “Sicherheitsempfinden” (subjective sense of security) in Germany—its definition, measurement, and key drivers such as crime exposure, media, demographics, and vulnerability. They also want evidence on its consequences for quality of life, voting behavior, and attitudes toward policing, public spaces, and policy.	A document is relevant if it directly addresses the subjective sense of security (Sicherheitsempfinden)—for example by defining it, measuring it with surveys or indicators, or analyzing its determinants or consequences (such as media coverage, personal victimization, vulnerability, demographics, or effects on voting in the 2017 Bundestag election using datasets like GLES or ALLBUS). Studies that compare subjective perceptions to objective crime statistics, or that examine specific contexts—public spaces, policing and border control, refugee-related crime debates, campus sexual harassment, or urban quality of life—are also relevant, even when limited to subpopulations (e.g., women in Heidelberg or older workers). Analyses of “symbolic” security policy that explicitly discuss managing public feelings of safety qualify as well. Non-relevant documents are those that only treat objective security or crime without linking to perceived safety, or that use “Sicherheit” in unrelated senses (e.g., IT security, purely financial/job security) without discussing subjective feelings. Edge cases include papers that mention Sicherheitsempfinden only in passing without empirical or conceptual treatment, or that use synonyms or variants like subjektives Sicherheitsgefühl/Unsicherheitsempfinden, which should still be considered if the focus is on perceived safety.
50992	digitalisierung arbeit	The user seeks analyses of how digitalization is transforming work—its conditions, organization, employment, and skill requirements—across sectors. They want sociological and policy perspectives on shaping this change (e.g., co-determination, gender equality, training, and sector-specific cases) rather than purely technological views.	A document is relevant if it explicitly links digitalization (Digitalisierung) to work/labor (Arbeit), such as effects on working conditions, job design, employment, skills/qualification, co-determination, or gender relations—e.g., analyses of Industry/Arbeit 4.0, logistics or care sectors, office work, platform/crowdwork, or surveys of Betriebsräte. Both empirical studies (case studies, interviews, surveys) and theoretical or policy pieces are relevant when they frame digital transformation in workplace contexts, even if new technology itself plays a minor role (e.g., governance, organizational processes, or negotiation of change). Non-relevant items are those about digitizing archives or cultural heritage, general e-government or education technology without ties to employment or workplace practice, or uses of “Arbeit” in unrelated senses. Edge cases include broad digital-capitalism debates or gender-equality discussions: they are relevant only if they connect to labor outcomes or workplace design; likewise, education/training pieces qualify when they address vocational or job-related upskilling. German synonyms and cues like Arbeitswelt, Arbeitsorganisation, Mitbestimmung, Qualifizierung, Industrie 4.0, mobile Arbeit, or Geschlechterverhältnisse in Betrieben are strong indicators of relevance.
51730	alkohol	The user seeks research-based information on alcohol consumption, including prevalence and trends, youth drinking behaviors, sociocultural and workplace determinants, and related health and social consequences. Emphasis is on German data and surveys (e.g., ESA) with international comparisons and evaluations of prevention and policy measures.	A document is relevant to the query “alkohol” when it substantively discusses alcohol itself—its consumption, culture, policy, health or social effects, or provides data or analysis about alcohol (e.g., U.S. campus binge drinking, workplace stress linked to alcohol use, or ESA 2021 prevalence and dependence measures). Texts focusing on drinking cultures (bars, toasting rituals), prevention projects, family risk/protective factors, or national policy and mortality (e.g., Russia’s anti-alcohol measures) are also clearly relevant. Compound German terms such as Alkoholkonsum, alkoholische Getränke, Antialkoholkonzept, and topics where alcohol appears alongside other substances remain relevant if alcohol-specific findings or measures are included. A document is non-relevant if “alkohol” appears only in passing (e.g., a brief list item without analysis), solely as a bibliographic tag, or in unrelated acronyms/terms that resemble the keyword (e.g., ALBUS) without any alcohol-focused content. Edge cases include methodological pieces where alcohol is present only as a co-variable; these are relevant only if they report alcohol-related results, not merely mention it among many factors.
5274	familie	The user seeks scholarly resources on “family” as a social institution, including definitions, models, and comparative analyses across countries and historical periods. They want studies on family structure and change, gender roles, work–family balance, schooling, intergenerational effects (e.g., trauma and secrecy), and family policy.	A document is relevant to the query “familie” when it centrally examines family (Familie/Familien) as a social institution, unit, or lived experience—such as empirical or theoretical work on family structures and roles, intergenerational dynamics, policy, or family–work/school relations. Clear examples include studies of secrets in Holocaust survivors’ and Nazi-perpetrator families, analyses of the Japanese family in transition, discussions of Familienpolitik or Familienfreundlichkeit, or research on large families (kinderreiche Familien) and post-socialist family change in Poland or Russia. It is less relevant if “Familie” appears only tangentially (a passing mention, a proper name like “Familie X” without broader analysis), or if the main focus is another institution and family is merely listed in a table of contents. Edge cases include German compounds and inflections (Familienpolitik, Ein-Eltern-Familie, Familiengeheimnisse), which should still count, and methodological pieces (e.g., a Familienscript instrument) that address family via measurement rather than narrative. Documents in other languages or about unrelated “family” metaphors (such as a corporate “brand family”) are generally non-relevant unless they explicitly analyze human families.
5275	democracy	The user seeks an academic overview of democracy’s concepts and dimensions (e.g., electoral, liberal, direct) and how its quality is measured and compared across countries. They want reviews of measurement frameworks and indices (e.g., Freedom House, Polity IV, V-Dem), typologies and profiles of democracies, and research linking legitimacy, participation, promotion, and backsliding over time.	A document is relevant if democracy is its central subject—defining the concept, comparing models (electoral, liberal, direct), or assessing its quality through indices and audits (e.g., Freedom House, Polity IV, V-Dem, Democracy Barometer, Democracy Ranking). Empirical and theoretical works on types and trajectories of democracies (defective democracies, backsliding, waves of democratization), legitimacy and satisfaction, turnout dynamics, or democracy promotion and justice conflicts are also directly relevant, including country or period case studies like Mexico’s malaise, Germany’s party manifestos, the interwar crisis, or Czech institutional trust. Advocacy or practice-oriented materials that teach how to “speak up for democracy,” or analyses of direct versus representative mechanisms (initiatives, referendums), are relevant because they address democratic processes and norms. By contrast, texts that only mention “democracy” in passing, use it metaphorically or as a brand name, or focus purely on economics or media without linking to democratic institutions, rights, or citizen evaluations are non-relevant. Edge cases include methodological pieces (e.g., cluster analyses of democracy profiles) and historical philosophy surveys; these are relevant when they explicitly tie methods or theory to measuring, classifying, or explaining democracy.
52781	alkoholkonsum	The user seeks research-based insights on alcohol consumption, covering prevalence and trends across demographics, social and environmental determinants, and related outcomes (e.g., delinquency, health, violence), with focus on youth and military contexts and implications for prevention and policy.	A document is relevant if it analyzes alcohol consumption itself—levels, patterns, trends, or determinants—whether quantitatively (e.g., grams of pure alcohol per day, binge/episodic drinking thresholds) or qualitatively (norms, motives, contexts). Studies linking alcohol consumption to outcomes or settings—such as youth delinquency, violence, health risks, military or student subcultures, national comparisons, or policy effects like taxation and availability—are also relevant. Methodological pieces are relevant when they specifically examine drinking behavior, motives, occasions, or group norms (including religiously motivated abstinence); edge cases include fieldwork reflections where alcohol shapes interviews, which are weakly relevant unless they discuss consumption patterns rather than mere etiquette. Non-relevant documents only mention alcohol in passing, focus on other drugs without a clear alcohol link, or discuss “risk behavior” generically without detailing drinking. Items using synonymous terms (risky drinking, binge drinking/Rauschtrinken), comparing subgroups (men vs. women, age cohorts), or presenting longitudinal survey results are highly relevant, whereas purely theoretical work that never treats alcohol consumption substantively may not be.
52895	inequality	The user seeks evidence on how actual versus perceived income inequality relate to attitudes—tolerance and support for redistribution—and whether perceptions mediate this link. They want cross-national findings on moderators like social class and fairness/inequality of opportunity, and implications for wellbeing, health, and political engagement.	A document is relevant if it substantively analyzes social or economic inequality—its levels, measurement, perceptions, causes, or effects—such as studies of income or wage inequality (e.g., using SWIID, WID, EU-SILC, ISSP), links to redistribution preferences, health inequalities, life satisfaction, or political participation, or country cases like South Africa, the OECD, or the UK. Papers that distinguish actual versus perceived inequality, or fairness concepts like inequality of opportunity versus outcome, and that examine class differences, tolerance, or mobility are also squarely on-topic. Methodological pieces that discuss how to measure inequality (e.g., Gini, pay ratios, intra-household consumption gaps) or critique data and concepts are relevant because they inform what “inequality” means and how it is assessed. Non-relevant items would be those that only mention inequality in passing, use “inequality” purely in a mathematical sense, or focus on adjacent topics (e.g., poverty, education, or redistribution) without connecting them to inequality levels or disparities. Edge cases include documents using synonyms like disparities or fairness without the keyword (still relevant), highly specialized subtypes (gender, educational, intra-household) that are relevant given the broad query, and studies on mobility or opportunity that are relevant if they explicitly tie back to inequality.
5335	social media nutzung	The user seeks an overview of research on social media usage—how platforms are adopted and shape communication and behavior. They want evidence and case studies across contexts such as political mobilization and campaigning, informal learning, labor and industry (including Industry 4.0), youth and identity, advertising, and methodological/ethical issues in social media analysis.	A document is relevant to the query “social media nutzung” if it explicitly examines how social media are used—by individuals, groups, or organizations—covering behaviors, purposes, contexts, and platforms (e.g., studies on parties and MPs using Facebook, youths’ practices on SNS, crisis communication in the Arab Spring, corporate use in Industry 4.0, or informal learning via YouTube/Instagram). Empirical evidence such as surveys, usage logs, case studies, or comparative analyses of platform practices (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest) increases relevance. Items are less relevant when social media are only tangentially mentioned or when “Nutzung” refers to something else (e.g., land-use/Flächennutzung projects that merely add a “social media service” without studying SM usage, or theoretical pieces on kybernetics/objectivation that don’t describe user behavior). Methodological or ethical discussions of social media analytics are borderline: they count if they analyze or enable interpretation of usage traces and behavior, but not if they focus solely on methods or privacy without linking to usage patterns. Similarly, advertising-spend reports or image-practice essays are relevant when they detail how advertisers or users engage with channels (e.g., preferring Instagram/YouTube for video), but not when they only list platforms or popularity rankings without describing actual use.
5377	social media use	The user seeks scholarly research on patterns, strategies, and determinants of social media use across diverse domains (e.g., newsrooms, museums, relationships, youth health, politics, disaster management, business, migration), including platform-specific differences. They want evidence on how social media use affects outcomes such as trust, participation, agenda setting, life satisfaction, revenue, sexual risk, and social cohesion, and how these effects vary by context, culture, and major events.	A document is relevant if it analyzes how people or organizations use social media—what platforms they choose (e.g., Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, TikTok), why they use them, how they engage or strategize, and with what consequences. Examples include studies of museums’ Facebook/Twitter strategies, newsrooms commodifying and distributing content via social media, youth or migrant usage patterns, disaster communication, political participation or disconnection, and using social media to recruit survey respondents. Evidence of usage can be behavioral (posting, sharing, following), strategic (team structures, targeting, agenda setting), or outcome-focused (effects on life satisfaction, trust, sexual risk, revenue, social cohesion). A document is less relevant if it only mentions “media” without addressing social networks, treats social media abstractly without describing use, or merely lists accounts without analyzing behavior; however, critiques of using social media as historical sources or analyses of non-use/disconnection can still be relevant if they examine practices around social media. Edge cases include intermedia agenda-setting papers and lifestyle politics studies, which remain relevant when they assess how social media activity shapes topics or actions, but become marginal if they discuss culture or events without linking them to actual social media use.
53774	berufsausbildung	The user seeks analyses and overviews of vocational education and training (Berufsausbildung)—primarily in Germany—including how the dual and cooperative/integrative models function, reform proposals amid technological change, and effects on study success and labor-market integration. They also want evidence on transitions from school to training and work, outcomes for disadvantaged youth, and cross-country comparisons.	A document is relevant if it substantively discusses vocational education and training in the German-speaking context, using terms like Berufsausbildung, Berufsbildung, duale Ausbildung, Lehre, Erstausbildung, or betriebliche/außerbetriebliche Ausbildung, and addresses structures, reforms, outcomes, or transitions (e.g., effects of automation on curricula, the dual system’s strengths, or employment trajectories after apprenticeship). Empirical studies, policy analyses, and comparative reports—such as longitudinal cohorts of students moving from school to VET, evaluations of integrative or cooperative VET for disadvantaged youth, or cross-country comparisons of VET organization—are clearly relevant. Content focused only on general education or university study without a meaningful link to vocational training, or texts where “Ausbildung” refers to unrelated training (military, medical residency without VET context) are non-relevant. Edge cases include documents centered on higher education but analyzing how completing a Berufsausbildung before or instead of university affects study success or job security (relevant), or pieces that use broader terms like Berufsbildung or talk about Weiterbildung where Berufsausbildung is only mentioned in passing (partially or non-relevant unless VET is a core focus). Historical and regional variants (DDR, Austria’s integrative VET, or IAB/BIBB statistics on apprenticeship markets) remain relevant when they illuminate vocational training systems, policies, or learner outcomes.
53827	berufsabschluss	The user seeks research and policy information on vocational qualifications (Berufsabschluss) in Germany, including how lacking a qualification affects employment and how employers view partially qualified workers. They also want pathways and measures to obtain or recognize qualifications—retraining, modular/partial qualifications, external exams, and recognition of foreign credentials—to address skills shortages and improve integration of migrants and other disadvantaged groups.	A document is relevant if it directly discusses vocational qualifications (Berufsabschluss) in contexts such as obtaining one (e.g., apprenticeship, Umschulung, Externenprüfung, modular Teilqualifizierung), lacking one and its labor‑market consequences, or recognizing foreign vocational credentials, including costs, funding, and employer demand. Studies, policy reports, or statistics on shares of youth without a Berufsabschluss, the role of standardization/reglementierte Berufe, or the effectiveness of programs (e.g., BBW rehabilitation leading to an anerkannten Berufsabschluss) are strong matches. Content that uses close terms like berufsqualifizierender Abschluss, anerkannter Ausbildungsberuf, or old spelling Berufsabschluß also counts; comparisons to industry certifications or “zertifizierte Spezialisten” are relevant if they clarify they are not equivalent to a recognized Berufsabschluss. By contrast, pieces that only mention “Abschluss” generically, focus solely on academic degrees without vocational linkage, or use “Abschluss” to mean completion/closing in non-education contexts are non‑relevant. Edge cases include migration/integration articles: they are relevant when they address recognition of foreign Berufsabschlüsse or access to vocational training, but weakly relevant if they discuss integration without touching credentials.
5407	medien	The user seeks scholarly overviews of “media,” covering theoretical definitions and media effects alongside how media systems and practices influence society, politics, education, and youth in the digital age. They want comparative and empirical studies (e.g., Germany, Latin America, West Africa) on mass and social media, regulation, diversity, and public opinion.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses Medien as its main topic—e.g., defining media, analyzing media systems and policies, examining media use (youth, families, education), exploring effects such as agenda setting or democratization, or theorizing media materiality and practices. Examples of strong relevance include country reports on press/radio/TV/online systems, studies of media pluralism or social media in politics, analyses of children’s TV effects and youth media habits, or theoretical pieces on digital media and intermediality. Partially relevant items are those where Medien appear as a significant section within a broader theme (such as general pedagogy or security studies) but are not the dominant focus; these may still match if the media discussion is detailed and central to the argument. Non-relevant hits include mere name drops (e.g., “Internationales Handbuch Medien” cited without discussion), organizational addresses, uses of Medien meaning “spiritual mediums” or laboratory media, or unrelated near-terms like Medizin. Because the query is broad and in German, documents using compound or specific forms—Massenmedien, soziale/digitale Medien, Medienpraktiken, Medienbildung—are also relevant when the core discussion is about media.
54621	beschäftigungsverhältnis	The user is looking for information on the concept and legal meaning of an employment relationship (Beschäftigungsverhältnis) in Germany, including its forms (e.g., regular, fixed-term, temporary agency, mini-jobs) and social insurance implications. They may also seek evidence on how labor policies and programs affect entry into, retention of, and transitions between these employment types.	A document is relevant if it substantively discusses the establishment, type, conversion, maintenance, or termination of a Beschäftigungsverhältnis (employment relationship), including legal, statistical, or policy angles, and uses that term or close synonyms such as Arbeitsverhältnis. Examples include studies on fixed-term versus permanent contracts, attempts to bundle temp agency assignments into longer employment relationships, conversions of Minijobs into sozialversicherungspflichtige Beschäftigungsverhältnisse, or models like AuB where a dual/continued employment relationship is preserved. Also relevant are evaluations of measures that directly affect employment relationships (e.g., Eingliederungszuschüsse reducing separation risks, Kurzarbeit preserving contracts, or transitions from unemployment into a regular Beschäftigungsverhältnis) where the term is explicitly addressed. Non-relevant are pieces that only discuss broad labor market trends, underemployment, or self-employment without linking to the existence, quality, or change of an employment relationship, or where the term appears merely in passing. Edge cases to include are plural/inflected forms, hyphenation variants, and near-synonyms, as well as discussions of barriers for disabled graduates entering sozialversicherungspflichtige Beschäftigung or academia’s scarcity of fixed employment; exclude materials focused solely on training or funding unless they tie back to entering, keeping, or ending a Beschäftigungsverhältnis.
54808	berufsprestige	The user seeks an overview of occupational prestige: what it is and how it is measured and compared internationally using ISCO-based scales and Wegener’s Magnitude Prestige Scale, including coding and validity issues. They also want findings on its determinants (e.g., education and parental status) and its use in research on social mobility, socioeconomic status, and career outcomes.	A document is relevant if it defines or measures Berufsprestige (occupational prestige), presents or validates prestige scales (e.g., Wegener’s Magnitude Prestigeskala, ISCO-based standards), or uses occupational prestige as a key variable in analyses of social mobility, education, class, or SES. Studies that report prestige scores for occupations, discuss coding and comparability issues (e.g., ISCO vs KldB mappings), or examine cross-national invariance and scale reliability/validity are highly relevant. Partially relevant are works that treat Berufsprestige as a secondary control or one component of a broader index (e.g., “career success” combining income, prestige, and position) or that focus on the prestige of a single occupation (e.g., physicians) without broader theorizing. Non-relevant are pieces that only discuss occupations or labor markets without prestige, use “prestige” in a non-occupational sense, or mention the term in passing without data, scale information, or analytic use. Edge cases include self-assessed versus societal prestige, parent’s occupation prestige as a background variable, or methodological papers on converting datasets to prestige scales—these are relevant if they address measurement or application of Berufsprestige explicitly.
54995	arbeitgeber	The user seeks an overview of employers (Arbeitgeber) in Germany and their role in the labor market. They want information on legal and policy obligations and interactions, including training/apprenticeship levies, social insurance contributions, and relations with unions and public agencies.	A document is relevant to the query “arbeitgeber” if it primarily discusses employers in a German context—such as their legal obligations, costs, strategies, or relationships—using the term “Arbeitgeber” as a central concept. Examples include analyses of an Ausbildungsabgabe for firms that do not train apprentices, studies of the Bundesagentur für Arbeit’s employer services, research on employer associations and collective bargaining, comparisons of public vs. private employers, or discussions of employer social insurance contributions and wage-setting practices. Content centered mainly on employees or unions is only relevant if it explicitly examines employers’ decisions or roles (e.g., how employers’ hiring behavior affects long-term unemployment); mere passing mentions of “Arbeitgeber,” appearances in author affiliations, or generic labor-market overviews without employer-focused analysis are non-relevant. Edge cases that should count as relevant include sector-specific employers (e.g., church welfare organizations), international comparisons where “employers” are substantively analyzed even if the term appears in translation, and legal summaries where “Arbeitgeber” is a defined party with duties or exemptions. Conversely, documents focused solely on jobseeker services, macroeconomic trends, or worker rights without detailing employer actions, incentives, or regulations should be considered non-relevant.
55053	arbeit zufriedenheit	The user wants studies and survey results on “work satisfaction,” encompassing both job/working-condition satisfaction among various groups and public satisfaction with the work of the German federal government and political developments over time. They seek comparative findings across policy areas and regions (including the former GDR) and insights into key determinants of satisfaction.	For the query “arbeit zufriedenheit,” documents are relevant when they address job or work satisfaction in the sense of employees’ or trainees’ attitudes toward their work, often using terms like Arbeitszufriedenheit, Berufszufriedenheit, or Zufriedenheit mit den Arbeitsbedingungen, including facets such as pay, job security, supervision, colleague relations, workload, and work-life balance. Examples include surveys of young workers’ satisfaction with working and living conditions, studies of early-career academics’ satisfaction with employment conditions and supervision, analyses of apprentices’ satisfaction with vocational training, or research on police presenteeism that measures satisfaction with colleagues as a work-related factor. Documents are non-relevant when “Arbeit” refers to the work or performance of institutions (e.g., the work of the federal government) or when the focus is political or general life satisfaction (democracy satisfaction, satisfaction with policy developments) without a direct link to people’s satisfaction with their own jobs. Edge cases: pieces that discuss labor market policy or political outlooks are not relevant unless they explicitly measure workers’ job satisfaction; conversely, studies where work-life balance or supervisor evaluation is examined as a determinant of job satisfaction are relevant. Language, time period, or region (e.g., DDR-era youth vs. contemporary workers) does not affect relevance if the core construct is satisfaction with one’s work or working conditions.
55130	arbeitsbedingungen	The user is seeking information on working conditions, including how they are measured and compared across countries and sectors, key disparities and determinants, and policies or strategies to improve job quality. They may also want sector-specific insights (e.g., healthcare, academia, journalism, manufacturing) and the impacts of digitalization, employment forms, and social policy on workers’ well-being.	A document is relevant if it explicitly analyzes, measures, or compares Arbeitsbedingungen—such as building indicators from the European Working Conditions Survey, examining working time (duration, timing, flexibility), pay, workload, autonomy, or safety, and linking these to satisfaction, health, or inequality. Sector- or institution-specific studies qualify when they describe how conditions are structured or changing (e.g., Green Jobs, hospitals under DRGs, church employment via the Dritter Weg, cleaning work, journalism, academia, or industrial settings), including differences by gender, contract type, or country. Policy and governance pieces are relevant when they show how collective bargaining, social policy, digitization, or union campaigns shape or improve working conditions, or when they compare “quality of work” across nations using composite indicators. Documents are non-relevant if they only mention the term in passing, focus solely on income, employment levels, or abstract legal/organizational issues without concrete implications for conditions, or discuss family policy without linking it to workplace arrangements. Edge cases include texts using near-synonyms (quality of work, humanization of labor, work organization) that remain relevant if they detail impacts on workers, and working-time studies that are borderline unless they connect scheduling, abnormality, or flexibility to broader conditions.
55226	arbeitsbelastung	The query seeks research on Arbeitsbelastung (work-related load/stress), including how physical and psychosocial demands are measured and how prevalent they are across occupations. It also aims to understand their health and performance impacts (e.g., burnout, sickness absence/presenteeism) and what organizational or occupational-safety interventions can mitigate them.	A document is relevant to the query “arbeitsbelastung” when it analyzes or describes job-related demands or strains on workers—physical or psychosocial—including their measurement (e.g., validated scales or factor-analytic questionnaires), determinants (shift work, reorganization, staffing levels), prevalence across occupations, and consequences such as burnout, presenteeism, absenteeism, or health outcomes. Empirical studies that quantify workload indices (e.g., ABphy/ABpsy), evaluate interventions or organizational changes (e.g., nursing reorganization reducing task load but increasing emotional exhaustion), or link flexible work forms to strain are highly relevant. Methodological pieces that develop short instruments or indices to capture Arbeitsbelastung are relevant because they operationalize the concept. A document is non-relevant if it uses “Arbeitsbelastung” only as a passing label or metaphor, discusses institutional “workload” without reference to employees’ strain or health, or focuses on unrelated “loads” (e.g., environmental burdens) without tying them to work demands. Edge cases include sectors like public administration or education: they are relevant if they connect high workload to staff well-being or performance, and borderline if the term appears only in keywords with no substantive analysis.
55428	arbeit	The user seeks sociological research on “Arbeit” (work) that examines evolving definitions and forms of work—such as knowledge, emotional, cooperative, and biographical labor—along with entgrenzung, technological change, and blurred work–life boundaries. They also want analyses of work quality, health and violence links, and the political, gender, educational, and professionalization implications for modern labor.	A document is relevant to the query “arbeit” when it substantively discusses work/labor in the German context—such as employment, labor organization, social work, or theories of work—and uses the term “Arbeit” or close morphological variants. Compounds and derivatives like Arbeitswelt, Wissensarbeit, Soziale Arbeit, Entgrenzung der Arbeit, Arbeitssucht, or indices like Gute Arbeit indicate strong relevance because they center on work concepts, conditions, or policies. By contrast, incidental or boilerplate mentions, occurrences only in metadata, or substring matches where “arbeit” appears inside words without a labor-related meaning (e.g., Bearbeitung for generic “processing,” or a proper name/URL) are weakly or non-relevant unless the surrounding context ties them to labor. Edge cases include broadened theoretical uses such as Emotionsarbeit or biographische Arbeit, which are still relevant because they conceptualize forms of work, whereas idiomatic quotes or passing mentions without analysis are not. Documents in other languages that only use “work” would typically be non-relevant for the exact keyword unless the system applies synonym or translation expansion; conversely, high density of “Arbeit” across headings and analysis suggests strong relevance.
56089	arbeitsleistung	The user seeks information on Arbeitsleistung (work performance): its definition, assessment, incentives, and compensation across organizational and policy contexts. They want to understand how factors like age, gender, work design (e.g., home office), health interventions, and evolving employment models influence performance and its recognition.	A document is relevant if it directly analyzes, measures, regulates, or empirically reports on Arbeitsleistung (work performance), for example studies on age and performance, wellbeing interventions that change performance, home-office intensity and performance, gender bias in performance evaluation, or labor-law/collective agreements that reduce or reallocate required work performance (e.g., partial release from duties, unpaid overtime of physicians). Content that models or steers performance (shirking models, hierarchical control, seniority promotions, crowdsourcing that reorganizes how performance is produced and rewarded) is also relevant, as are sectoral cases (farmers’ high workload, foreign correspondents’ performance constraints) when they explain drivers, measurement, or consequences of performance. Documents are non-relevant if they only mention the term in passing, or discuss adjacent topics like working time, employment status, or retirement without tying them to performance outputs, evaluation, productivity, or management of performance. Edge cases include macro-level uses (societal “allocation of Arbeitsleistungen”), plural or related terms (Leistungsbeurteilung, Leistungsfähigkeit, Produktivität), and normative debates; these remain relevant when they inform how performance is defined, assessed, or influenced. Conversely, general wellbeing or organizational culture pieces are only relevant if they establish a concrete linkage to changes in Arbeitsleistung.
56202	arbeitsbelastungen	The query seeks research on occupational workloads in Germany—types and prevalence of physical and psychosocial job demands, how they are measured, and how work organization (e.g., shift work, flexible contracts, reorganization) influences them. It also aims to understand their health impacts (burnout, stress, absenteeism/presenteeism) and implications for integrating these issues into occupational safety and prevention policies.	A document is relevant if it substantively investigates Arbeitsbelastungen—physical or psychosocial work burdens, quantitative/qualitative workload, or stressors—by describing their measurement, prevalence, determinants (e.g., shift work, reorganization, flexible contracts), or consequences (e.g., burnout, absenteeism/presenteeism, health risks). Examples of strong relevance include multi-industry surveys on employees’ exposures and OSH policy responses, hospital nursing studies linking reorganization to workload and burnout, validated indices or short instruments for assessing Arbeitsbelastung (e.g., ABges/ABphy/ABpsy, KFZA), and analyses of sector-specific burdens (police, service sector, older workers). Documents are non-relevant when “Arbeitsbelastung” is only mentioned in passing while the focus lies elsewhere (e.g., political education in schools or municipal offices’ performance without real analysis of work strain), or when content is a broad A&O psychology overview that doesn’t address workload explicitly. Edge cases: historical accounts of factory work or early surveys are relevant if they analyze workload/strain dimensions; youth or general health surveys are partially relevant if they include a dedicated section on working respondents’ burdens; studies on social support and stress count if they explicitly tie effects to chronic work-related burdens, but narratives about personal career changes with incidental “new workloads” do not.
56749	antisemitism	The user seeks an evidence-based overview of antisemitism’s historical roots and contemporary manifestations, prevalence, and trends—especially across Europe—drawing on surveys, case studies, and new research frameworks. They also want to understand key drivers (e.g., religion, education, migration, populism), contexts like online hate speech and schools, and the policy and educational responses to address it.	A document is relevant if it substantively examines antisemitism—its prevalence, causes, forms, measurements, or impacts—such as national case studies (e.g., Poland or Hungary), large-scale surveys (Eurobarometer, FRA, German Integrationsbarometer), analyses of online hate speech (Decoding Antisemitism), or frameworks and datasets (e.g., DIMA). Research on education and lived experience (e.g., Jewish students in schools) or on long-run consequences of historical antisemitism (e.g., effects on financial behavior) is also relevant, as are pieces that debate the concept’s meaning, politicization, or its relationship to other prejudices. Documents are non-relevant when they only mention the term in passing, use “antisemitic” metaphorically without addressing Jew-hatred, focus solely on other forms of bias without linking them to antisemitism, or discuss the Holocaust/WWII without engaging antisemitism as a phenomenon. Edge cases include materials that contain antisemitic rhetoric: these can be relevant as evidence or examples if documented and analyzed, though some systems may exclude them for safety; likewise, studies on xenophobia or right-wing populism are relevant only when they explicitly connect those trends to antisemitism.
57292	ausländer	The user seeks research-based information on foreigners in Germany, focusing on determinants of public attitudes and xenophobia, integration outcomes, and the role of intergroup contact versus competition, primarily using ALLBUS survey data, with relevant policy context.	A document is relevant if it centers on Ausländer (foreigners/foreign nationals), for example analyzing attitudes toward foreigners in Germany, integration processes, rights and legal status, demographic patterns, or theories like group threat, relative deprivation, social identity, and the contact hypothesis. Highly relevant examples include ALLBUS-based studies of xenophobia in 2016 showing contact effects and East–West differences, evaluations of support for equal rights or municipal voting rights for foreigners, and discussions of contact with foreigners in family, neighborhood, and workplaces. Non-relevant or weakly relevant items include content about Ausland (abroad) such as Germans emigrating, or BND “Ausland-Ausland” surveillance law, where the word “Ausländer” may appear but the core topic is emigration or telecommunications policy rather than foreigners as a social group. Edge cases include edited volumes that merely list “Ausländer” among many themes (only marginally relevant), or texts using near-synonyms (Migranten, ausländische Staatsbürger) or gendered/plural forms (Ausländerinnen und Ausländer)—these are relevant when the substantive focus remains on foreigners. Materials on vocational training, media, or education are relevant if they specifically analyze or target foreigners; generic mentions without sustained analysis are not.
5736	wohlfahrtsstaat	The user seeks an academic overview of the welfare state—its conceptual and constitutional foundations and “theory deficit,” key legitimations and critiques, and its social and economic impacts. They want comparative and empirical evidence across countries and contexts (market efficiency, freedom, inclusion, globalization, gender, public acceptance, crime risk, democracy, and historical cases).	A document is relevant if it treats the Wohlfahrtsstaat (welfare state) as a political-institutional arrangement or policy regime, discussing its theories, legitimacy, expansion or retrenchment, and comparative performance. Examples of relevance include cross-national comparisons (e.g., Sweden/Netherlands vs. USA/Japan), debates over freedom, efficiency, and inclusion, empirical work on public acceptance, globalization’s impact, gendered outcomes, or sectoral analyses of housing, education, and health explicitly framed as features of the welfare state. Historical and constitutional treatments (such as the Nazi welfare state, or arguments about the Sozialstaat’s legal basis) and discourse-analytic pieces on the semantics of the welfare state also qualify. Edge cases: texts using synonyms or variants (Sozialstaat, wohlfahrtsstaatlich) are relevant, while items about generic “welfare” or charity (Wohlfahrt), private philanthropy, or brand names like Käthe Wohlfahrt are not. Content on crime, immigration, or budgets is only relevant if it explicitly links these outcomes to welfare-state design, functions, or legitimacy; otherwise it should be considered non-relevant.
57703	arbeitsweg	The user is seeking research and statistics on work commutes, including travel time and distance trends, factors shaping mode choice and willingness to commute or relocate, and how patterns differ by gender, family situation, and urban–rural context in Germany.	A document is relevant to the query “arbeitsweg” if it focuses on the commute to work, such as discussing commute time or distance, commuting patterns (e.g., rising shares of 25+ km trips), mode choice on the way to work, or factors shaping commuting for specific groups like dual‑career couples or gender differences. Studies that analyze willingness to accept a long commute when job searching, the impact of corporate relocations on employees’ travel to work, or interventions promoting sustainable modes for the work trip also count as relevant. Content that only mentions “Arbeitsweg” in passing within a broader, unrelated topic (e.g., fertility or life‑satisfaction surveys where commute length is just one of many variables) is only marginally relevant. Edge cases include documents using synonyms like “Pendeln” or “Weg zur Arbeit,” which should be treated as relevant, while texts about school commutes or household/child‑related trips without clear linkage to the work commute are non‑relevant. International cases (e.g., East Midlands in England) can still be relevant if the focus is the daily commute to work rather than the locale.
58154	gesundheitszustand	The user is seeking research and statistics on health status—particularly in Germany—how it is measured, its trends, and how it varies by age, gender, socioeconomic status, family structure, and employment. They also want insights into implications for working beyond retirement and for reducing health inequalities in public health policy.	A document is relevant if it directly examines, measures, or analyzes Gesundheitszustand (health status) in individuals or populations, whether objectively (medical assessments, morbidity) or subjectively (self-rated health), including determinants, trends, and disparities. Examples include analyses of older adults’ willingness to work by health status, EU-SILC or KiGGS findings on self-rated health and chronic limitations by income, education, or employment, cohort or longitudinal results (e.g., Bonner gerontological study), and migration patterns like the “healthy migrant effect.” Methodological pieces that define or critique how health status is measured (e.g., healthy life expectancy/GLE and its sensitivity to definitions and data sources) are also relevant. A document is non-relevant if it only mentions health status in passing as context (e.g., as one of many recruitment risks for the military) or focuses solely on behaviors/policies without linking them to measured or explicitly discussed health status. Edge cases such as discussions of personal responsibility in aging or socioeconomic status and family structure are relevant when they present data or analysis tying these factors to subjective/objective health status, but not when they are purely anecdotal or theoretical.
5830	politisches wissen	The query seeks research-based insight into “political knowledge”: how it is objectively defined and measured, how it is distributed across groups in Germany, and which factors (ability, education, motivation, media, region, language) shape it. It also asks how political knowledge affects trust, populism, and participation, drawing largely on ALLBUS 2008/2018 findings and implying implications for civic education.	A document is relevant if it explicitly defines, measures, or analyzes political knowledge (politisches Wissen) as a concept or variable, including its determinants, distribution, and consequences. Strong signals include distinctions between knowledge and beliefs or attitudes, operationalizations of objective/factual knowledge versus self-assessed competence, and empirical studies (e.g., ALLBUS 2008/2018, school assessments like POWIS, EU election studies) linking political knowledge to outcomes such as participation, trust in institutions, or susceptibility to populism, as well as findings on media use, education/IQ, regional differences, or youth cohorts. Methodological discussions (measurement models, item batteries, structural equation modeling, eye-tracking of information search) and debates on civic education or the role of mass media in building political knowledge also count as clearly relevant when tied to knowledge acquisition or effects. By contrast, documents that discuss politics, political trust, or participation without conceptualizing or measuring political knowledge, use “wissen” only as a verb or in unrelated domains (e.g., scientific knowledge, epistemology), or offer purely normative commentary without engaging the knowledge construct are non-relevant. Edge cases include pieces on media literacy or economic insecurity that only mention knowledge in passing (marginal), and subgroup-specific studies (e.g., migrants, fifth graders, East–West) which are relevant when they explicitly assess political knowledge levels, determinants, or impacts.
5843	populism	The user seeks scholarly explanations and definitions of populism, comparing conceptual approaches (e.g., ideology vs strategy) and clarifying its core features. They also want analysis of populism’s relationship with democracy—its potential benefits, risks, and how to distinguish it from ordinary democratic contestation.	A document is relevant if it directly analyzes populism as a political phenomenon—its definitions, ideology, strategies, actors, rhetoric, or its relationship with democracy and institutions. For example, works that compare minimal definitions of populism (e.g., Mudde’s thin-centered ideology vs. Weyland’s strategy) or that examine how populism affects or corrects democratic practice are clearly on-topic. By contrast, texts about population demography—fertility, mortality, migration, gridded population datasets, urbanization, or “population transition” in countries—are non-relevant despite lexical overlap with “populism.” Edge cases include discussions of “population” in governmentality (e.g., Foucault) or uses of “popular”/“the people” that do not engage the populism literature; these should be treated as non-relevant unless they explicitly frame arguments around populism. Interdisciplinary studies (e.g., immigration levels, group threat, or trust) are relevant only if they explicitly link findings to populist parties, attitudes, or rhetoric; otherwise they remain demographic or sociological, not populism-focused.
58596	gesundheit arbeit	The user seeks research-based insights on how employment status and workplace conditions influence health, including subjective and mental health. They likely want studies, reports, and policies on occupational health risks, sector- and gender-specific factors, and interventions to improve healthy work environments.	A document is relevant if it analyzes the relationship between work and health—such as how employment status, working conditions, job control, shift work, or occupational safety influence physical, mental, or subjective health. Examples include studies comparing unemployed vs. employed people’s self-rated health, research linking low autonomy or monotonous industrial work to psychosomatic disorders, reports on caregivers’ burdens and health outcomes, or surveys like lidA and insurer reports tracking sickness absence in workplaces. Policy and organizational pieces are also relevant when they address workplace health management, gender in work and health, or climate-related heat risks at work, and dataset descriptions qualify if they include both work variables and health measures. Non-relevant items are those that discuss health without any tie to employment (e.g., medical history or genetic risk discourses) or talk about “Arbeit” as an academic thesis or generic “work” unrelated to employment or workplaces. Edge cases include documents focused mainly on education, social status, or environmental awareness; these are only relevant if they explicitly connect those topics to workers’ health or occupational conditions.
59281	geschlechterrolle	The query seeks scholarly research on gender roles and attitudes—their determinants, cross-national differences, and changes over time—especially how gender, religion, socioeconomic context, and policy shape family and work divisions. It emphasizes empirical studies using large surveys (e.g., ALLBUS, ISSP, EUREQUAL, FReDA) in Germany, Eastern Europe, and other contexts.	A document is relevant if it substantively examines gender roles (Geschlechterrolle/Geschlechterrollen/Geschlechtsrollen/Rollenbilder) as social expectations or norms, including attitudes toward them, their determinants, and their evolution in family, labor, education, or public life. Empirical studies using survey data (e.g., ALLBUS, ISSP, EUREQUAL, FReDA) on topics like the division of housework, views on maternal employment, East–West differences in Germany, post-communist trends, or campus negotiations of masculinity/femininity count as strongly relevant. Theoretical or feminist-psychology works that define concepts (such as gender code vs. role), analyze stereotypes, and link gender roles to outcomes like leadership, wellbeing, or policy are also relevant. Edge cases include historical or cultural analyses (e.g., motherhood debates, militarization in Serbia, or antisemitism framed through differing gender-role projections) that are relevant when gender roles are a central analytic lens but less so if the term appears only in passing. Non-relevant items are those that use “role” in non-gender senses, focus solely on grammatical gender or biological sex without social role expectations, or discuss gender equality broadly without analyzing role norms or the gendered division of labor.
59288	geschlechterrollen	The user is seeking scholarly analyses of gender roles and attitudes, including how they vary and change across countries and over time. They want studies on determinants such as gender, socioeconomic context, region, religion, and socialization, and their implications for family/work division of labor, using survey datasets (e.g., EUREQUAL, ALLBUS, ISSP, FReDA).	A document is relevant if it primarily analyzes, defines, measures, or debates Geschlechterrollen (gender roles), such as norms and expectations around family and paid work, gendered division of labor, or attitudes toward women’s and men’s roles. Strong examples include empirical studies using surveys like ALLBUS, ISSP, FReDA, or EUREQUAL to examine determinants and trends in gender-role attitudes (e.g., working motherhood in East vs. West Germany, post-communist Eastern Europe), as well as research on socialization, stereotypes, or policy impacts on role expectations. Theoretical or historical works from feminist perspectives and context-specific case studies (e.g., universities in Tanzania, Serbia’s post-socialist shifts) are relevant when they explicitly link behaviors, conflicts, or institutions to gender-role norms. Non-relevant items are those that only mention the term in passing, focus strictly on biological sex differences or cognitive traits without connecting them to social roles, or use “Rolle” metaphorically (e.g., theatrical roles). Edge cases include multi-topic studies (e.g., religion, work ethic, mobility/time use) where gender roles are just one dimension; these are relevant only if they directly analyze how role expectations shape the observed outcomes.
60378	führungsstil	The user seeks information on leadership style—its definitions and typologies—and how different styles (e.g., participative vs. hierarchical) vary across contexts such as academia, public administration, education, and politics, with a focus on gender differences and their effects on performance, careers, and organizational change.	A document is relevant if it defines, analyzes, compares, or empirically investigates Führungsstil (leadership style), whether in universities, public administration, classrooms, politics, or business. Clear examples include studies on gendered leadership styles in academia or social work, research linking teachers’ leadership styles to classroom interaction and learning, or biographies that explicitly examine a politician’s style (e.g., Angela Merkel’s moderating approach or Ernst Albrecht’s leadership). Also relevant are diagnoses of leadership deficits and modernization strategies that hinge on leadership style, or public-sector and entrepreneurship studies where supervisors’ Führungsstil affects participation, job security, or performance. A document is non-relevant if it uses the term only in passing as a label without substantive discussion, or focuses on unrelated history or careers without analyzing leadership behavior; borderline cases that use near-synonyms like Führungsverhalten, Leitungsstil/Leitungsaufgaben, or Klassenführung remain relevant if they connect to style constructs. Critiques that question the notion of a distinct “female leadership style” are still pertinent because they directly engage the concept, whereas texts about discrimination or career paths that never address how leadership is enacted are less relevant.
6086	refugee	The user seeks a comprehensive, research-based overview of refugees that covers legal definitions and critiques, asylum and humanitarian practices, host–refugee relations, and integration outcomes across regions. It emphasizes critical refugee studies and empirical evidence on attitudes, aid, networks, and the lived experiences of specific groups such as women, LGBTQ+, and environmental refugees.	A document is relevant if it centers on people with or claiming refugee status, their protection and rights, the institutions and laws that govern asylum, or their lived experiences of displacement, settlement, and integration. Studies of host–refugee relations in camps (e.g., Kakuma), UNHCR registration practices in Thailand/Malaysia, host-society attitudes in Lebanon or Germany, policy assessments (such as Uganda’s self-reliance model or France’s pandemic-era asylum adjustments), and group-specific analyses (Kurds, Oromo, Tamil, women, LGBTQ refugees) are clearly relevant. Pieces that theorize or represent refugee experience—Critical Refugee Studies, analyses of refugee photography, or work on militarized refugees and conflict diffusion—also qualify when refugees remain the primary focus; debates on “environmental refugees” are relevant despite legal contestation. Non-relevant items use “refugee” only metaphorically, mention it in passing, or discuss migration, labor markets, or border control in general without substantive refugee-specific content or distinctions. Edge cases include asylum seekers and IDPs (relevant when compared or linked to refugee frameworks), and methodological or conceptual critiques that depart from the 1951 Convention but still engage directly with refugee categories, rights, or experiences.
60915	führungskräfte	Research-based insights on managers/executives (Führungskräfte) in Germany, including part-time leadership feasibility, health and job demands/resources, gender disparities and stereotypes, competencies and learning, and recruitment and career patterns. Emphasis on cultural and organizational determinants, work–family balance, and comparative findings across age groups, regions, and countries.	A document is relevant if it directly examines Führungskräfte (managers/executives) as a distinct group—their roles, conditions, competencies, behaviors, or outcomes—such as studies on part‑time feasibility and rates among executives, health and workload patterns of supervisors versus non-leaders, gender bias toward female managers, recruitment and retention of Fach- und Führungskräfte, or age differences in learning strategies. Empirical analyses using datasets (e.g., ALLBUS, PIAAC), organizational case studies, or models that explain determinants of leadership practice (e.g., culture, job demands-resources) are strong signals of relevance, including work on measurement instruments validated with German Führungskräfte. Documents are non-relevant when “Führungskräfte” is only mentioned in passing while the focus is the general workforce, when leadership is discussed purely abstractly without anchoring to people in managerial positions, or when the topic concerns unrelated “Führungs-” terms (e.g., certificates) or entirely different domains. Edge cases include mixed-sample studies: they are relevant if they report separate results for managers or derive manager-specific implications, and sector-specific leadership (universities, public administration, education) also counts if it centers on those leaders. Research about managers’ family/partner dynamics can be relevant when it analyzes work–family interfaces for Führungskräfte, but becomes less relevant if it focuses primarily on partners without managerial insights.
6092	refugees	The user seeks a synthesized overview of refugee studies, including critical theory and legal frameworks, host-country policies and attitudes, protection challenges and abuses, and mechanisms of identification and aid. They want comparative, evidence-based insights on integration and social cohesion across contexts and groups (e.g., women, LGBTQ, environmental refugees) with case studies from Europe, Africa, and Asia.	A document is relevant if it centers refugees as the main subject—law, policy, protection, lived experience, or specific communities—and treats the topic with substantive analysis or evidence. Examples include studies of host–refugee relations in Kakuma camp, UNHCR registration practices in Thailand/Malaysia, attitudes toward refugees in Germany or Lebanon, accounts of refoulement and forced recruitment in West Africa, or integration and labor-market outcomes in Germany, Greece, Uganda, France, and the Netherlands; theoretical work in Critical Refugee Studies and focused topics on refugee women or LGBTQ refugees are also clearly relevant. Non-relevant items would only mention refugees in passing, conflate them entirely with general migration without distinguishing legal status, use “refuge” metaphorically, or discuss unrelated humanitarian issues without a refugee focus. Edge cases include work on asylum seekers, IDPs, or “environmental refugees,” and visual/representational studies; these are relevant when they explicitly connect findings to refugee status, rights, governance, or lived experiences, but less so when the link is tenuous.
61220	führungskraft	The user seeks an overview of the role of a Führungskraft (manager/leader). They want research-based insights on competencies, part-time feasibility, health and workload, gender dynamics and stereotypes, training/learning, recruitment, and work–life balance, especially in Germany and in international comparison.	For the query “führungskraft,” a document is relevant if it focuses on people in leadership or managerial roles in organizations and explicitly uses the term or close German synonyms. Highly relevant examples include studies on part-time work among Führungskräfte, analyses of their health and work demands, research on gender biases toward female Führungskräfte, discussions of leadership competencies and training, or tools for leadership categorization. Documents are non-relevant when “Führung” is used in other senses (e.g., guided tours, Führungszeugnis, Führungsschiene) or when “Kraft” refers to strength/energy, or when Führungskräfte are only mentioned in passing within a general workforce piece. Edge cases that should still count as relevant include texts using synonyms like leitende Angestellte, Vorgesetzte, Manager, Top-Management, or sector-specific leaders (e.g., pädagogische Führungskräfte), as well as spelling variants like Fuehrungskraft and the plural Führungskräfte. Conversely, very abstract leadership essays that never address the roles, conditions, or competencies of managers in practice may be marginal for a keyword targeting the German term.
61312	führung	The user is seeking comprehensive information on “Führung” (leadership), including core theories, models, and empirical research, and how leadership operates across management, education, military (Innere Führung), and political contexts. Key interests include cooperative leadership, gender dynamics, organizational learning and change, and European case studies (EU, Germany, Russia).	For the query “führung” (leadership/management), a document is relevant if it explicitly analyzes leadership as a concept, practice, or role—such as summaries of leadership theories and styles, studies of cooperative leadership in organizations or EU politics, research on the Bundeswehr’s Innere Führung, or examinations of leadership in arts contexts (e.g., orchestras) and in socio-digital transformation. Empirical work on gender and leadership, university rector leadership using the Full Range of Leadership model, Delphi studies on top executives, or organizational learning and leadership in schools and nonprofits also qualifies. Historical-political analyses that scrutinize how national or party leadership operates and shapes outcomes (e.g., Italian prime-ministerial leadership, Russian/Belarusian state leadership, leadership changes in post-DDR transitions) are relevant when they treat leadership as a causal or structural variable. Non-relevant would be items where “Führung” is only a passing mention (a tagline, list entry, or proverb), or where it means something else (a guided tour, a technical guide/rail) without substantive leadership content. Edge cases: fixed terms like Innere Führung are still relevant; studies of “führerlose Gruppen” are relevant if they analyze the absence of leadership as a leadership construct; brief newsy mentions of a leader without analysis are likely non-relevant.
61531	geschlecht und geschlechterrollen	The query seeks scholarly information on gender and gender roles, focusing on their social construction, feminist critiques, socialization, stereotypes, and the gendered division of labor. It also looks for comparative and longitudinal analyses of attitudes and policies across contexts (e.g., Germany, Serbia, Japan, Eastern Europe) and their impact on work, family, and equality.	A document is relevant if it examines gender as a social category and explicitly analyzes gender roles—how they are constructed, enacted, or changing—such as feminist critiques of psychology, studies of socialization of boys and girls, stereotypes, division of labor, or time-use patterns that differ by gender. Empirical work using surveys (e.g., ALLBUS, ISSP, EUREQUAL) or case studies (East/West Germany, Serbia’s post-socialist transition, Japan–Germany comparisons) that measure attitudes toward maternal employment, retraditionalization, or “doing/undoing gender” in everyday practices also fits well. Thematic lenses like media representation of women leaders, right-wing party gender ideologies, or intersections with antisemitism are relevant when they tie differences in content or behavior to gender roles and their reproduction or contestation. Non-relevant items would be pieces that only treat Geschlecht as a biological variable without discussing roles, generic equality statements with no analysis of role expectations, or tangential references where “gender” appears but role norms are not a focus; duplicate summaries add little additional value. Edge cases include works using variant terminology (Geschlechtsrollen), studies focused on a single subgroup or setting (e.g., cemeteries) that still analyze role performance, and theoretical pieces on technoscience and gender identities that connect to the loosening of rigid roles.
61686	gender role attitudes	The user seeks comparative research on how individual and societal gender role attitudes—including their level, consistency, and polarization—shape fertility and childlessness, marital attitudes, and women’s labor supply across countries and over time. They also want to understand how policy contexts, modernization, and regional differences moderate these relationships.	A document is relevant if it explicitly measures or analyzes gender role attitudes—e.g., traditional vs. egalitarian views—and how these attitudes vary across individuals, regions, or time, or how they relate to outcomes like fertility, labor supply, marriage, or childlessness. Studies that construct indices from surveys (ISSP, EVS, ALLBUS), compare East–West contexts, examine polarization or dispersion of attitudes, or test multilevel effects of individual attitudes and societal norms all directly match the query. Papers focusing only on gendered behaviors, policies, or labor-market outcomes without assessing attitudes, or that discuss gender identity or schema theory without linking to gender role attitudes, would be non-relevant. Edge cases include work on “social norms” that does not measure attitudes but is tightly tied to them (often still relevant), and single-country case studies or methodological pieces that focus on how to measure gender role attitudes (relevant if attitudes are central, less so if they only mention the term in passing).
61734	gender role	The user is seeking scholarly research on gender roles—how gender role attitudes are conceptualized and measured, how they vary across societies and over time, and which factors (e.g., education, religiosity, policy) shape them. They also want evidence on how these beliefs affect outcomes like relationship satisfaction, fertility, and behavior, and implications for family therapy and gender equality policy.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses gender roles as social norms, stereotypes, attitudes, or behaviors assigned to men and women, such as traditional vs. egalitarian beliefs, male breadwinner/female homemaker expectations, or role orientations (e.g., androgyny), and links them to outcomes like relationship satisfaction, fertility, education, or therapy. Studies that operationalize or measure gender role attitudes (indices, multidimensional scales), compare societies or time (ISSP, EVS, cross-national analyses), or propose frameworks like CAGRIC are highly relevant. Papers that discuss “the role of gender” only as a predictor (e.g., whether men and women differ in math scores) without engaging social role expectations, or focus purely on biological sex differences or general gender equality without a role-attitude dimension, are not relevant. Edge cases include content using synonyms like gender norms, household labor division, or sex-role identity (Bem) which are typically relevant; by contrast, mentions of “role models” or “role of gender” phrased generically can be false positives unless they analyze gender role expectations.
61761	gender roles	Find research on gender role attitudes and norms—how they are measured and differ across societies—and their effects on interpersonal, family, and demographic outcomes (e.g., relationship satisfaction, fertility, academic behavior). Include multidimensional measurement approaches (beyond traditional–egalitarian scales) and implications for couple/family therapy and social policy.	A document is relevant if it directly examines gender roles as norms, attitudes, or expectations and their effects, such as studies using ISSP or EVS data to compare traditional versus egalitarian views, or frameworks like CAGRIC linking gender role beliefs and behaviors to relationship satisfaction. Papers that measure multidimensional role expectations (e.g., male breadwinner, female homemaker, female earner) or track determinants and change over time (education, religiosity, employment, policy regimes) are also relevant, including methodological work on cross-national measurement equivalence of gender role attitudes. Non-relevant items are pieces about gender equality or gender differences that never address role norms (e.g., performance gaps without linking to role attitudes) or texts that only mention “gender roles” in passing without analysis. Edge cases include research on gender role identity or sex-typed identities (relevant if tied to role beliefs/behaviors), non-English abstracts that centrally analyze gender roles, duplicated summaries, and domain-specific outcomes like academic procrastination or fertility when gender role orientations are explicit predictors. Overall, priority goes to empirical or theoretical treatments that classify, measure, or explain gender role norms and their social consequences, especially those moving beyond a single liberal–conservative scale.
6177	erziehung	The user seeks German-focused scholarly resources on Erziehung (education/child-rearing), spanning theoretical frameworks and sociological perspectives alongside practical issues like school–family–youth services cooperation, selection, inequality, gender, multiculturalism, and the public–private division of educational responsibility.	A document is relevant if it substantively discusses Erziehung (upbringing/education as a pedagogical practice or system), for example studies of Hilfen zur Erziehung, Heimerziehung, cooperation between youth welfare and schools, or theoretical treatments like Luhmann’s Erziehungssystem or Weber’s views on Erziehung within authority and culture. Compound and closely related terms (Erziehungssystem, öffentliche Erziehung, Erziehungswissenschaft, Erziehungsnotstand) and analyses contrasting Erziehung with Bildung also indicate strong relevance. Content that only mentions Erziehung in passing—such as a table of contents listing many topics, a brief media reference like “Super Nanny,” or a policy piece where Erziehung is peripheral—would be weakly relevant. Edge cases include works focused mainly on Bildung: they are relevant only if they explicitly tie schooling or socialization to Erziehung, and items about discrimination or gender are relevant when framed as “Erziehung gegen Rassismus” or gender in Erziehung rather than general sociology. Mentions limited to quotations, metadata, or unrelated senses (e.g., animal training) should be considered non-relevant.
6213	religionszugehörigkeit	The user is seeking empirical research and data on religious affiliation in Germany—its distribution and how it correlates (and sometimes fails to predict) religiosity, attitudes, and behaviors (e.g., civic engagement, diversity views, family and political outcomes), including among youth, refugees, and across regions and denominations. The aim is to assess the social significance of religious affiliation relative to other factors and its implications for integration and policy debates.	A document is relevant if it directly examines religious affiliation (Religionszugehörigkeit) as a measured category—such as reporting its distribution across regions or time (e.g., ALLBUS Christian/atheist shares, East–West differences) or analyzing its associations with outcomes like social capital, civic engagement, or divorce risk (e.g., lower risk among Catholics), or among refugees and youth. It is also relevant when it compares denominations (Protestant/Catholic/Muslim), uses ALLBUS/SOEP to model effects, or critically evaluates whether affiliation is an adequate proxy for religiosity, because these still center the concept and its measurement. Only marginally relevant are texts that mention the term in passing—listing it as a control in studies of family ties, including it in CV policy debates about removing private data, or legal pieces that say “regardless of religious affiliation” without analyzing affiliation. Not relevant are works about religion or secularization that never classify people by affiliation, or studies focused on other determinants (e.g., party identification, parenting roles) without claims about affiliation. Edge cases include attitude studies where results hinge on affiliation categories (e.g., homophobia linked to Islamic affiliation—relevant) and church-internal analyses of antisemitism that become relevant only if they test links between Christian affiliation and attitudes using population data.
62289	generation y	The user is seeking research on Generation Y (millennials)—who they are and how their attitudes and behaviors differ from other cohorts—particularly regarding family and gender role values, consumer/sports hero preferences, and adoption of digital health technologies.	A document is relevant if it explicitly focuses on Generation Y (also called Gen Y or Millennials), defines the cohort by birth years, and examines their attitudes, behaviors, or needs—such as comparisons with Generation X, marketing responses, or health technology usage. Examples of clearly relevant items include studies of Israeli Gen Y views on family and gender roles, research on Canadian Gen Y youth’s sport-hero preferences for endorsement strategy, and analyses of Gen Y preferences for transparency and efficiency in digital health tools. Content that only mentions an age band (e.g., 18–29 or “born after 1978”) can be conditionally relevant if it explicitly maps that band to the Generation Y cohort; otherwise, adolescent or youth studies without cohort framing are not. Non-relevant documents include those where “generation” and “y” co-occur incidentally (e.g., Spanish texts where “y” is the conjunction “and”) or materials about diasporas, labor markets, or politics that do not analyze the Gen Y cohort. Edge cases include region-specific cohort cutoffs that differ by country, mislabeling younger teens as Gen Y, and technical uses of “Y” (e.g., Y chromosome or engineering terms) that produce false positives.
62491	generation	The query seeks an overview of research on generations and intergenerational dynamics, focusing on cohort differences and trends in religion, trust, education and immigrant assimilation, political participation, national identity, and legal/ethical frameworks for intergenerational justice and future generations’ rights. It also notes methodological and data-generation approaches used to analyze these patterns.	A document is relevant if it uses “generation” to mean age cohorts or intergenerational relations (e.g., analyses of first/second immigrant generations, the 1968 generation, secularization across younger vs. older generations, or legal debates about the rights of future generations), or if it uses “generation” in the production sense (e.g., data generation mechanisms or generated populations for simulations). Items focused on “generalized trust,” “generalization,” or “generativity” are typically non-relevant despite lexical overlap, unless they also explicitly analyze generations as cohorts. Strong examples from the paragraph include studies of UK ethno-generational educational attainment, Mexican American vote choice by generation, national pride shifting by birth cohort, and intergenerational justice in climate law; the “state of the art of data generation mechanisms” is also relevant in the creation sense. Edge cases include plural and compound forms like “generations,” “intergenerational,” and “next-generation” (relevant), cross-language uses such as German “Generation” (relevant), and past-tense “generated” which is relevant only when tied to the act of producing something (e.g., datasets), not when embedded in unrelated words like “generalized.” Documents that merely mention generations in passing while centering other constructs (e.g., trust without a cohort focus) may be only weakly relevant.
6267	abtreibung	The user seeks an overview of abortion as a contested social issue, including its legal regulation, historical evolution, feminist and political debates, and public attitudes. The focus is on Germany (East/West differences and post-reunification changes) with comparative perspectives from other countries.	A document is relevant to the query “abtreibung” if it substantively addresses induced abortion (using terms like Abtreibung, Schwangerschaftsabbruch, Abtreibungsrecht), for example by analyzing legal frameworks (e.g., DDR vs. BRD and the 1995 law), sociological or feminist debates (such as Boltanski’s work), public opinion data (ALLBUS surveys), counseling practices, or cross-national developments (Poland, Argentina, Switzerland, USA, Russia, France). Materials that compare abortion to related issues like assisted reproduction or broader reproductive rights remain relevant when abortion is a central analytical thread, not just a passing mention. Synonyms, compounds, and variations (e.g., Abtreibungspolitik, Abtreibungsregulierung) count toward relevance; historical narratives and media discourse studies are also relevant if abortion is the focus. Non-relevant items include texts that only name “Abtreibung” in a list of topics without discussion, use the term metaphorically, or deal solely with miscarriage (Fehlgeburt) or generic gender policy without engaging abortion. As an edge case, documents centered on adjacent themes (e.g., school prayer or environmental ethics) are only weakly relevant unless they explicitly tie their arguments to abortion policy or activism.
6322	klima	The user seeks a comprehensive overview of climate and climate change, including anthropogenic drivers, historical variability, modeling and future scenarios, and sectoral impacts. They also want analysis of how food systems, energy and biofuels policy, and multi-level governance (EU, G7, UN COPs) shape climate action, with case studies (e.g., Poland, Ukraine) and related social, spatial-planning, and security dimensions.	A document is relevant to the query “klima” when it addresses climate in the environmental sense—e.g., anthropogenic greenhouse gases, climate change impacts and variability, climate models and scenarios, mitigation/adaptation, or climate policy and diplomacy such as COP24/COP29, EU 2040 targets, G7 “Klimaclub,” emissions reduction, and climate finance. Sectoral links like food systems and land use (diet-related emissions, agricultural vulnerability in Ukraine) or energy/industry topics framed as “Klima- und Energiepolitik” also count as relevant. By contrast, uses of “Klima” as a metaphor for social or political mood (e.g., attitudes toward gender roles, civility of debate, “politisches Klima” around parties) are non-relevant unless explicitly tied back to environmental climate governance. Edge cases include hyphenated compounds and derivatives (Klimawandel, Klimaschutz, Klimaanpassung), one-off mentions that don’t substantively discuss climate, or “Klima” referring to air conditioning/brands or a surname, which should be excluded. German-language content is expected, but English pieces about “climate” can be relevant if the retrieval is cross-lingual and the topical focus matches.
63419	islam	The user seeks an academic overview of contemporary Islam and Islamism, emphasizing the distinction between moderate and radical currents, their relationship to democracy and secularism, and economic dimensions such as Islamic banking. They want comparative case studies (e.g., Indonesia, Turkey, West Africa, Europe, Russia) showing how Islamic discourse shapes politics, society, and global diplomacy.	A document is relevant to the query “islam” when Islam—the religion, its communities, doctrines, movements, or institutions—is the central focus, indicated by substantive, frequent use of terms like Islam, Islamic, Muslim, Shari‘a, or Islamism. Analyses of political Islam/Islamism in Arab societies, Indonesia’s “moderate Islam” diplomacy and Islamic higher education, Islamic banking and finance in Germany or Tajikistan, or studies of Islam and democracy (such as national surveys in Indonesia) are highly relevant because they use Islam to explain politics, economics, or society. Works on Sufism or Islam in Africa, Islamic entrepreneurs in Turkey, or historical debates on secularism within Islamic thought remain relevant if Islam frames the argument, while pieces that only mention Muslims in passing or treat globalization with a brief nod to Islam are marginal. Items that match the string incidentally (e.g., place names like Islamabad, brand names, or “Islamic” used loosely without engaging Islamic beliefs, institutions, or communities) are non-relevant; likewise, generic banking or legal articles without a Shari‘a dimension should be down-ranked. Edge cases include critiques centered on “Islamism” (still relevant because they analyze movements rooted in Islamic discourse) and discussions of pre-Islamic contexts or “Islamicate secularities” that are relevant only when explicitly tied to how Islam is defined, practiced, or contested.
6370	klimawandel	The user seeks scholarly resources on climate change that analyze its political framing and governance, including mitigation and adaptation strategies—particularly in urban and regional planning. They also want insights into social impacts and vulnerabilities (gender, poverty, conflict, migration, human rights) with region-specific cases from Europe, Russia, Africa, and developing countries.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses climate change (Klimawandel) as a phenomenon or policy problem—its causes (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions), impacts (sea-level rise, extreme weather, water/food insecurity), or responses (mitigation, adaptation), including political discourse and governance. Examples include analyses of party platforms in Germany/Austria/Switzerland, urban and regional planning tools for climate adaptation, gendered effects of climate policy, links between climate and conflict or migration, human-rights and development implications, or region-specific discussions (e.g., Russia’s climate debate, Africa’s vulnerability). Works that define concepts (glossaries), frame Klimawandel theoretically (e.g., “super wicked problem”), or evaluate adaptation programs and funding are also relevant. Non-relevant are texts that use “Klima” in unrelated senses (business/organizational climate, air-conditioning), pieces that only name-drop Klimawandel without analysis, or content limited to short-term weather with no climate link. Edge cases include broader planning or security papers where climate change is just one driver; these are weakly or partially relevant unless the depth and proportion of discussion on adaptation/mitigation or climate impacts is substantial, and synonyms like “global warming” or “greenhouse effect” also count.
6481	home office	Seeks research and data on working from home (“home office”): access and usage patterns, contractual/recognition aspects, and impacts on stress, work–life balance, and productivity, especially during COVID-19. Also looks for differences across occupations and demographics and the importance of supportive home conditions.	A document is relevant if it discusses “home office” as working from home/telework, including access, usage, policies or contracts, time recognition, impacts on stress or work–life balance, and conditions that make home working effective or harmful. Examples of relevance include surveys on telework during COVID-19, analyses of who can use home office and how much, studies of “home office environment,” and accounts of freelancers performing editorial work from their home offices; synonyms like telework, remote work, WFH, and German-language “Homeoffice” also count. Non-relevant items use “Home Office” to mean the UK government department, refer to “office” or “home” in unrelated contexts (statistical offices, branch offices, private offices/cabinets, officer corps), or describe work done in clients’ homes (e.g., psychiatric teams’ field visits) or home gardening. Edge cases include “home office” as a corporate headquarters or central admin (“return to the home office”), missionary “home office management,” or interior design of a home-office room—these are only relevant if they concern employment practices of working from one’s residence. Capitalization differences and multilingual usage should be considered, but the core criterion is a focus on employment performed from home rather than government agencies, physical offices, or unrelated “home” activities.
6499	politische bildung	The user seeks a comprehensive understanding of political education (politische Bildung), including competing definitions of “politics,” democratic and critical foundations, aims and methods, and implementation across schools and adult education in German-speaking contexts. They want scholarly overviews, frameworks, empirical findings, and insight into current trends, rankings, and controversies (e.g., extremism prevention, professionalism, and the relation to democracy education).	A document is relevant if it explicitly treats politische Bildung as its subject—defining its aims and core concepts (e.g., the “Politikbegriff”), debating its relationship to Demokratiepädagogik, outlining didactics and methods, or analyzing its institutional settings in schools, vocational education, and adult or out-of-school youth education in German-speaking contexts. Clear examples include studies that compare curriculum time for political education (Sekundarstufe I rankings), analyses of political education in vocational schools, empirical mappings of adult political education, or theory-led pieces applying Bourdieu or Laclau/Mouffe to political learning, participation, and Mündigkeit. Adjacent topics are also relevant when explicitly situated within political education, such as extremism prevention in curricula, the aesthetics of political mediation in classrooms, professionalization/teacher training, or critiques of neoliberal competence frameworks that shape political education practice. Non-relevant are documents that discuss politics or sociology in general without linking to political education, education policy pieces not about the political/civic domain, or texts that only mention the term in passing; likewise, work solely on democracy education is borderline unless it connects or contrasts with politische Bildung. Edge cases: cross-national or historical-institutional treatments (e.g., journals, associations) are relevant if they center on political education, and English synonyms like civic or citizenship education typically qualify when the focus matches the field of politische Bildung.
6501	homosexualität	The user is seeking comprehensive scholarly information on homosexuality, spanning historical and psychoanalytic theories, legal and policy regimes, education and religion, media/sports discourse, and the lived experiences of gay and lesbian people. The goal is to understand how homosexuality has been conceptualized, regulated, and stigmatized across time and institutions, particularly in German/European contexts.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses homosexuality (Homosexualität) as identity, practice, social/medical concept, policy target, or cultural discourse—e.g., psychoanalytic treatments of homosexual patients, school and religious-pedagogy approaches, National Socialist constructions and persecution, football “outing” debates, Russia’s 2013 “propaganda” law and hate-crime trends, or studies of Berlin youths’ attitudes. Comparative works that analyze homosexuality alongside intersexuality, transsexuality, or heterosexuality are relevant when they devote meaningful sections to homosexuality or use it centrally to argue about gender/sexual science; historical or synonymous terms such as Homophilie, Sodomie, gleichgeschlechtliche Liebe, schwul, and LSBTI also signal relevance. Empirical studies (surveys, interviews, statistics) and theoretical critiques (e.g., Foucaultian analyses, social-construction debates) qualify as long as homosexuality is a primary object, not a passing example. Non-relevant items include texts that only mention the term in passing, works focused solely on other gender/sexuality categories without substantive discussion of homosexuality, or duplicate summaries that add no new content. Edge cases include male-centric historical overviews (still relevant but narrow in scope) or analyses within period-specific frames (e.g., Roman active/passive norms, Nazi “deficit” narratives), which remain relevant if they critically engage homosexuality in those contexts.
6534	kriminalitätsfurcht	The user seeks scholarly research on fear of crime, including its dimensions (cognitive/affective/behavioral), gender differences and determinants (resources, norms, neighborhood, lifestyle, media/policing), the mismatch with objective crime trends, and methodological critiques of standard measures, with evidence from German and comparative surveys (e.g., ALLBUS, GSS, victimization surveys).	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses Kriminalitätsfurcht (fear of crime) as a concept, its dimensions (e.g., cognitive risk appraisal, affective fear, and conative avoidance), its predictors (gender differences, incivilities, neighborhood composition, police presence, media exposure), or its trends across time or countries using surveys like ALLBUS, GSS, SOEP, or local victimization studies. Analyses that critique measurement—such as the validity of “feeling unsafe alone at night” as a standard indicator, factor-analytic tests, or nonresponse bias in victimization surveys—are also highly relevant, as are models framing fear as a stress process or linking it to punitivity. Examples include studies showing women’s persistently higher fear, the decoupling of objective crime rates from fear, or the impact of egalitarian gender norms on fear without eliminating the gender gap. Non-relevant are pieces that only report crime rates, policing data, or general urban disorder without connecting them to perceived fear, or texts about “fear” unrelated to crime. Edge cases include discussions of “broken windows” or media effects that mention fear indirectly (relevant if they measure or theorize fear), or purely political commentaries on urban governance that invoke fear rhetorically without empirical or conceptual treatment (usually not relevant).
65758	hochschule	The user seeks analyses and best practices about higher education institutions (Hochschulen), especially in German-speaking contexts. Key interests include anti-discrimination and equality policies, accreditation and quality assurance, student selection and rankings, sustainability and regional engagement, innovation support, and inclusion measures for groups such as women, refugees, and students with children.	A document is relevant to the query “hochschule” when it substantively addresses higher-education institutions (Universitäten, Hochschulen, Fachhochschulen) and their policies, practices, or roles, such as anti-discrimination frameworks on campus, student selection and rankings, sustainable regional engagement, continuing education, accreditation/quality management, or academic employment conditions. Analyses, case studies, or guidance aimed at university governance and services—e.g., discussions of complaint offices under the AGG, examples from Universität Augsburg or Hochschule Darmstadt, or initiatives for student parents or refugee integration—clearly match the query. By contrast, texts that only mention the word in passing, use it as part of a name (publisher, street, or organization), or discuss education without a higher-education context are non-relevant. Edge cases include pieces centered on women’s equality or innovation that are explicitly situated in universities (relevant) versus general labor-market or K–12 topics that merely drop the term once (non-relevant), and documents using synonyms like Universität or plural forms (Hochschulen), which should still be treated as relevant.
6616	politische partizipation	The user seeks a comprehensive overview of political participation—its definitions, functions, forms (conventional, unconventional, online), measurement, and theoretical foundations—along with empirical evidence from Germany. They want determinants and disparities across groups (education, gender, age, religiosity, social capital, media use, migration, disability), East–West differences, and trends over time, often using ALLBUS data.	A document is relevant if it defines, theorizes, measures, or empirically analyzes political participation as citizen involvement in democratic will-formation and decision-making, covering forms such as voting, contacting officials, working in organizations, petitions, demonstrations, boycotts, or online participation. Especially relevant are studies of determinants and contexts—e.g., religiosity (practice vs denomination), political knowledge types, social capital and networks, media use (TV vs internet), institutional multilevel settings, and group differences by region (East/West Germany), gender, age, education, migration background, disability, or youth—ideally using survey data like ALLBUS (1992, 1998, 2008, 2018). Methodological contributions that operationalize participation (intentions vs manifested behavior), compare cross-sectional and panel models, or map dimensions and typologies of participants also qualify. Non-relevant are texts that use “Partizipation” in non-political domains (e.g., classroom or social work participation) or describe general volunteering without linking it to political influence on policy or representation. Edge cases: normative essays count if they situate participation within democratic theory or functions (intermediation, socialization, legitimacy), and digital participation pieces are pertinent when they distinguish meaningful engagement from “pseudo-participation” and tie it to political outcomes.
66195	environmental	The user seeks research-based insights into what drives environmental concern and pro-environmental behavior, including the roles of age, demographics, social networks, information sources, and national governance. They want cross-national evidence on how these factors shape private and public actions, activism, policy support, and environmental justice.	A document is relevant if it substantively examines environmental topics—such as ecology, sustainability, climate change, pollution, conservation—or the social, behavioral, and policy dimensions of these issues. Examples include studies of environmental concern and pro-environmental behavior, analyses of environmental governance and collective action, discussions of environmental justice or refugees, assessments of environmental monitoring, and work on green purchasing or information sources that shape environmental actions. A document is non-relevant if “environmental” appears only in passing or in a different sense, e.g., business “environmental scanning” (market context), software “environment variables,” or generic mentions of an experimental environment without ecological implications. Edge cases like trade-and-environment, environmental security, or demographic moderators (age, wealth, education) are relevant when they explicitly link to environmental impacts, policies, or behaviors. Conversely, pieces where “environmental” is present only in an organization’s name or as a historical aside without substantive environmental analysis would not meet the query’s intent.
6719	welfare	The user seeks cross-national research on welfare states and public attitudes toward welfare. Specifically, they want to understand how macroeconomic conditions, individual characteristics (e.g., religion, age, class), cultural/regime contexts, taxation, migration, and globalization shape support for government responsibility, deservingness views, and policy/political outcomes.	A document is relevant if it examines social welfare as public assistance or the welfare state—such as attitudes toward government responsibility, welfare regime models, funding and taxation, fraud and deservingness, or how macroeconomic conditions, religion, migration, or FDI shape welfare policy and opinions. Empirical studies using surveys like WVS/EVS/ISSP, cross-national comparisons of liberal vs social-democratic regimes, and country cases (e.g., Sweden, Netherlands, Australia, China, Korea) are strong matches because they directly analyze welfare systems and politics. Theory pieces that define or critique welfare regimes (e.g., Esping-Andersen frameworks, Confucian welfare cluster) or debate reform concepts like activation, rights/responsibilities, and workfare also count as relevant. Documents become less relevant when “welfare” means generic well-being, employee benefits, or animal welfare, or when it’s a passing mention not tied to social policy, redistribution, or public programs; welfare economics focused only on abstract social welfare functions without policy implications is borderline. Edge cases include religious or civil-society “welfare” provision and welfare crime/fraud—these remain relevant if they concern the administration, legitimacy, or outcomes of the welfare state.
67543	flüchtling	The user seeks scholarly and policy-oriented information on refugees, including how the category is defined and discursively constructed. They want evidence and case studies on public attitudes, legal and institutional frameworks, integration and housing in Germany, education and labor market participation, and comparative experiences in other countries.	A document is relevant if it substantively discusses refugees (Flüchtling) in German, including definitions, legal status, lived experiences, public attitudes, or policies, and uses the term itself or its morphological/compound forms (e.g., Flüchtlinge, Flüchtlingspolitik, Flüchtlingsunterkünfte). Strong examples include theoretical debates about who counts as a Flüchtling versus migrant or Asylbewerber, empirical studies on housing, integration, education or labor market outcomes, surveys like ALLBUS on attitudes, or case studies such as Eritrean refugees in Tel Aviv or Syrian refugees in Jordan, as well as historical discussions of “echte Flüchtlinge.” Documents that address migration generally without linking to refugees, focus exclusively on other categories (e.g., only Binnenvertriebene or labor migrants), or only mention the word in passing without analysis, are less relevant. Edge cases: texts analyzing the discursive construction of “Flüchtling,” or using compounds and inflected forms, are relevant; pieces focused solely on “Flucht” (flight) without designating persons as Flüchtlinge, or metaphorical/proper-name uses of “Flüchtling,” should be treated as peripheral. Spelling variants (Fluechtling, missing umlaut), capitalization differences, and historical/regional subsets (DDR-Flüchtlinge, palästinensische Flüchtlinge) remain relevant when the subject is refugees.
6763	psychotherapie	The user seeks research-based information on psychotherapy, including its approaches, effectiveness in real-world practice, and how it is applied. They want evidence on innovations (nature-integrated and digital/self-guided therapies), factors that influence outcomes and therapist/patient preferences, and broader social contexts shaping psychotherapy.	A document is relevant if it primarily addresses psychotherapy—its practices, modalities, outcomes, settings, or professionals—such as surveys of nature-integrating psychotherapy, studies linking psychotherapy to institutional trust after GDR repression, or trials of self-guided internet-based therapy for depression. Empirical work (RCTs, naturalistic effectiveness studies, qualitative case studies), theoretical frameworks, book reviews, and critiques that analyze psychotherapy as a discipline (e.g., positive psychotherapy, digital transformation of care, therapist preference predictors) are also relevant. Documents focusing on adjacent domains like counseling or coaching can be relevant when explicitly situated within psychotherapeutic theory or clinical practice, but pieces where “psychotherapy” is only a passing mention, a journal header without substantive psychotherapeutic content, or discussions of non-mental-health “therapy” would be non-relevant. Edge cases include studies where psychotherapy is a predictor rather than the main topic (still relevant if it analyzes psychotherapy use or effects) and multilingual variants: German “Psychotherapie,” “psychotherapeutisch,” and English “psychotherapy/psychotherapist” all count. Content on specific populations (infants/toddlers in parent–child therapy, adolescents, outpatient practice) and diverse orientations (psychodynamic, humanistic, systemic, behavioral) strengthens relevance.
67689	family	Find scholarly research on family dynamics, strengths, functioning, and policy—including work–family conflict, socioeconomic and cultural influences, and pandemic effects—and how these factors relate to well-being, child outcomes, and fertility across countries.	A document is relevant if “family” is its core subject—e.g., it analyzes family relationships, functioning, or well-being, treats the family as a unit of analysis, or evaluates family-focused policy. Studies measuring family constructs such as commitment, communication, cohesion, coping, and competence, or topics like family climate during COVID-19, fathers’ work–family conflict, or meta-analyses linking family strengths to personal and family outcomes are clearly relevant. Policy and cross-cultural work that examines family roles, intergenerational care, fertility, or the institutional status of families (for example, Slovak family policy, Mediterranean caregiving, or trends in Swedish family change) are also relevant. Edge cases include medical or genetic studies of “familial” conditions or “family aggregation”: they are relevant only when they address family dynamics, caregiving, or household impacts, but not when they focus solely on biological inheritance; likewise, workplace research is relevant if it links to family outcomes but not if “family” is merely mentioned. Non-relevant items use “family” in a different sense (taxonomic family, “family of models/products”) or only in a title, venue, or affiliation without substantive analysis of families.
6854	natur	The user is seeking scholarly analyses of “nature” as a concept, especially debates on the nature–culture/society distinction, “second nature,” and how modern science and technology blur these boundaries. They want theoretical and empirical perspectives including environmental ethics and rights of nature, feminist care critiques, ANT, and studies of nature perception.	A document is relevant if it substantively discusses “Natur” (nature) as a concept or domain—e.g., treatments of zweite Natur/second nature, the nature–culture (Natur–Kultur) distinction, environmental ethics (Naturethik), perceptions of nature (Naturwahrnehmung), or legal/moral debates such as rights of nature—especially when “Natur” appears in German compounds like Naturwissenschaft(en), Naturverhältnisse, or Naturverständnis. It also counts when “Natur” is central to sociological, philosophical, feminist, or ecological analyses, such as studies of park landscapes, Gaia, or societal constructions of nature, rather than being a passing mention. Borderline cases include technical compounds where “Natur” is present but the focus is not nature itself (e.g., a brief nod to Naturwissenschaften in a purely methodological piece). Non-relevant hits are those where “natur” occurs only as a substring or filler (natürlich = “of course”), in unrelated English phrases like natural numbers or natural language, or in proper names/brands/journals (“Nature”) without thematic engagement with nature. Spelling variants and plurals (Naturen, naturnah, Naturbegriff) should be treated as relevant when they point to substantive discussion, not mere incidental usage.
718	turkey	Seeks a comprehensive overview of Turkey’s relationship with the EU and its evolving geopolitical role. Focus areas include migration dynamics and the refugee crisis, energy security strategy, democratization and minority rights, European public attitudes, and the implications for EU accession and cooperation.	A document is relevant to the query “turkey” when it clearly concerns the country—its migration patterns with the EU, accession politics, energy geopolitics, foreign policy, human rights, or domestic policy—using terms like EU-Turkey relations, Turkish migration, Ankara, or pipelines through the Bosporus. The provided paragraph is strongly relevant because it analyzes EU–Turkey migration (emigration/immigration, readmission), public attitudes toward Turkey’s EU bid, humanitarian policy for Syrian refugees, energy hub dynamics (BTC/BTE), climate strategy, minority rights under the Copenhagen criteria, and broader foreign and security ties. Documents about “turkey” as poultry (recipes, hunting, Thanksgiving), the slang sense of “a turkey” meaning a failure, or pieces that only name Turkey in passing without substantive discussion are non-relevant. Edge cases include comparative EU studies that mention Turkey briefly, items using “Türkiye,” “Turkish,” or “Anatolia” instead of “Turkey,” and datasets listing Turkey among many countries; these are relevant only if they provide meaningful, specific information about the state rather than incidental mentions.
729	trust	The user seeks a scholarly overview of trust that clarifies definitions and types (particularized vs generalized, social vs institutional), how trust is measured, formed, and transmitted, and how cultural and contextual factors moderate it. They also want evidence on trust’s consequences for cooperation and policy-relevant attitudes (e.g., toward government, media, regulation, tax morale) and whether trust is declining over time.	A document is relevant if it centers on trust as a social, political, organizational, or psychological construct—defining it, theorizing its processes, or measuring it (for example, studies on generalized vs. particularized trust, intergenerational transmission among immigrants, or how cultural factors like long-term orientation shape trust). Empirical works that model institutional or domain-specific trust—trust in media, government, EU institutions, regulatory agencies, or management during organizational change—and papers linking trust to outcomes such as cooperation, tax morale, technology acceptance (e.g., GM food), or responses during crises (e.g., COVID fears) are also highly relevant. Methodological contributions that review or improve trust measurement (e.g., WVS/EVS comparisons, HGLM/HLM analyses, survey scale audits) qualify as relevant. By contrast, documents where “trust” is incidental or used in a different sense (legal/financial trusts, antitrust law, zero-trust cybersecurity, or casual mentions where trust is a minor control variable) are non-relevant. Edge cases include work on distrust/mistrust, social capital or confidence as proxies, and philosophical treatments of trust in conflict—all relevant—whereas items like “trust region” optimization or proper nouns/brands containing “Trust” are not.
7422	psychische	Find research and discussion on mental health burdens (psychische Belastungen): their prevalence, causes, and consequences across populations (parents of young children, students, workers, unemployed, refugees), particularly in Germany and amid recent crises like COVID-19 and the Ukraine war. Also sought are sociological perspectives and evidence on interventions, treatment, and support services.	A document is relevant if it meaningfully uses the German adjective “psychische” in its content (title, abstract, or body), especially in phrases like “psychische Belastung,” “psychische Gesundheit,” or “psychische Störungen,” such as studies on parents’ mental strain, COVID-19 impacts, unemployment and mental health, or services for children of mentally ill parents. Items that discuss “psychische Systeme” in systems theory also match the keyword and are relevant for pure term retrieval, though they may be topically less aligned if the user intent is clinical mental health. A document is non-relevant if “psychische” appears only incidentally (e.g., in citations, lists of keywords, or tangential remarks) or if the topic is unrelated and the term is not integral to the main content. Edge cases include capitalization (“Psychische”), inflected forms (“psychischen,” “psychischer”), and hyphenation, which strict exact-match engines might miss but stemmed or lemmatized searches would capture. Likewise, texts using only English equivalents (“mental,” “psychological”) or abbreviations (“psych.”) won’t match unless the system applies synonym or cross-lingual expansion.
7445	psychische erkrankungen	The user seeks a comprehensive overview of mental illnesses, including their classification, prevalence, and socioeconomic/legal impacts such as work disability and pensions. They also want evidence-based prevention and rehabilitation strategies, workplace reintegration approaches, supports for affected families and children, and insights on stigma and media influences.	A document is relevant if it substantively discusses mental illnesses (psychische Erkrankungen) as conditions—covering definitions/classification, prevalence and costs, treatment or prevention, rehabilitation, work reintegration, social policy/legal aspects, or societal representations and stigma. Examples include policy reports on prevention and disability pensions, studies on children of mentally ill parents or return-to-work after depression, analyses of “depression memes” and their implications, surveys of comorbidity, or historical/organizational perspectives on psychiatric care. Content focused on specific disorders (e.g., anxiety, schizophrenia, depression), on interventions (therapy, medication, coaching), or on risk frameworks in mental health practice is also relevant. Documents are non-relevant when they only mention the term in passing, discuss general stress/well-being without linking to diagnosable disorders, or address unrelated health or administrative topics. Edge cases include pieces about “psychiatric” vs. “psychological” disorders (both acceptable), methodological texts that use “psychische Belastung” without engaging illness concepts (likely marginal), and media/cultural analyses that qualify if they connect portrayal to mental illness understanding or outcomes.
7488	psychische belastung	The user is seeking an overview of psychische Belastung (psychological strain), including its definition, prevalence and recent trends, risk factors, and impacts on health, work, and child development across various groups. They also want evidence-based assessment tools and interventions to reduce burden and promote wellbeing, particularly in the German context.	A document is relevant to the query “psychische belastung” when psychological burden/strain is a central topic—defined, measured, or analyzed in depth—such as studies reporting prevalence and consequences among parents of infants, employees, prisoners (JD-R model), caregivers, migrants, or youth, or reports offering interventions and instruments (e.g., COPSOQ) to assess or reduce it. Highly relevant examples include analyses linking parental psychological burden to child developmental outcomes, Fehlzeiten reports on workplace mental strain and prevention, or meta-analyses of caregiver burden with predictors and intervention effects. Methodological or theoretical pieces that operationalize the construct (e.g., differentiating psychische Belastung from demands, or mediators like emotional competencies) are also relevant if they explicitly address measurement or mechanisms of psychological strain. A document is non-relevant if “psychische Belastung” is mentioned only in passing (e.g., as one item in a list of societal problems), if the focus is solely on physical workload, general economic policy, or psychiatric treatment without framing experiences as psychological burden. Edge cases include texts using close variants or synonyms (“psychisch belastet,” “psychische Belastungen,” “mental strain”), interdisciplinary volumes where burden is treated as a cross-cutting theme, or tools like emotion diaries—these are relevant when they directly engage with how psychological burden is assessed, mediated, or accommodated; they are not relevant when “Belastung” is merely metaphorical or unrelated to mental strain.
79	environment	The user seeks interdisciplinary research on how different environments—built/urban, virtual, home/school learning, and organizational/institutional—shape human outcomes. They want evidence, frameworks, and measurement tools linking environmental contexts to health, cognition, safety, behavior, performance, and policy.	A document is relevant to the query “environment” when it treats an environment as the central object of analysis or intervention and examines how its features affect outcomes, whether that environment is natural, built/urban, institutional, learning, or workplace. For example, studies of the built environment’s association with obesity, urban environment quality and perceived safety, or the separate effects of home and institutional learning environments on children’s vocabulary are squarely relevant. Work on environmental policy and attitudes (e.g., ISSP Environment), virtual nature environments’ psychological effects, or trade agreements’ environment provisions also fit because “environment” is integral to the research question. By contrast, papers that mention “environment” only as a generic backdrop (such as “digital business environment” in a strategy overview) or as a passing label (e.g., retail “shopping environment” aesthetics) are less relevant unless the environment’s attributes are measured and causally linked to outcomes. Edge cases include uses in computing (software/runtime environments) or organizational culture; judge relevance by prominence (title/abstract), term frequency, presence of related concepts (ecology, urban design, sustainability), and whether the environment is operationalized with specific indicators.
7939	psychologie	The user is seeking an overview of debates on psychology’s identity, methods, and social role as a science and profession. They want perspectives contrasting mainstream and critical/non-mainstream approaches (e.g., clinical dominance, data sharing and publishing, nomological vs hermeneutic methods, indigenous/feminist/antiracist and cross-cultural currents) and their implications for teaching and practice.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses psychology as a discipline—its theories, methods, practices, or debates—such as interviews with psychologists, critiques of mainstream versus critical psychology, discussions of data sharing and infrastructures like PsychData, pedagogy, or the role of clinical psychology. Comparative, historical, or cultural perspectives (e.g., indigenous psychologies in China or Brazil, psychology under fascism, feminist/antiracist or postmodern approaches) are also relevant because they analyze psychology’s scope and impact. Non-relevant items are those that only mention “Psychologie” in passing (course listings, citation metadata, brand names) or focus primarily on adjacent fields (psychiatry, general philosophy) without linking back to psychological science. Edge cases include interdisciplinary work in neuroscience, linguistics, or anthropology: it is relevant if it explicitly frames implications for psychological theory or practice, but not if psychology is merely background. German-language usage and capitalization (Psychologie) match the query and are relevant; unrelated uses of similar terms or translations should be excluded.
81	climate change	The user seeks an overview of social science research on climate change, focusing on public trust and literacy, media discourse, and cultural/economic and place-based factors, and how these shape mitigation/adaptation behaviors, migration intentions, and policy support across countries. They also want perspectives on justice and security implications and the evolution of national climate policies.	A document is relevant to the query “climate change” when it substantively addresses climate change/global warming—its causes, impacts, mitigation or adaptation, public opinion, or governance (e.g., IPCC assessments, decarbonization, net-zero). Analyses of trust in climate science, surveys of climate-friendly behaviors in the EU, how climate literacy conditions migration intentions in Africa, or framing climate impacts as security or human-rights issues are relevant because they explicitly link social or policy outcomes to climate change. Content on media communication of climate issues, country policy evolution (such as China’s or Japan’s climate policy), risk perception determinants, or education programs that aim to increase climate knowledge and action also qualify. Non-relevant items include pieces that use “climate” metaphorically (business/organizational climate), discuss weather events or disasters without attributing them to climate change, focus on COVID-19 or general politics without an explicit climate connection, or mention climate change only in passing. Edge cases: studies of recycling or energy choices are relevant if framed as climate mitigation; disaster case studies (e.g., typhoons) are relevant only when tied to climate change; and synonyms like global warming, climate crisis, decarbonization, or net-zero should be treated as in scope.
810	bildungsgrad	The user seeks an overview of educational attainment (Bildungsgrad) in the EU/Germany, including how it is defined/measured and recent trends by age and gender. They also want evidence on how education level correlates with employment, internet use, service utilization, civic/political attitudes, and health behaviors.	A document is relevant if it explicitly discusses educational attainment (Bildungsgrad) or closely related terms, especially when measuring or comparing education levels across groups, regions, or time, or linking them to outcomes. Examples include analyses of secondary/tertiary completion rates, gender differences in university degrees, employment or internet use by education level, health behavior stratified by education, or survey-based results (e.g., ALLBUS, Mikrozensus) that report indicators by educational level. Texts using synonyms like Bildungsstand/Bildungsniveau, formal credentials (Hochschulabschluss, Sekundarstufe II, tertiär), or phrases such as niedrig/hoch gebildet are also relevant. Documents are non-relevant if they mention the word only in passing (e.g., in a list, footnote, or author bio), discuss “education” generally without referring to levels/attainment, or use “Grad” for non-educational meanings. Edge cases include OCR or inflected variants (Bildungsgrades, Bildungsgrads), hyphenations (Bildungs-grad), or proxies like “Volksschülerinnen ohne Lehre”; these should count if they clearly denote education level, while unrelated compounds should not.
8246	politisches engagement	The user seeks scholarly information on political/civic engagement, its forms, and the mechanisms that promote or hinder it—particularly the roles of associations/skills, education, income, migration, gender, and dissatisfaction. They also want evidence on trends in Germany (especially post-reunification), youth patterns, and how state policies and programs foster engagement.	A document is relevant if it directly examines political engagement—such as voting, party membership, conventional participation, legal/illegal protest, activism—or the mechanisms, predictors, and effects behind it. Clear matches include empirical studies of Vereinsmitgliedschaft and skills acquisition as drivers of participation, ALLBUS-based analyses linking education and income to engagement, youth and migration studies that trace inequalities in political participation, or discussions framed in the input/output logic of the political system and post‑DDR protest dynamics. Civic or voluntary engagement texts are relevant when they explicitly connect to political participation or state “Engagementpolitik” (for example, how organizations, resources, or program designs affect political involvement). Non‑relevant items include pieces on volunteering as a tool for labor‑market reintegration without a political dimension, administrative program evaluations that don’t address participation, generic overviews of “bürgerschaftliches Engagement” with no political link, or uses of “Engagement” meaning employee, personal, or romantic commitment. Edge cases include union activism that straddles workplace and political arenas, development-policy engagement where only some activities are political, and studies on political interest—relevant when treated as a precursor to participation but not when disconnected from engagement behaviors.
828	nachhaltigkeit	The user seeks an interdisciplinary overview of sustainability in the German context—how it is defined, balanced across ecological, social, and economic dimensions, and grounded in intergenerational justice. They want insights into implementation and communication (policy, work, media, education), public perceptions, and evaluations of progress and social impacts.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses Nachhaltigkeit/sustainable development as a concept, framework, or practice—e.g., defining its pillars (ecological, economic, social), linking it to intergenerational justice, or detailing how it is operationalized through participatory decision-making, metrics, and evaluations. Examples of clearly relevant content include analyses of Germany’s performance on emissions and inequality, sectoral applications (transport policy, forestry and “forest bathing,” higher education access, development cooperation), and empirical studies or surveys on how people understand and act on sustainability. Meta-level treatments—such as discourse and risk-communication analyses, sociological debates (“second wave” of sustainability sociology), or methodological guides for detecting and resolving sustainability dilemmas—are also relevant. A document is non-relevant if it only name-drops the term, uses “nachhaltig” merely to mean “lasting” (e.g., “sustainable effects” in a generic program evaluation) without engaging sustainability as a normative or multi-dimensional concept, or employs the term as branding without substance. Edge cases: theoretical critiques (ideology vs. utopia) remain relevant; pieces focused solely on fiscal or “structural sustainability” are only partially relevant unless they connect to broader ecological/social aims; duplicates or near-duplicates contribute little additional value.
8382	politische werte	The user is seeking scholarly information on political values—how they are defined, measured, and structured, and how they relate to religion, demographics, ideology, and political participation. They also want evidence on value change and its effects across contexts (especially Germany but including comparative cases), plus methodological considerations (e.g., missing data) and the role of media/public discourse.	A document is relevant if it directly analyzes political values or value orientations—defining dimensions like participation, egalitarianism, postmaterialism, or security/universalism; examining their correlates (e.g., with religion, age, education); or linking them to political behavior and attitudes (such as studies using ALLBUS, Eurobarometer, or GLES, SEM/LISREL to show value–voting links like nonconformist values and AfD support). Theoretical and comparative treatments that frame conflicts in terms of values—liberalism vs communitarianism, “Asian values,” headscarf regulations, or value change in transitions—are also relevant because they explicate which political values are promoted, contested, or evolving. Partially relevant are items that use “value” to mean utility in a political setting (e.g., the value of TV debates or the “publizistischer Wert” of media audiences), which match the term but do not analyze political value orientations. Non-relevant are methodological texts where “Werte” denotes data values (e.g., missing values in roll-call analyses) or uses of “value” unrelated to normative or attitudinal politics. Edge cases include general moral-philosophical discussions or subgroup studies (students, Russian elites); they are relevant when they explicitly connect values to political orientations or behavior, but not when they focus on measurement artifacts or generic worth.
8951	politische einstellungen	The user seeks an overview of political attitudes, especially in Germany, including how they are defined, measured, and have changed over time. They are interested in East–West differences, youth and migrant attitudes, determinants (e.g., education, authoritarianism), and links to democracy, institutions, and participation, often using surveys like ALLBUS.	A document is relevant if it directly examines, measures, or compares political attitudes of individuals or groups, such as East–West differences in Germany using ALLBUS data, youth views on democracy and trust in institutions, left–right positioning, or attitudes toward minorities and gender equality. Studies that analyze determinants or consequences of political attitudes (e.g., links between authoritarianism and ethnocentrism, effects of political knowledge, migration generation differences, or journalists’ ideological leanings) also qualify, as do DDR-era investigations that explicitly assess ideological attitudes. Comparative political-culture work on other countries or elites can still be relevant when it defines and evaluates attitudes toward political processes and institutions rather than merely describing systems. By contrast, pieces that focus on policy areas (e.g., family policy) or political communication without reporting attitudinal measures, or that only mention “politische Einstellungen” in passing, are non-relevant. Edge cases include handbooks or meta-reviews, which are relevant when they synthesize findings on political attitudes, but not when they are purely methodological or organizational without attitudinal results.
9035	politics	The user seeks research on how political knowledge/sophistication, media consumption, interest, and trust influence political participation through mechanisms like internal political efficacy and civic duty. They want comparative, empirical evidence on how these relationships vary by type of participation (voting, conventional, unconventional) and across groups and contexts (youth, education/class, gender, local vs. national, regions).	A document is relevant to the query “politics” when it substantively addresses political processes, institutions, or behavior—such as studies of political participation (voting, conventional and unconventional action), political knowledge and efficacy, media effects on attitudes, party competition, governance, or political symbolism. Empirical and theoretical works like twin designs testing whether attitudes cause participation, analyses of youth engagement across Europe, the role of political consumerism, or local democracy datasets clearly qualify, as do comparative and formal-model pieces on political trust and participation. Normative or conceptual treatments that define politics, political values, realism vs. idealism, and the culture–politics link are also relevant if they engage with power, authority, or civic action. Edge cases that still count include foreign-language abstracts about political engagement, political geography linking spatial context to behavior, and methodological papers when applied to political outcomes; however, mere incidental mentions of “politics,” workplace “office politics,” or purely methodological/statistical discussions without political application are non-relevant. Documents focused on non-governmental topics (marketing, general sociology, or culture) are non-relevant unless they explicitly tie back to political institutions, actors, or citizen behavior.
9089	political trust	Find scholarly research on political trust—how it is conceptualized and measured, how it varies across countries and over time, and what drives it (e.g., government performance, corruption, inequality perceptions, justice, social capital, issue salience). Also examine how political trust affects participation, media trust, and conspiracy beliefs, and how these relationships differ by context and period.	A document is relevant if it explicitly examines trust in political institutions (e.g., government, parliament, courts, police) by defining, measuring, or modeling “political trust,” its trends, determinants, or consequences. Strong signals include use of cross-national surveys (WVS/EVS/ESS/Eurobarometer), analyses of performance, corruption, inequality, social capital, or links to behaviors like voting, protest, or direct action, as well as studies tying media trust to political trust (the “trust nexus”). Methodological work that interrogates how political trust is measured or compared across countries (e.g., unidimensionality, Rasch modeling, equivalence) is also relevant because it shapes interpretation of findings. Non-relevant items discuss “trust” only in non-political domains (interpersonal or brand trust) or mention political topics without analyzing trust, or cover media trust without connecting it to trust in political institutions. Edge cases are relevant when they clearly center institutional trust—such as emigrants’ trust in homeland institutions, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs explained by political trust, or effects of direct democracy on trust—while standalone media-trust pieces or generic participation studies without a trust component are only partially relevant.
9169	political interest	The query seeks research on the determinants, development, and group differences in political interest—especially among immigrants and youth in Germany/Europe—including how integration, discrimination, national identification, education, class, gender, and mental health shape interest (including transnational interest) and, in turn, political participation. It also looks for evidence on macro-level variation in political interest over time and contexts.	A document is relevant if it directly examines “political interest” as an attitudinal construct—how much people are interested in politics—by defining or measuring it (e.g., survey items on interest in politics, macrointerest indices), analyzing its determinants (education, integration, discrimination, gender, class), or linking it to behaviors like voting and party activity. Studies that explicitly model political interest in specific populations (e.g., immigrants in Germany, adolescents in CILS4EU, gender differences, transnational interest in German vs. Turkish politics) or compare contexts over time or across countries are clearly relevant. Papers that focus primarily on adjacent constructs (political efficacy, participation) are relevant only if they include political interest as a distinct variable or outcome; if efficacy or participation is discussed without measuring interest, they are marginal. Non-relevant items use “interest” in other senses—public interests in global governance, business interests, interest groups, or economic interest rates—even if they are about politics. Edge cases include brief mentions of “interest in politics” without operationalization (weakly relevant) and studies of “apathy” or “political discussions” that serve as proxies for interest (potentially relevant if tied to an interest measure).
9243	political efficacy	The user seeks research-based information on political efficacy—definitions of internal vs. external efficacy, how it is measured, and its role as a mediator/predictor of political participation. They likely want empirical findings on determinants (e.g., political knowledge, media use, deliberation, gender, institutions) and cross-national patterns.	A document is relevant if it directly engages with political efficacy—especially internal (citizens’ perceived competence to influence politics) and external (perceived government responsiveness)—by defining it, measuring it, or testing its antecedents and consequences. Highly relevant examples include studies showing that political knowledge or media use increases internal efficacy and thereby participation, validations of efficacy scales (e.g., PESS or PPSE), cross-national trends or gaps (gender, education, income) in ISSP/EVS/CSES data, or institutional analyses linking direct democracy or government alternation to external efficacy. Methods-focused papers remain relevant when they model efficacy as a mediator or moderator of participation (e.g., mediated regressions, SEM, twin designs) or assess measurement invariance across countries. Non-relevant items include uses of “efficacy” in non-political domains (medical or instructional efficacy), discussions of participation or democracy that never theorize or measure efficacy, or pieces about “political efficiency” or government effectiveness rather than perceptions of influence or responsiveness. Edge cases: work on “democratic efficacy” or “self-efficacy” counts only if explicitly tied to internal/external political efficacy; papers that mention efficacy in passing without constructs, items, or analyses should be treated as only weakly relevant.
928	corona	Information about the COVID-19 (“corona”) pandemic’s societal, economic, and political impacts, with emphasis on German surveys and policy responses alongside effects in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa and links to Brexit. Topics include mental health, work and childcare, education, rule compliance, and outcomes for vulnerable groups.	A document is relevant if it uses “corona” to refer to the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, including substantive discussion of public health measures, social and economic impacts, surveys or studies (e.g., a “Corona Study” on Germany), or analyses of behavior, mental health, education, and policy during the corona crisis. Articles that link other topics (such as Brexit, African trade, or EU politics) to pandemic effects are also relevant when the pandemic is a main focus rather than a brief aside. Non-relevant cases include uses of “corona” with different meanings (solar corona in astronomy, electrical corona discharge, Corona beer, place names like Corona, California) or appearances only as part of unrelated words (coronation, coronary). Edge cases: capitalized “Corona” in German typically denotes COVID-19 and is relevant; pieces that use only “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2” without the word “corona” can still match the user intent; protests or “Corona rules” discussions are relevant if they substantively address the pandemic. Documents that merely name-drop “corona” without analysis, or historical comparisons (e.g., SARS 2003) that don’t tie back to the current pandemic, should be considered weakly relevant or non-relevant.
9616	politikverdrossenheit	The user seeks an evidence-based overview of Politikverdrossenheit (political disaffection) in Germany—its definitions and dimensions, measurement and trends, and differences between East/West and youth/adults. They also want research on causes (trust, media, socio-economic and socialization factors), consequences for voting behavior (including support for extremist parties), and potential remedies such as political education, e-government, and direct democracy.	A document is relevant if it explicitly defines or analyzes Politikverdrossenheit (e.g., disinterest, distrust of politicians, low democracy satisfaction), breaks it into dimensions, or compares its levels across groups or regions, such as youth versus adults or East versus West Germany, ideally using surveys like ALLBUS or the European Social Survey. Studies that test causes or consequences count as relevant, for example showing an interaction between right-wing attitudes and disillusionment in voting for the Republikaner, linking negative media coverage to higher disaffection, or evaluating whether e-democracy or direct democracy alleviates it. Conceptual clarifications, synonyms (e.g., Parteienverdrossenheit), and frameworks like Easton’s political support or the polity–politics–policy triad, as well as implications for political education, also indicate relevance. Non-relevant are pieces that only name the term in passing, discuss mediatization or voter behavior without connecting to political disillusionment, or focus on other countries without linking disaffection to outcomes; by contrast, a French politics analysis that ties party dynamics to rising disillusionment would still be relevant. Edge cases include normative essays arguing disillusionment is “normal” (relevant if they explain mechanisms) and studies measuring trust or democracy satisfaction without the label “Politikverdrossenheit” (potentially relevant if they operationalize its components).
974	psychische gesundheit	The user seeks an evidence-based overview of mental health, focusing on how social, economic, and environmental stressors (war, unemployment, migration, social media, workplace conditions, COVID-19, caregiving, incarceration) impact different populations. They want findings on prevalence, causal pathways, and effective prevention, treatment, and policy/intervention strategies.	For the query “psychische gesundheit,” a document is relevant if it substantively addresses mental health outcomes, symptoms, wellbeing, services, or determinants, using concrete indicators or measures (e.g., depression, anxiety, psychische Symptome, Wohlbefinden) and discussing evidence, prevalence, interventions, or policy. Examples of strong matches include analyses of war-related mental health impacts in Ukraine, meta-analyses on unemployment or caregiving and mental health, pandemic studies on children’s psychological distress, workplace reports on psychische Belastungen, or research on social media comparisons and mental wellbeing. Documents are less relevant if they focus mainly on physical health or organizational topics and mention mental health only in passing, or if “Gesundheit” is treated broadly without specific psychological content. Edge cases that still count as relevant include sociological or resilience frameworks (e.g., Kohärenzgefühl, social exclusion/identity theory, JD-R in prisons) when they employ mental health indicators or outcomes; by contrast, purely conceptual discussions of health systems that name “psychische” without data or concrete implications for mental health are marginal. Use of related German terms (psychische Erkrankungen, psychosomatisch, Lebenszufriedenheit as a mental-health proxy) and the presence of quantitative findings (effect sizes, rates, longitudinal evidence) further increase relevance.
21585	linksrechtsskala	The searcher wants a clear definition and practical overview of the "links–rechts–skala" (left–right political self‑placement scale), including how it is measured and used in surveys and research. They are likely seeking information on different scale formats and orientations, validity and interpretation issues, and the scale's relevance for groups like young people and cross‑national comparisons.	A document is relevant to the keyword "linksrechtsskala" when it explicitly treats the left–right political scale (e.g., mentions "LinksRechtsSkala", "left–right scale", or gives self‑placement items such as "0 = left, 10 = right"), reports empirical results from such scales, or analyzes how that scale is constructed, presented, or interpreted (for example questionnaire experiments varying horizontal/vertical orientation, youth interviews about what "left" and "right" mean, or manifesto-based left–right positionings). Sections that compare ideological dimensions (economic vs. socio‑cultural left–right axes), present typologies of political positioning, or use comparative party/program data to derive left–right scores are clearly relevant. Documents are not relevant when they discuss voting, turnout, or social structure without any left–right measure, or when "links" or "rechts" appear in non‑ideological senses (e.g., anatomical left/right, web links, or legal "Recht") and do not address political positioning. Edge cases include studies that measure related concepts (political interest, trust, or partisanship) and report left–right only as a background variable—these are partially relevant if they provide the actual scale items or analysis, but less so if they only use the label without detail.
21895	linksrechts	Looking for research and empirical evidence on what Germans mean by the political labels "left" and "right" — which coherent conceptions exist (e.g., economic, cultural, system-oriented or emotional) and how social-structural factors (education, class, age, East/West region) shape those associations. Also want studies using ALLBUS and similar surveys on measurement issues (e.g., middle category), how meanings changed over time, and the implications for voting behavior and political participation.	A document is relevant to the keyword "linksrechts" when it substantively treats the political left–right dimension — for example, analyses of left/right self‑placement, semantic associations with "links" and "rechts," survey results (ALLBUS, Politbarometer, ISSP), measurement methods (e.g., correspondence analysis like CAGalt), or how social structure (education, region, age, class) shapes left–right concepts. Concrete signals of relevance are discussion of ideological concepts (economic vs. cultural vs. system‑related meanings), empirical findings about variation in associations, or case studies that connect movements or attitudes (e.g., "MosaikLinke," Montagsmahnwachen, antisemitism) to left–right positioning. A document is non‑relevant if the words "links" or "rechts" appear only incidentally (hyperlinks, anatomical left/right, layout directions), occur in metadata or lists without substantive treatment, or if the piece focuses on unrelated measurement issues without applying them to left–right ideology. Ambiguous edge cases include studies of extremism or prejudice — these are relevant only when they explicitly link those phenomena to left/right self‑placement or use the left–right dimension as an analytical variable.
317	homeoffice	Information on the prevalence, access, use and effects of home office (remote/mobile work) — including who can work from home, how much work is done and recognised there, impacts on productivity, wellbeing and gender/social inequalities, and organisational or spatial consequences. The query also seeks empirical findings from German surveys (e.g. BIBB‑BAuA, SOEP, ALLBUS, LPP/LLP, DEAS), changes driven by COVID‑19, and related legal and policy implications.	A document is relevant to the keyword "homeoffice" when it explicitly treats working from home (homeoffice/telework/remote work) — for example by reporting prevalence rates, access and usage patterns, contractual recognition, sectoral or regional breakdowns, demographic differences (age, gender, class), effects on productivity, mental health or work–life balance, or legal and organizational regulations introduced during the pandemic. Highly relevant items include representative surveys that give percentages of employees who work from home, longitudinal comparisons (pre/post‑COVID), studies of homeoffice arrangements and equipment, and evaluations of policy or company rules that enable or restrict homeworking. Documents that focus only on general digitalization, industrial automation, or office employment without saying where the work is done are non‑relevant or only marginally relevant. Edge cases include research on coworking, mobile work or digital collaboration tools — these are partially relevant if they explicitly compare or situate those modes with homeoffice, and policy papers on childcare/lockdowns are relevant only if they measure homeoffice uptake or consequences. Finally, consider methodology and context: small qualitative case studies or single‑firm reports may be informative but less generalizable than large representative surveys, and region‑ or language‑specific statistics (e.g. German datasets) matter for scope.
6346	worklifebalance	A search for "worklifebalance" seeks a concise overview of the concept, its common workplace and policy measures (e.g., flexible hours, telework, parental leave, childcare) and the evidence on their benefits and risks. It also aims to understand practical implementation challenges and gendered effects (career impacts, long‑hours culture, boundary‑setting) to guide employers, HR professionals and policymakers.	A document is relevant to the keyword "worklifebalance" when its primary topic is the reconciliation of work and private life (often labelled WLB, work‑life balance, or Vereinbarkeit), or when it provides substantive discussion of measures, policies or practices such as flexible hours, part‑time work, teleworking/home‑office, childcare/eldercare provision, parental leave, managerial implementation, or empirical studies of the long‑hours culture. Practical case studies (e.g. in academia, corporate HR, public administration), evaluations of WLB programmes, cross‑country comparisons, gendered analyses (fathers, mothers intersectionality) and COVID‑era home‑office impacts are all clearly relevant examples. A document is non‑relevant if WLB is only mentioned in passing (e.g. a long bibliography or a glossary entry), if the focus is on an unrelated theme (e.g. pure diversity theory without any WLB measures), or if the term appears solely as a metaphor with no substantive treatment of work–private boundary issues. Edge cases to watch for: relevant material may be in other languages (German texts using WorkLifeBalance/WLB), use variant spellings/acronyms, or treat WLB critically (e.g. as self‑exploitation) — these are still relevant but may require attention to scope (policy vs. critique) and context (national labour law, sector, or methodology).
