100	immigrant	The user seeks methods for classifying immigrant background in German survey data (especially the Microcensus 2005–2009) and for measuring immigrants’ educational attainment. They need guidance on coding schemes, survey instrument options, and SAS/SPSS/Stata implementations, including approaches used in SOEP and NEPS.	A document is relevant to the query “immigrant” when it substantively addresses immigrants as a population—such as classification of immigrant background, integration, outcomes, or policies—rather than merely mentioning the term. The provided paragraph is clearly relevant because it centers on classifying immigrant background in the German Microcensus, measuring immigrants’ educational attainment, and survey instruments (SOEP/NEPS) tailored to people with foreign qualifications. Materials that use close synonyms or related constructs (migrants, foreign-born, immigration studies) also count, while pieces focused on emigration, internal/domestic migration, or unrelated uses (e.g., a film titled “The Immigrant”) are non-relevant. Methodological texts are relevant if immigrants are the primary analytic target (e.g., coding foreign credentials or deriving years of education for migrant respondents), but not if immigrants are only a passing example in a generic methods discussion. Edge cases include metadata-only hits or bibliographies where “immigrant” appears without substantive content about immigrant populations, which should be treated as non-relevant.
10109	politik	The user seeks information on survey instruments and pretested questionnaire modules measuring political interest, socio-political attitudes, engagement, and self-efficacy in German studies. They want details from projects like PIAAC-L, GLES 2021, LoneCovid, and RISS, including topics covered and the cognitive interview methods used.	A document is relevant to the query “politik” if it substantively covers political topics such as political interest, socio-political attitudes, engagement, trust in politics, or election research—for example, scales on political interest, modules from the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) about politics and society, or measures of political alienation and engagement. Content describing how projects examine political behavior or attitudes (e.g., trust in politics during Covid-19, compliance with political measures, youth self-efficacy in political contexts) is clearly relevant. Documents that only mention politics tangentially—such as referring to “policy and practice” dissemination in a methods or infrastructure description without analyzing political phenomena—are less relevant. Purely methodological passages (e.g., cognitive interview procedures) are non-relevant unless tied to measuring political constructs. Edge cases include projects centered on social or educational topics that still include explicit political variables (e.g., self-efficacy in political life), which should be considered relevant, whereas occurrences of “Politik” only in institutional names or boilerplate should not.
10418	politic	The user is looking for an overview of validated instruments to measure political attitudes and behaviors (e.g., efficacy, cynicism, participation, conservatism, national/pride), including their psychometric properties, translations, and cross-national comparability. They also seek guidance on using web tracking data for political research and expert insights on social media’s impact on democracy.	A document is relevant to the query “politic” when it substantively discusses politics, political behavior, political systems, or political attitudes, including morphological variants like political, politics, politician, and politicization. The provided paragraph is highly relevant because it centers on political constructs and measures (e.g., political participation subscales, PEKS/PESS efficacy scales, Perceived Political Self-Efficacy, system satisfaction, conservatism, national and political pride, partisan identity) and connects methods like web tracking to topics in political communication and democracy, even featuring an interview about social media’s impact on democratic processes. Methodological content remains relevant when it directly measures or analyzes political phenomena (e.g., validity, reliability, and cross-national invariance of political scales), whereas a purely technical web-tracking guide without any link to political outcomes would be less relevant. Non-relevant matches would include uses of “politic” meaning “prudent” in etiquette or business advice, or incidental mentions (e.g., a citation list where “political” appears without substantive discussion). Edge cases include terms like “body politic” or debates about the “politicization” of research; these are relevant if they engage political institutions, attitudes, or behavior, but borderline if they only invoke the term metaphorically without political content.
1112	politisches interesse	The user is seeking survey instruments and validated items for measuring political interest, especially brief scales from CSES Module 5 within German pretest studies, including item wording and psychometric properties. They also want context on related constructs (e.g., political efficacy, cynicism) and how these measures were cognitively tested and implemented.	A document is relevant if it directly defines, measures, or reports on “politisches Interesse” (political interest), for example by describing a two‑item scale asking how interested respondents are in politics or by detailing modules like CSES that include political interest items. It is also relevant if it discusses pretests, validation, reliability, or cognitive interviewing of political-interest measures, or uses political interest as a key variable in explaining participation or vote choice. Documents that focus only on adjacent constructs—political efficacy (PEKS), political cynicism (KPZ), conservatism (SECS GER), asylum attitudes, or environmental engagement—are non‑relevant unless they explicitly include a political-interest item or subscale. References to datasets, coding tools, or infrastructure without a tie to measuring interest (e.g., CAMCES for education, migration-typology coding, regional keys like AGS/NUTS) are non‑relevant. Edge cases include inventories that merely name political interest among many topics (minimally relevant), synonym phrasing like Politikinteresse or “Interesse an Politik” (relevant), and uses of “interest” in the economic sense (interest rates or inflation expectations) which are not relevant.
1156	religion	The user is seeking details on psychological measures related to religion, specifically scales that assess parental religious upbringing/religiosity and the thought–action fusion construct (including the “moral religion” subdimension). They want to understand how these instruments operationalize family socialization factors and relate to attitudes toward in- and out-groups.	A document is relevant to the query “religion” if it substantively discusses religiosity, religious upbringing, or moral-religious dimensions—for example, describing how parents’ religiosity shapes children’s in-group/out-group attitudes or detailing a “moral religion (MR)” subscale within a psychological measure. Content that operationalizes religion (e.g., items measuring parental religious socialization or thought-action fusion specifically in moral-religious contexts) also counts as relevant because it treats religion as a construct under study, not just a passing mention. By contrast, a document is non-relevant if “religion” appears only tangentially (such as a brief label in a scale with no further treatment) or if the focus is purely on general cognitive bias without any specific religious dimension. Edge cases include texts that use acronyms like MR without clarifying the religious component, or that discuss “spirituality” or “faith” as proxies for religiosity—these can be relevant if they explicitly connect to religious beliefs or practices, but not if they remain entirely secular or metaphorical.
11910	persönlichkeit	The user is looking for German-language psychometric instruments to measure personality and related constructs—such as Big Five (BFI-10), right-wing authoritarianism, social desirability (KSE-G), interpersonal trust/morality, and attitudes toward military interventions—along with evidence of their validity/reliability and guidelines for documenting survey measures in social and behavioral research.	A document is relevant to the query “persönlichkeit” if it focuses on personality as a psychological construct, its theories, or its measurement—e.g., discussing the Big Five (BFI-10), authoritarian personality/Right-Wing Authoritarianism (Altemeyer’s subdimensions), PASK5, 16PF, or NEO-PI-R, and how these tools capture individual differences. Content that links attitudes (trust/mistrust, moral judgments, acceptance of military interventions) explicitly to personality models or scales is also relevant—for instance, using RWA items to operationalize authoritarian aggression or conventionalism. Methodological discussions are relevant when they document or validate personality instruments or adjacent controls like social desirability (KSE-G) in the context of personality assessment; they are less relevant if they only outline generic survey documentation standards without a clear tie to personality constructs. Non-relevant items include uses of “Persönlichkeit” in non-psychological senses (brand personality, character in literature), legal topics like Persönlichkeitsrecht, or policy analyses of military interventions that do not operationalize personality. Edge cases include scales like KSE-G: relevant when used to interpret or adjust personality data, but not when presented in isolation unrelated to personality measurement.
12195	persönlichkeitsmerkmale	The user is seeking information on personality traits as measured by German-language instruments, such as mood (Stimmungsskala) and self-control scales, including their theoretical bases. They also want to understand how these traits are used as determinants in research on conceptions of democracy and preferences for democratic procedures.	A document is relevant if it explicitly discusses personality traits (Persönlichkeitsmerkmale) as stable dispositions, defines or theorizes them, or presents instruments that measure them—for example, a mood scale conceptualized as a trait with factors like mood disposition and reactivity, or a 23-item Self-Control Scale grounded in Gottfredson and Hirschi’s theory. Content linking traits to outcomes (e.g., how self-control relates to deviant behavior) or to broader research contexts (such as determinants of democratic procedure preferences) also counts as relevant. It may be partially relevant if it mentions personality traits only as one of several determinants without detailing them, or if it uses near-synonyms like trait, disposition, or Eigenschaft. Non-relevant would be texts that treat mood purely as a transient state rather than a trait, or that use “Merkmale” to mean demographics or procedural attributes (e.g., features of democratic processes) with no substantive treatment of personality constructs. Edge cases include mixed-methods pretests where traits are noted but not operationalized, or surveys that list “Persönlichkeitsmerkmale” without providing scales, definitions, or examples.
1259	sexuelle orientierung	The user seeks documentation on how sexual orientation is measured in German social surveys, especially the FReDA panel (waves 6a and 2b), including the specific items, their development/adaptation, and results of cognitive online pretests (web probing). They want to understand the survey context (e.g., household composition, fertility, affective touch, transnational families) in which these sexual orientation questions are embedded.	A document is relevant to “sexuelle orientierung” when it directly discusses sexual orientation as a survey topic, measure, or analytical focus—for example, the FReDA W6a and W2b modules that include questions on household composition and sexual orientation, affective touch, and support in transnational families, with details on cognitive pretesting via web probing. By contrast, many uses of “Orientierung” here are unrelated (e.g., collective/team orientation, political left–right orientation, religious orientation, causal orientations) and should not be considered matches for sexual orientation. Mentions such as the fascism scale’s “Überbetonung des Sexuellen,” general gender equality items, or family climate scales concern other constructs and are non-relevant to the query. An edge case is when sexual orientation is only listed among many topics without item detail; that can be borderline, but tying it to specific FReDA waves and instruments increases relevance. Content on climate change, managerial practices, or guidelines for online survey documentation is unrelated and should not influence retrieval for this query.
12604	personal	The user seeks social science survey resources centered on “personal” constructs and person-based classifications. This includes personality and personal norm/responsibility scales, questionnaires on personal behaviors (e.g., cancer screening, technophobia), and methodological guidance on web paradata and identifying chief income earners and cohabiting unions in the German Microcensus.	A document is relevant to the query “personal” if it discusses individual-level attributes, behaviors, norms, or data, or explicitly contrasts personal versus non-personal information. In this paragraph, relevant content includes measures and questionnaires about personal cancer screening, personal ecological responsibility, personal norms for environmentally friendly behavior (global and traffic-specific), “personal failure” as a technophobia dimension, and domains like Personal Intelligence; the guideline on web paradata is also relevant where it distinguishes personal from non-personal paradata and addresses consent. By contrast, material focused on “person” or “persons” in a demographic sense (e.g., chief income earner, household reference person, advance letters to target persons, microcensus methodology) is non-relevant if it doesn’t address “personal” attributes or data. Edge cases include morphological or substring matches such as “personality” (relevant only if the discussion is about personal traits in a way that aligns with the query’s intent) and “non-personal” (may still be relevant when it helps define or contrast what counts as personal). Mentions where “personal” appears only incidentally or as part of unrelated administrative phrasing should be treated as non-relevant.
1293	alcohol	The user is seeking information on alcohol addiction assessment tools, specifically biographical questionnaires that evaluate personality dimensions (e.g., neuroticism, socialization, goal orientation) and emphasize life‑history factors.	A document is relevant to the query “alcohol” when it directly addresses alcohol use or misuse, such as addiction, assessment, treatment, health effects, policy, or consumption patterns. The provided paragraph is relevant because it focuses on a biographical questionnaire designed for alcohol addicts, detailing personality dimensions and its life-history focus—useful for research or clinical assessment of alcoholism. However, it would be non-relevant for intents about the chemistry of alcohols, beverage information, legal limits, or physiological effects, since it doesn’t discuss ethanol properties, drinking guidelines, or health outcomes. Examples of relevant content include diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder, validation of screening tools (e.g., AUDIT), or studies on therapy outcomes; non-relevant examples include generic personality inventories with no alcohol linkage or articles where “alcohol” appears only in a citation. Edge cases include psychometric tool development papers that use alcohol-dependent samples (still relevant if the tool targets alcoholism) versus chemistry texts using “alcohols” generically (irrelevant to the lay “alcohol” intent).
1326	demokratie	The user seeks information on a study of how Germans conceive of democracy and what determines their preferences for democratic decision-making procedures. It examines attitudes toward majority rule versus minority protection, direct democracy, and the role of national pride in democratic stability.	A document is relevant to the query “demokratie” if it substantively discusses democracy as a political system or idea—for example, theories or conceptions of democracy, public preferences over democratic procedures, trade-offs like majority rule versus minority rights, or instruments such as direct democracy. Empirical studies about attitudes toward democracy in Germany, including survey designs, pretests, and methods (e.g., web probing) are relevant when they are applied to democratic topics, as in research on how citizens weigh procedures. Content linking adjacent themes—such as how national pride might affect democratic stability, system acceptance, or civic cohesion—is also relevant when the connection to democracy is explicit. By contrast, pages that only mention “Demokratie” in passing (e.g., a slogan, a footer link, or a bibliography entry), or that use it solely in proper names (e.g., “Demokratische Republik Kongo”) without discussing democratic governance, are not relevant. Edge cases include methodological texts: if they describe survey methods with no democratic substance, they are non-relevant; if those methods are used to probe democratic attitudes or procedures, they are relevant.
13621	kultur	The user seeks information on culture-related constructs and validated measurement tools—acculturation orientations of migrants, attitudes toward outgroups, motivations for intergroup contact, and value scales. They also need methodological guidance for cross-cultural survey research, including defining household size and standardizing/harmonizing socio-demographic variables for comparability.	A document is relevant to the query “kultur” when it directly addresses culture or acculturation—such as intercultural contact, heritage vs host culture (Herkunftskultur/Aufnahmekultur), intergroup attitudes toward foreign cultures, or values framed as the basis of any culture. Concrete matches include scales like AKOrM (adapted from the Vancouver Index of Acculturation), inventories measuring motives for contact with people from other cultures, IRV value measures that situate values within cultural frameworks, and discussions of harmonizing survey variables across different cultures or how household definitions vary between cultures. Content is non-relevant when “Kultur” appears only incidentally (e.g., in a ministry’s name) or in sections unrelated to cultural themes (e.g., mathematical modeling self-efficacy) unless explicitly tied to cultural context; purely technical psychometric details without a cultural lens also reduce relevance. Edge cases include compound or inflected forms (Kulturen, interkulturell, Herkunftskultur) which are strong positives, versus uses of “culture” in non-social senses (e.g., laboratory cultures) that are false positives. Generic discussions of demographic standardization are only tangential unless they explicitly address cross-cultural comparability.
1537	social media	The user seeks expert, research-based guidance on social media within computational social science. They want methods and ethical insights for analyzing text and images, collecting and linking web/mobile behavioral data, and addressing misinformation, fairness, vulnerable communities, and impacts on democracy.	A document is relevant if it explicitly examines social media platforms, behaviors, data, or effects—for example, interviews about detecting misinformation on social platforms, analyses of visual content in political online communication, linking survey responses to social media traces, or reviews of social media’s impact on democracy. Guides or methods (e.g., web tracking, mobile data collection) are relevant when they are applied to studying social media use or extracting social media content, but are peripheral if they focus on general online behavior without a platform link. Content about vulnerable communities’ online communications or information quality is relevant when it analyzes their activity on social platforms. By contrast, sections centered on psychometric scales and questionnaires about social policy, workplace stress, social trust, or left-right ideology without a social media component are non-relevant. Edge cases include “media-based empathy” or algorithmic fairness pieces: they qualify only if they specify social media contexts or datasets, not if they discuss media or socio-technical systems in the abstract.
15423	jugendliche	The user seeks an overview of validated German-language questionnaires and short psychometric scales for children and adolescents across diverse constructs (e.g., family climate, delinquency, identity, physical activity, growth mindset, self-efficacy, personality, empathy, need for cognition, impostor), including item content, subscales, translations, and evidence of reliability, validity, and cognitive pretesting.	A document is relevant if it centers on adolescents (Jugendliche) as the target group—typically ages ~10–19—and explicitly discusses their behaviors, traits, attitudes, or measurement instruments (e.g., scales on delinquency, family climate, identity, physical activity, growth mindset, self-efficacy, Big Five youth versions, authoritarian attitudes, media-based empathy, Need for Cognition Teens, or impostor self-concept). Studies and pretests using adolescent samples, including German-language tools or translations (e.g., Turkish/Arabic for Muslim adolescents in Germany), are highly relevant. A document is non-relevant if it focuses exclusively on adults or only on younger children, or if “jugendliche” appears only tangentially (such as marketing phrases like “jugendliche Haut” or stylistic uses) without substantive youth content. Edge cases: materials covering “Kinder und Jugendliche” are relevant if adolescents are a substantial subgroup or results are reported for them; work on “young adults” is relevant only if it includes or directly compares adolescent samples. Legal, historical, or theoretical mentions of “Jugendliche” without empirical or topical focus on adolescent populations are generally less relevant.
1552	religiosität	The user is looking for a German-language measure of religiosity—the Religious Commitment Scale—and its five items for use in clinical research. They also seek related measures of parental behavior (supportive care and religious socialization) to examine links to norms, values, and in-/out-group orientations.	A document is relevant if it directly addresses Religiosität (religiosity) as an attitude or commitment toward religion and its institutions, especially if it discusses measurement (e.g., the Religious Commitment Scale), dimensions of religious commitment, or links religiosity to socio-cultural norms and ingroup orientations. Content describing a German version of such a scale, clinical or psychological research on religiosity, or parental socialization dimensions related to religious upbringing (e.g., “Erziehung zur Religion”) is highly relevant. Documents that only mention general parenting warmth without connecting it to parental religiosity, or that discuss religion theologically without addressing individual religiosity/commitment or its assessment, are less relevant. Edge cases include papers that use religiosity merely as a control variable, texts focusing on “spirituality” without explicit religiosity measures, or mentions of religiosity limited to citations—these would be only marginally or non-relevant unless they provide substantive, measurable treatment of religiosity.
15721	job	The user is seeking guidance on how to capture and code job-related data in surveys. They want validated measures for job satisfaction/employee experience and transparency, plus procedures, software, and classification schemes (KldB 2010, ISCO-08) to code occupations and derive status/prestige indices like ISEI, SIOPS, and ISEC.	A document is relevant to the query “job” if it discusses employment or occupations in a substantive way, such as measuring job satisfaction or employee experience, describing occupational classifications (e.g., ISCO-08, KldB 2010), or explaining how job-related data are coded and used in analyses (ISEI, SIOPS, ISEC). For example, studies presenting psychometric scales of job satisfaction or engagement, or guides to coding job titles into standardized occupation categories, directly answer the query’s intent. It may also be relevant when adjacent constructs (like organizational transparency) are empirically linked to job satisfaction or workplace outcomes. Non-relevant uses include “Job” as a biblical figure, “job” as a computing batch process, or casual uses like “did a good job” that don’t pertain to employment. Edge cases include documents that use “occupation,” “role,” or “position” without the word “job” (still relevant), versus papers on transparency or surveys that only mention “job” in passing without analyzing employment constructs (likely not relevant).
15758	job satisfaction	The user is seeking validated instruments and survey scales to assess job satisfaction and related employee experience constructs, including their dimensions (e.g., colleagues, supervisor, work conditions, pay) and evidence of reliability and validity for use in organizational or social surveys.	A document is relevant if it directly measures, analyzes, or explains job satisfaction in the workplace, for example multi-item job satisfaction scales with subdimensions such as colleagues, supervisor, pay, development, working conditions, and activity, or broader instruments like the Employee Experience Questionnaire that explicitly includes a job satisfaction construct with validated psychometrics. Studies linking work characteristics to job satisfaction—e.g., task variety, autonomy (freedom of decision), mental job requirements, or organizational transparency dimensions tied to job satisfaction—are also relevant. Edge cases include instruments where job satisfaction is one facet among others (employee experience or flourishing indices), occupation-specific measures (e.g., teachers’ occupational satisfaction with pay and working atmosphere), or language adaptations/validations that are used to assess job satisfaction in organizational contexts. Non-relevant content focuses on satisfaction outside the job domain (general life or study satisfaction, political system satisfaction), occupational coding/classification (ISCO/KldB) without attitudinal outcomes, or personality/affect scales (optimism, cross-cultural loss) unless they explicitly examine effects on job satisfaction. Similarly, measures of customer orientation or customer satisfaction are only tangentially relevant unless they connect to employees’ job satisfaction.
1635	depression	The user is seeking information on assessing depression in students using questionnaire-based scales—such as the Giessen Test grounded in Beck’s depression model—to screen for psychosocial impairment and understand links with procrastination and social factors.	A document is relevant to the query “depression” if it discusses depressive symptoms, diagnosis, theory, or measurement—for example, describing vegetative symptoms, depressive mood, or scales grounded in the Beck depression model, as with the Giessen Test short scales measuring “depressivity” and psychological impairment. Materials that present validated screening tools, psychosocial constructs tied to depression (e.g., social rejection, unsteadiness), or preventive interventions for depression count as relevant even if the focus is on assessment rather than treatment. Content that only mentions related behaviors like procrastination is relevant if it explicitly links them to depressive affect or cognitions (e.g., “depressive moods,” irrational thoughts) but not if procrastination is discussed without a depression connection. Non-relevant items are those using “depression” in non-mental-health senses (economic or geological depression) or that list “depression” as a passing term without substantive detail. Edge cases include texts using near-synonyms (“depressivity”) or focusing on comorbid psychosomatic/vegetative complaints; these remain relevant when they are framed within a depression model or screening context.
16523	klimaschutz	The user is looking for information on a University of Hamburg study in climate protection that tests how the complexity of intervention texts influences intrinsic motivation using a field experiment. They also want details on the cognitive pretesting of the baseline information text via telephone interviews to ensure comprehension and decision-making.	A document is relevant to the query “klimaschutz” if it substantively addresses climate protection—such as mitigation policies, interventions, programs, or research on behaviors and communication that aim to reduce emissions—even when framed through methodology (e.g., field experiments, cognitive pretests) so long as the focus remains on Klimaschutz actions or decisions. German-language content is fully relevant, and related terminology like mitigation, CO2 reduction, emissions targets, or institutional initiatives (e.g., university or government projects) also qualifies. Non-relevant items include pages that only mention “Klimaschutz” in passing (navigation labels, event lists), texts about climate change broadly without protective measures, or cases where the term appears in a name without environmental context. Edge cases include methodological studies on complexity or motivation that never tie findings to climate-protection behaviors; these are borderline unless they explicitly connect to Klimaschutz interventions or decision-making. The provided paragraph is relevant because it describes a research project testing how information complexity affects decisions in a climate-protection intervention and outlines its cognitive interview pretesting.
1719	vertrauen	The user seeks information on German social research and survey measures of trust (Vertrauen) across domains—interpersonal, institutional, leadership, and self-presentation—including validated scales (e.g., KUSIV3) and pretest methodologies. They want to understand how trust is measured and how factors like COVID-19, media use, and survey methods influence trust levels.	A document is relevant to the query “vertrauen” if it substantively discusses trust as a concept or measure, for example describing interpersonal trust scales like KUSIV3, trust as part of leader–employee relationship quality, or trust in politics, science, and survey results. Content that operationalizes or evaluates trust or mistrust through items, subscales, or pretest findings—such as items capturing Vertrauen/Misstrauen toward others, trust in bodily self-presentation, or links between media use and social trust—is also clearly relevant. Materials where trust is only a peripheral mention within broader topics (e.g., panels on partnership status or dietary styles) are borderline unless they explicitly analyze trust or report measurements or effects tied to it. Non-relevant content would focus on unrelated constructs (e.g., communication access) without connecting them to trust, or use “Vertrauen” only in passing or as boilerplate. Edge cases include documents centered on Misstrauen (mistrust) without the word Vertrauen—which should still be treated as relevant—and instances where trust is bundled within composite indices; conversely, occurrences in titles or metadata without analytic content would not qualify.
1743	lebenszufriedenheit	The user wants German-language, validated measures and research for assessing life satisfaction and broader subjective well-being, including item wording, response scales, and validation. This includes the German SWLS, the SOEP single-item L1, the Human Flourishing Scale (FI/SFI), and studies on ranking-based measures and DDR-specific surveys.	A document is relevant if it directly measures, validates, or conceptually defines Lebenszufriedenheit (life satisfaction), for example by presenting or testing scales like the SWLS (Diener et al.), the SOEP single-item L-1 with its 11-point response options, RankMe’s ranking approach, or German translations/psychometrics and cognitive pretests (web probing, telephone interviews). It is also relevant if broader wellbeing instruments (e.g., the Human Flourishing Scale with FI/SFI) explicitly include life satisfaction as a dimension or report findings about it, or if it discusses the affective vs. cognitive evaluative components of life satisfaction in line with Diener. Partially relevant cases include studies where life satisfaction is one of several outcomes (e.g., DDR participation surveys that also ask about Lebenszufriedenheit) or where related constructs like Lebensfreude/Wohlbefinden are covered only insofar as they tie back to life satisfaction measurement. Non-relevant documents focus on other satisfactions (job/customer satisfaction), general political engagement without life satisfaction content, or mention the term only in passing without items, methods, or results. Edge cases include purely theoretical happiness narratives without link to measurement, or flourishing work that omits explicit life satisfaction indicators—these would be weakly or not relevant.
1817	mediennutzung	The user is seeking research on media use and its psychological correlates—specifically how media-based empathy is conceptualized and measured (MBE scale) and how media use and video game immersion relate to empathy, aggression, and cyberbullying across age groups.	A document is relevant to the query “mediennutzung” when it treats media use as a core concept—defining it, measuring it, or analyzing its patterns, contexts, or effects—rather than merely naming it. The paragraph is relevant because it operationalizes media-related behaviors (e.g., mediale Anteilnahme and immersion in video games) and explicitly ties them to Mediennutzung via construct validity, with evidence across youth and adult samples. A document would be non-relevant if it focuses on empathy, aggression, or cyberbullying without examining media-use behavior, frequency, platforms, or if “Mediennutzung” appears only as a passing correlate or control. Edge cases include psychometric studies that reference Mediennutzung solely to validate another scale (tangentially relevant) or pieces centered on a single mode like gaming immersion, which is a form of media use but may not satisfy searches for broad usage patterns or statistics.
1825	glaubwürdigkeit	The user is seeking information on “credibility” (Glaubwürdigkeit) in a social-policy context, specifically how the perceived authenticity/credibility of asylum applications and related justice ideologies are conceptualized and measured in surveys across European countries.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses “Glaubwürdigkeit” (credibility) as a concept, especially in contexts like evaluating the authenticity of asylum applications, measuring perceived credibility, or discussing why certain beliefs or ideologies are seen as credible by stakeholders. For example, a study that introduces a survey instrument with items capturing perceptions of the authenticity/credibility of typical asylum claims, or that argues justice ideologies possess high credibility among adherents, directly matches the query. It is less relevant if it focuses on justice ideologies or pension policy without linking them to credibility, or if “Glaubwürdigkeit” appears only as a passing word with no analytical role. Edge cases include documents using near-synonyms (Echtheit, Vertrauenswürdigkeit), negations (Unglaubwürdigkeit), or domain-specific uses like “credible commitment” or actuarial “credibility” that may be relevant only if the text clearly concerns credibility in the intended sense. Mentions of “Glaubwürdigkeit” in unrelated contexts (e.g., a brief citation note or a tangential example) would be marginally relevant at best.
18263	mitarbeiter	The query seeks German-language measurement instruments and literature on employee-related constructs—especially supervisor–employee communication quality, leadership/LMX, organizational commitment, acculturation, job performance, and customer orientation—along with guidance on interviewer recruitment, training, and quality assurance to minimize interviewer effects.	A document is relevant if it centers on employees (Mitarbeiter) and closely related constructs, explicitly using the term or clear variants such as MitarbeiterInnen, Mitarbeitende, or compounds like Mitarbeiterbindung/Mitarbeiterbefragung. Examples of strong relevance include content on leader–employee communication quality, LMX7 from the employee perspective, the OCQ measuring employees’ affective organizational commitment, and customer orientation of service employees. Synonyms or role labels like Untergebene, Beschäftigte, or “employee–supervisor” relationship measures also count, even when framed through leadership or exchange theory. Non-relevant or weakly relevant items are those where “Mitarbeiter” appears only incidentally (e.g., in citations, staff directories) or where the focus is unrelated (e.g., a general acculturation model or interviewer training that mentions staff but is not about employees as a subject). Edge cases include pages focused mainly on supervisors with minimal employee context, gender-inclusive spellings (Mitarbeiter:innen) that should still match, and English-only “employee” content that is topically relevant but may not be retrieved by a strict German keyword match.
1851	education	The user seeks guidance on how to conceptualize, operationalize, and code educational attainment in German and cross-national surveys, including handling migrants’ foreign qualifications and applying classification schemes like CASMIN, ISCED, or years of education. They also want pointers to validated survey instruments for educational attitudes, aspirations, competencies, and related constructs used in large-scale studies.	This document is relevant to the query “education” because it directly defines and operationalizes education as highest attainment and details how to measure and code it in surveys, including cross-national schemes like CASMIN and ISCED, derivation of years of education, and the handling of migrant qualifications. Highly relevant examples include discussions of mapping German credentials to ISCED/CASMIN, solutions used in SOEP and NEPS, and guidance on choosing between linear, ordinal, or categorical education variables. Content that distinguishes education from competencies or fields of study, and analyses of returns to education, inequality, and educational aspirations/attitudes (when tied to decisions and outcomes) also counts as relevant. However, sections that introduce general psychometric scales (e.g., grit, curiosity, SDO, digital readiness, informal workplace learning) are only tangential unless they explicitly predict or are designed for educational settings or outcomes. Edge cases include documents that merely mention “education” without measurement or policy substance (non-relevant) versus those providing long-term, cross-survey comparability for education variables (e.g., German Microcensuses with ISCED/CASMIN), which are strongly relevant.
18589	migranten	The query seeks an overview of how acculturation and educational attainment are measured for migrants in German surveys. It focuses on instruments like AKOrM (adapted from the Vancouver Index of Acculturation), coding strategies for foreign qualifications, alternative response formats and tools, implementations in SOEP and NEPS, and remaining interpretive limitations.	A document is relevant if it explicitly discusses migrants (e.g., “Migrantinnen und Migranten,” “migrants”) and focuses on their experiences, measurement, or integration, such as acculturation scales, education credentials, or survey methodology. The given paragraph is highly relevant: it repeatedly addresses migrants, details the AKOrM acculturation framework (a German adaptation of the Vancouver Index of Acculturation), and examines how to measure education for people with foreign degrees in German surveys like SOEP and NEPS. Documents about “migration” that do not concern people (e.g., animal migration or internal firm mobility) or that only mention “Migranten” in passing (like a citation) are non-relevant. Edge cases include gendered/plural variants (Migrant, Migranten, Migrantinnen), related labels (refugees, asylum seekers), and German/English terminology; these are relevant if they clearly refer to human migrants in a comparable context. Conversely, content that uses “Migration” as a general methodological term, places the keyword only in metadata, or discusses measurement tools without linking them to migrants should be treated as non-relevant.
18995	migrant	The user is looking for guidance on how to measure and code migrants’ educational attainment and acculturation in surveys, particularly in Germany. They seek approaches for handling foreign qualifications (e.g., classifications, years-of-education, response categories, database tools) and examples from SOEP/NEPS, along with limitations and interpretation issues.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses migrants/immigrants, especially topics like acculturation, measurement of educational attainment, and survey methodology in contexts such as Germany. Strong matches include discussions of acculturation scales (e.g., the Vancouver Index, AKOrM), how surveys code foreign qualifications (German school credentials vs international classifications), derivation of years of education, and applications in datasets like SOEP or NEPS. It is not relevant if “migrant” appears only in passing, is used in an unrelated sense (e.g., migrant birds or data migration), or if education coding is discussed without linking to migrant populations. Edge cases: documents using synonymous terms (immigrants, refugees, asylum seekers) or addressing host-culture adaptation without the exact word “migrant” can still be relevant; material on internal migrants or migrant workers is only partly relevant unless it tackles comparable measurement issues (e.g., credential comparability). German-language sources on these survey tools remain relevant, while mere mentions of SOEP/NEPS without a migrant focus are marginal.
20168	muslime	The user is seeking information about a German research project that cognitively pretested a multilingual survey on religious identification, Islamist fundamentalist attitudes, and experiences with extremism among Muslim adolescents in Germany, including its methods and translations.	The query “muslime” is a German plural term for Muslims, so documents are relevant when they explicitly discuss Muslims as a group or individuals, their communities, attitudes, demographics, or experiences (including gendered/plural forms like “Musliminnen und Muslime”). The provided paragraph is relevant because it focuses on Muslim youth in Germany and examines their religious identification and attitudes, even if the specific angle is on Islamist and fundamentalist views within that population. Content that only discusses “Islam” abstractly without referring to Muslims, or that treats extremism generically without specifying Muslim groups, would be less relevant, as would texts where “Muslime” appears only in a citation, keyword list, or translation note. Edge cases include morphological variants and capitalization in German (Muslime/Musliminnen/Muslimen), related languages (e.g., “Muslims” in English), and false positives like references to “muslin” (the fabric) or brand names that coincidentally contain the string.
20775	mobilität	The user is seeking information on spatial mobility (migration) in the German Microcensus panel and how movers in/out of sampling areas create sample selectivity that can bias longitudinal analyses. They may also want methods or example programs (e.g., LEM) to assess and correct this bias.	A document is relevant if it discusses mobility in the sense of spatial movement of people—e.g., households moving out of or into sampling areas—and how this affects data, such as selection bias or attrition in longitudinal surveys (terms like räumliche Mobilität, wegziehen, zuziehen, Flächenstichprobe, Auswahlbezirke, Stichprobenselektivität, Mikrozensuspanel signal strong relevance). Content analyzing movers vs. stayers, in-/out-migration, or panel replacement due to relocation directly addresses the query. It is non-relevant if “Mobilität” refers to unrelated domains like transport policy/e-mobility, mobile technologies, or purely social/educational mobility without any spatial movement component. Edge cases include studies on educational trajectories that only mention mobility tangentially (weakly relevant), and methodological texts that do not use the word “Mobilität” but clearly describe the consequences of respondents moving; the latter can still be relevant if the movement and its effects are explicit. Mentions of the term only in citations or titles, without substantive discussion in the body, are not sufficient.
21196	motivation	The user seeks an overview of how motivation is conceptualized and measured in social science surveys, including key validated scales (achievement/performance motivation, self-efficacy, need for cognition, empathy, environmental and intercultural motives). They also want practical guidance on motivating participation (interviewer selection/training, postal survey design) and minimizing response biases.	A document is relevant if it treats motivation as a psychological driver of behavior, measures motivational constructs, or details strategies to motivate participants (e.g., in surveys). Clear examples include scales of achievement/performance motivation (hope of success, fear of failure), cognitive motivation such as Need for Cognition, self-efficacy in motivational contexts, motivated empathy, motives for intercultural contact, environmental action motivation, and status-maintenance motives. Methods content is also relevant when it focuses on motivating respondents or interviewers to participate and respond (e.g., cover letters, interviewer training), or when response biases are explicitly linked to motivational processes like satisficing. By contrast, material that only catalogs response-bias types, general survey operations, or workload measures without a substantive motivational link would be non-relevant, as would mere name-drops of “motivation” without analysis. Edge cases include constructs with motivational theory in the background but a non-motivational focus (borderline), whereas inventories labeled “motivations” that operationalize tendencies like avoidance or revenge remain relevant because they measure motivational dispositions.
2160	beruf	The user seeks guidance on coding and classifying occupations for social research, including mapping between German KldB and ISCO systems and deriving socio-economic status/prestige measures (e.g., MPS, ISEI, ESeC, SIPOS, Blossfeld). They want practical instructions, tools, and survey applications for coding methods and related scales (e.g., commitment, BOKX) in German and European contexts.	A document is relevant if it treats Beruf (occupation/profession) as a core topic, especially in German contexts such as occupational coding, classification, or measurement. Clear signals include discussion of systems like ISCO-68/08 and KldB 2010, prestige/status indices (MPS, ISEI, SIPOS), class schemes (ESeC/EGP, Blossfeld), survey instruments (BIBB-BAuA, Mikrozensus), and psychometric scales for occupational commitment or the Berufs- und Organisationsklima Index (BOKX). It also counts as relevant when the term appears in German compounds or inflected forms—e.g., Berufe, beruflich, Berufsangaben, Berufscodierung—especially when tied to methods (manual/automatic coding), recoding syntax (SPSS), or validation studies. Non-relevant cases include incidental or purely bibliographic mentions, uses of similarly spelled but different concepts (Berufung/berufen = appointment/calling), or content about “profession/occupation” only in English without the German keyword when exact-term matching is required. Edge cases: mappings between KldB and ISCO or coding software are relevant even if “Beruf” appears mostly in compounds, while labor-market analyses using only numeric occupational codes may be borderline unless their focus on occupations is explicit.
21846	links rechts	The query seeks standardized survey measures and methodological guidance on left–right political orientation, attitudes to income inequality/redistribution (PAWCER), citizenship and work-permit items in Germany, poverty metrics using the German Microcensus, and the B-RWA-6 right-wing authoritarianism short scale. The goal is to find validated items, pretest evidence, and calculation tools to ensure comparability and robust analysis across studies.	The query “links rechts” most likely targets the German Links-Rechts-Skala, i.e., measures of left–right political self-placement. A document is relevant if it defines, uses, or evaluates this scale (e.g., survey items asking respondents to place themselves on a left–right continuum), discusses methodological testing such as cognitive interviews, or links substantive attitudes (like redistribution or welfare-state views) explicitly to left–right placement. Content focused solely on other topics—citizenship/rights and work permits, poverty measurement with the Mikrozensus, or an authoritarianism scale (RWA)—is non-relevant unless it directly connects those constructs to a left–right self-placement measure. RWA may be only tangentially relevant: it measures right-wing authoritarianism, not the left–right continuum, unless the study maps RWA scores onto a left–right scale. Edge cases include variant spellings (Links-Rechts, links–rechts, LR scale) or English equivalents (“left-right scale”), and documents where “links/rechts” appears as physical directions or “Links” as hyperlinks and “Rechts” as legal rights, which should be treated as non-relevant.
21879	links rechts skala	The user is looking for information on the Left–Right political orientation scale (Links-Rechts Skala), including its purpose, standard survey wording/response format, and use in studies (e.g., PAWCER) to measure ideological self-placement and related attitudes.	A document is relevant if it directly discusses the Left–Right political self-placement measure (Links-Rechts Skala), including its question wording, response range (e.g., 0–10 or 1–7), validation or pretesting (such as cognitive interviews), or its use in surveys like PAWCER or AUTNES. It also counts as relevant if it connects left–right placement to related attitudes (e.g., income inequality/redistribution) while keeping the Left–Right scale itself central to the analysis. Documents that primarily describe other instruments—such as authoritarianism or Law-and-Order scales, Machiavellianism, social desirability, procrastination, the “Oben–Unten” social ladder, or job performance—without detailing the Left–Right measure are non-relevant. Edge cases to exclude include uses of “links”/“rechts” as spatial directions, hyperlinks/UI navigation, or “left–right” referring to handedness or other non-political dimensions. Mentions of citizenship or work-permit items are only relevant if they are explicitly used to validate, stratify, or interpret results of the Left–Right scale.
221	immigration	Information on how to classify immigrant background and measure migrants’ educational attainment in German survey data, especially the Microcensus 2005–2009. Includes coding approaches, survey instrument options, software implementations (SAS/SPSS/Stata), and known issues with foreign qualifications.	A document is relevant to the query “immigration” if it analyzes immigrants or immigration policy, measurement, or outcomes—for example, classifying “immigrant background” in the German Microcensus, evaluating costs and benefits of immigrants to Germany, or detailing how surveys capture the education of people with foreign qualifications. Methodological content tied to immigration, such as SAS/SPSS/Stata routines to derive immigrant status from 2005–2009 Microcensus data, or discussions of SOEP/NEPS instruments for coding foreign educational attainment, is also clearly relevant. By contrast, materials that discuss education coding only within the German system without addressing migrants, or that cover internal mobility or “migration” in a non-demographic sense (e.g., data/system migration), are non-relevant. Edge cases include documents using synonyms like “migration and integration” or “foreign-born” (still relevant), or focusing on emigration rather than immigration (likely less relevant unless framed in a comparative migration context). Mentions of software or statistics are relevant only if they specifically serve to identify or analyze immigrant populations and outcomes.
22708	media use	The user seeks guidance and research on measuring and analyzing media use, particularly digital and social media behavior. They want methods, instruments, and expert insights (e.g., web tracking, mobile sensing, API data, validated scales) to study impacts such as misinformation, political communication, and fairness.	A document is relevant to the query “media use” when it directly examines how people consume or engage with media (especially digital/social media), or presents methods and measures to capture such behavior. In this paragraph, items like the guide to web tracking for studying digital media use and online behavior, interviews about social media and democracy, misinformation, and visual content analysis, as well as discussions of linking surveys with social media traces and mobile sensing for tracking news or political information use are clearly relevant. Research validating media-related scales (e.g., media-based empathy with subscales like immersion in video games and correlations with media use) also counts as relevant because it measures media-related behavior or dispositions tied to use. By contrast, psychometric instruments on workaholism, attitudes toward asylum seekers, personality adjectives, teacher self-concepts, or technical notes on sampling error are non-relevant unless they explicitly analyze media consumption or usage patterns; API tutorials are only relevant if used to collect behavioral data on media use. Edge cases include fairness or NLP pipeline interviews: they are relevant when linked to how users produce/consume content on platforms, but become peripheral if focused solely on algorithmic properties without discussing user media behavior.
2272	work life balance	The user seeks research-based insights and measurement tools on work–life balance, including how job attitudes, stress, and life events affect well-being and life satisfaction. They likely want validated survey scales and methods to assess these constructs.	A document is relevant to “work life balance” when it explicitly examines how people manage or reconcile work demands with personal, family, or leisure time, including topics like time-based or strain-based conflict, flexible work arrangements, boundary management, burnout, and effects on satisfaction, health, or performance. Research using surveys is relevant if it measures work–nonwork interface directly (e.g., items on work-to-family conflict, caregiving constraints, hours worked vs. off-time recovery) or analyzes determinants and outcomes of balance. The provided paragraph mostly covers survey methods and diverse psychosocial scales (life satisfaction, main status, supervisor relationship, occupational stress, alienation from work) and is only tangentially relevant unless it explicitly links these constructs to balancing work with nonwork roles. Edge cases include false positives where “balance” refers to sample balance in mixed-mode surveys or ethical “balancing” in digital behavioral data; terms like “working life” or general “quality of life” also aren’t sufficient without a work–family nexus. For example, a scale on satisfaction with pay or authoritarian attitudes is not relevant, whereas a measure of work–family time conflict or the impact of flexible scheduling on family time would be.
230	umweltbewusstsein	The user seeks an overview of “environmental awareness” as measured by the SEU scale, including its rational-choice basis, core subscales (intrinsic and instrumental views of nature, nature as life support), and the related attitudes, behavioral intentions, behaviors, and content areas (e.g., transport use, energy/water saving) it assesses.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses Umweltbewusstsein (environmental consciousness) as a belief or worldview, especially when defining or operationalizing it with scales like the SEU/SEU3, referencing subscales such as intrinsic and instrumental nature understanding or “nature as a basis for existence,” and grounding it in frameworks like Rational Choice or the Maloney & Ward Ecology Scale. It is also relevant if it measures related constructs—environmental attitudes, behavioral intentions, or self-reported behaviors—and covers content domains like transport choices, energy or water saving without confounding them with the theoretical constructs. Examples of highly relevant content include descriptions of scale construction, validity, subscale items, or applications of the SEU in surveys. Non-relevant documents would merely mention environmental protection practices or campaigns without discussing environmental consciousness as a construct, or focus on environmental knowledge/policy/CSR without linking to beliefs or measurement. Edge cases include texts using “umweltbewusst” as a casual adjective (likely weak relevance), discussions of “ecological attitude” that map clearly to the SEU domains (potentially relevant), or papers in other languages that operationalize the same constructs under different labels (e.g., “environmental worldview”).
23614	medien nutzung	The user seeks information on research and survey instruments that measure media usage and access (landline, mobile, internet/social media) and related ICT topics like IoT and digital skills, mainly in German/EU contexts. They want details on pretested question design, participant information about web paradata, and links between media use, information flows, and trust.	A document is relevant if it examines the use of media or communication technologies by people, such as access, frequency, and networks for landline, mobile phone, and internet-based services, or behaviors on social media. Pretests or questionnaires that measure Mediennutzung/Kommunikationsmedien usage (e.g., modules on social media in election studies, ICT/IoT use in households or at work) are relevant, even if they focus on measurement design. By contrast, items about unrelated “usage” such as solararium use, smoking-cessation aids, or general methodological pieces on web paradata or survey-trust interventions are non-relevant unless they directly analyze media-use behavior. Edge cases include instruments with a “media” subscale in teacher self-concepts—these are only relevant if they report actual media-use practices rather than attitudes—and ICT/digital skills surveys that qualify only when they explicitly address media/communication use.
2386	politische einstellung	The user is seeking information on survey instruments and validated scales for measuring political attitudes and related socio-political constructs, especially within German and European studies. They want details on topics such as left–right orientation, immigration/asylum, welfare redistribution, climate change, antisemitism, gender equality, political efficacy/cynicism, and the associated pretests and methodologies (e.g., cognitive interviews, web probing) used in studies like CSES, ESS, and ALLBUS.	A document is relevant if it directly measures, analyzes, or reports on political attitudes (politische Einstellung), such as left–right self-placement, views on immigration/asylum, redistribution and income inequality, political cynicism or efficacy, nationalism, or respect for state authority. Highly relevant examples include descriptions of CSES Module 5 or ESS immigration items, the SECS-GER conservatism scale, the KPZ (political cynicism) or PEKS (political efficacy) short scales, and pretests covering attitudes toward elites, national identity, welfare state, climate policy, antisemitism, and gender equality. Method-focused texts (e.g., cognitive interviewing, web probing) are relevant only if they detail the actual attitude items or constructs; purely procedural accounts are weakly relevant. Content on adjacent domains (e.g., ego-centered networks in a COVID study) is non-relevant unless it explicitly links to political trust, compliance, or value orientations; similarly, attitudes toward parental authority are borderline unless tied to political or state authority/patriotism. Irrelevant cases also include uses of “Einstellung” meaning technical settings or hiring, or general political news without identifiable attitudinal constructs or measures.
23986	ungleichheit	The user is seeking research-based information on social inequality—how it is measured and perceived—and its relationship to populist attitudes, especially using German/European surveys and instruments (e.g., ALLBUS, ISSP, EGP class schema) and infographics on income and wealth distribution. They likely want methodological details on scales, pretests, and comparative measurements.	A document is relevant to the query “ungleichheit” when it focuses on social or economic inequality—such as income/wealth distribution, perceived inequality, stratification/class schemas (e.g., EGP), and related measurement instruments or surveys (ALLBUS, ISSP), including methodological work that evaluates how inequality is assessed. The provided paragraph is highly relevant: it centers on perceived social inequalities, links them to populist attitudes, discusses factual information about income and wealth distribution, and details scales (Egalitarianism) and class schemas (EGP) used in comparative research. Documents are non-relevant if they use “Ungleichheit” outside the social-science context (e.g., mathematical inequalities, technical tolerances) or only mention the term without substantive discussion or data. Edge cases include methodology-only pieces (e.g., cognitive pretests) that remain relevant when they test inequality items or graphics, and topics like immigration/antisemitism that are relevant only if explicitly tied to attitudes toward social inequality. Related terms such as Einkommensverteilung, Vermögensungleichheit, soziale Mobilität, Klassen-/Schichtmodelle, and Egalitarismus strengthen relevance, especially when backed by empirical analysis or experiments.
24946	umweltschutz	The user is seeking information on a standardized tool to measure environmental awareness and protection-related behaviors, specifically the SEU scale based on Maloney and Ward’s Ecology Scale, including what constructs it assesses (attitudes, behavioral intentions, self-reported behaviors) and the domains it covers (e.g., transport use, energy/water saving).	A document is relevant if it addresses environmental protection (Umweltschutz) directly or describes tools for assessing it, such as scales that measure environmental consciousness and related behaviors. References to the SEU/SEU3 or the Maloney and Ward Ecology Scale, and coverage of constructs like environmental attitudes, behavioral intentions, and self-reported behaviors—especially across domains like transport use, energy saving, or water conservation—strongly indicate relevance. Content that merely discusses psychological scales unrelated to the environment, uses “Schutz” in a different sense (e.g., data protection), or treats “environment” abstractly without linking to protective actions or measurable behaviors would be non-relevant. Edge cases include methodological papers about self-report bias or construct confounding; these are relevant if they pertain to measuring environmental behaviors or attitudes tied to Umweltschutz. Likewise, domain-specific discussions (e.g., energy-saving practices) remain relevant when framed as contributions to environmental protection rather than purely technical efficiency.
2500	violence	The user seeks information on questionnaires and psychometric scales related to youth violence and associated attitudes—covering violent behaviors, pro-violence norms, Machiavellianism, authoritarianism, and law-and-order positions—as well as a teacher self-efficacy scale for handling bullying, especially those developed in Bielefeld University’s Youth and Violence projects.	A document is relevant to the query “violence” when it directly discusses violent behavior, attitudes that endorse or normalize physical violence, or tools that measure violence (e.g., scales for violence against persons or objects, or teacher self-efficacy for handling bullying/mobbing). Content describing research projects centered on youth and violence, the development and validation of violence-related questionnaires, or classifications of violent settings is also clearly relevant. Material that only mentions adjacent constructs (e.g., Machiavellianism, authoritarianism, or law-and-order orientations) is relevant only if it explicitly links those traits to the occurrence, endorsement, or management of violence; otherwise, such sections may be marginal. Edge cases include discussions of “mobbing” or school bullying, which typically count as forms of interpersonal violence and are therefore pertinent, and psychometric details (item ranges, reliability) that are relevant insofar as they pertain to violence-measurement tools. Non-relevant content would be metaphorical uses of “violence” (e.g., “violent storms”) or brief, unrelated mentions without substantive treatment of violent behavior or its assessment.
2662	politische orientierung	The user is seeking documentation and validated survey instruments for measuring political orientation (e.g., left–right self-placement) and related socio-political attitudes in German/European studies, along with pretest methods. This includes scales on efficacy, cynicism, redistribution, immigration/asylum, climate change, antisemitism, gender equality, and conservatism from projects like PAWCER, FGZ/ZHP, CSES Module 5, AUTNES, and FReDA.	A document is relevant if it directly defines or measures political orientation (e.g., a Left–Right scale, redistribution/inequality items, or instruments like SECS GER for social/economic conservatism) or reports survey modules/panels that record respondents’ political orientations and related attitudes (e.g., CSES Module 5, the FGZ Zusammenhaltspanel, PAWCER pretests on Left–Right and redistribution). Materials on adjacent political dispositions such as political efficacy (PEKS) or political cynicism (KPZ), or issue attitudes commonly used to infer ideology (e.g., asylum policy items, immigration, climate change) are also relevant when they are tied to locating respondents on a political spectrum. By contrast, instruments about non-political “orientations” (e.g., collective orientation in teams, causal orientation from self-determination theory, religious or family-climate scales), managerial practice surveys, or general online-survey documentation are non-relevant. Edge cases include value-orientation batteries (e.g., “ökologisch-alternative” or “konservativer Konformismus”) that may count if explicitly linked to ideological placement, and studies of political participation (e.g., DDR participation) that are only relevant if they assess orientation rather than behavior alone. Mentions of “sexuelle Orientierung” are false positives for this query.
2741	sport	The user is seeking information on a psychological measurement tool related to sport, specifically a scale that assesses adolescents’ body experience and perceived sporting competence, including its subscales and related constructs.	This paragraph is only tangentially relevant to the query “sport” because its primary focus is a 73‑item psychometric scale about adolescents’ body experience, not sports activities, events, or rules. It does, however, include a subscale on “perceived sporting competence” and related constructs like physical self-presentation, which can matter in sports psychology or sport science contexts. If the user’s intent is to find measures of sport competence or research on how adolescents perceive their athletic abilities, this document is relevant; for general sports news, training programs, or information about specific sports, it is not. An edge case is keyword matching where “sporting” triggers inclusion despite the document offering no practical guidance on sport participation, teams, or performance metrics.
28540	worklife balance	The user is seeking information on how to achieve a healthy balance between work and personal life, including definitions, benefits, and practical strategies (e.g., time management, boundaries, flexible work policies) to reduce stress and improve well-being.	A document is relevant to the query “worklife balance” if it discusses the interplay between work and personal life, such as policies (flexible hours, parental leave), strategies (boundary-setting, remote-work practices), outcomes (stress, burnout, satisfaction), or empirical findings linking work arrangements to well-being and family responsibilities. The provided paragraph is non-relevant because it focuses on survey methodology (mixed-mode surveys), ethical issues in digital behavioral data, and an authoritarian attitudes scale; its use of “balance” (e.g., “sample balance”) is methodological, not about balancing work and life. Examples of relevant content include studies on flexible scheduling reducing burnout, guides for managers on preventing after-hours email overload, or statistics on overtime’s impact on family time. Edge cases: a methods paper could be relevant only if it applies those methods to measure work–life balance specifically; documents that mention “work” and “life” separately or discuss unrelated constructs (e.g., right-wing authoritarianism) without connecting them to work–life outcomes are not.
2911	happiness	The user is looking for validated ways to measure happiness and subjective well-being, including multi-item survey scales and the Human Flourishing Scale (Flourish Index and Secure Flourish Index) and the domains they assess.	A document is relevant if it explicitly examines happiness as a construct—its definition, determinants, or measurement—such as describing survey items, scales, or indices that assess happiness and life satisfaction. Methodological discussions about measuring happiness (e.g., translation and validation of scales, subdomains that include happiness and life satisfaction) are also relevant, as in descriptions of the ISSP three-item happiness scale or the Flourish Index and Secure Flourish Index. Broader well-being or flourishing papers are relevant when they clearly include happiness as a dimension or report results for happiness-related subscales. Non-relevant items include texts that only use “happiness” as a passing phrase, brand name, or metaphor without analyzing the concept, or pieces focused solely on other domains (e.g., financial stability) without connecting them to happiness. Edge cases include documents on family or job satisfaction that serve as proxies for happiness (potentially relevant if the linkage is explicit) and measurement papers on “well-being” that omit a happiness component (likely not relevant).
29207	zufriedenheit ausbildung	The user is looking for validated questionnaires to assess satisfaction with training/education—especially in firefighter and rescue service programs—including dimensions such as instructor behavior, structure, group dynamics, and learning outcomes, along with their psychometric evidence.	A document is relevant if it addresses satisfaction within a training or educational context, such as instruments that evaluate trainees’ satisfaction with coursework, instructors, exercises, or the overall quality of an Ausbildung/Lehrgang. For example, the FIRE instruments for the training of rescue forces (including modules on plan exercises, deployment exercises, group work, instructor competence, and self-directed tasks) are highly relevant because they explicitly assess perceived training quality, learning processes, competence acquisition, and transfer, and report psychometric validity and reliability. By contrast, scales on life satisfaction (SWLS), residential satisfaction, satisfaction with a doctor visit, parental child-rearing dimensions, or national identification mention “Zufriedenheit” but are not about training, so they are non-relevant. Borderline cases include general job satisfaction or stress/burden and climate measures, which would only be relevant if applied specifically to trainees or apprenticeship settings. Also beware of false positives where “Ausbildung” refers to the formation of attitudes (e.g., nationalist value formation) rather than vocational or professional training.
29262	zufriedenheit arbeit	The user seeks information on job satisfaction—what it is, what influences it, and how to measure it—ideally using validated German survey instruments and scales. They may also be interested in related constructs like workplace stress, pay satisfaction, and organizational climate.	A document is relevant if it directly addresses Arbeitszufriedenheit (job/work satisfaction) or closely related constructs in the workplace, such as satisfaction with pay, company evaluation, work climate, decision latitude, task variety, and psychological job demands. Examples include descriptions or validations of job satisfaction instruments, discussions of dimensions like self-fulfillment vs. resignation, or surveys like ALLBUS scales on importance of work attributes that explain determinants of job satisfaction. Content that focuses on other domains of satisfaction—e.g., Lebenszufriedenheit (SWLS), Wohnzufriedenheit (neighborhood/traffic safety/air quality), or satisfaction with a doctor visit—is non-relevant unless it explicitly links back to satisfaction with one’s work. Edge cases: measures of perceived job characteristics (e.g., decision-making scope, job demands) or Arbeitsorientierung can be relevant if tied to explaining or predicting work satisfaction, while general personality traits (procrastination, sensation seeking, health anxiety, social desirability) are not relevant unless analyzed as predictors of Arbeitszufriedenheit. Documents merely listing unrelated psychosocial scales without a clear work-satisfaction component should be considered non-relevant.
29421	zufriedenheit	The user seeks an overview of German-language instruments for measuring satisfaction across domains (life, work, neighborhood, doctor visits), including the SWLS. They want what each scale assesses along with key dimensions, development/pretesting, and psychometric properties.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses “Zufriedenheit” (satisfaction) as a construct or outcome, especially in domains like life satisfaction, job satisfaction, residential/neighborhood satisfaction, or patient satisfaction. Strong signals include use of established instruments and items (e.g., the SWLS five‑item life satisfaction scale; a 37‑item work satisfaction measure covering self‑actualization, resignation, pay satisfaction, and company appraisal) and psychometric details such as Rasch scalability or high reliability coefficients. Content that ties contextual criteria (child-friendliness, air quality, traffic safety) to positive/negative satisfaction judgments, or describes cognitive pretests of satisfaction questionnaires, also matches the query. Non-relevant documents merely mentioning related factors (traffic, workplace stress) without framing them in terms of satisfaction, or using “zufrieden/Unzufriedenheit” as a brand name or throwaway term, should be excluded. Edge cases include proxies like Lebensqualität (quality of life) being relevant when explicitly linked to satisfaction, and negated forms (Unzufriedenheit) which still fit if the focus is on (un)satisfaction.
2945	life satisfaction	Find validated ways to define and measure life satisfaction (subjective well-being), including global and domain-specific scales like the SWLS and single-item L-1. The user likely wants brief details on items, translations, psychometric properties, and suitability for surveys and various research contexts.	A document is relevant if it defines, measures, or analyzes global life satisfaction as a construct, including its cognitive and affective components (e.g., Diener’s framework) and presents instruments or items that directly assess overall satisfaction with life. Examples of clearly relevant content include the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), the single-item General Life Satisfaction L-1, and translations/adaptations with psychometric evidence (reliability, validity, measurement invariance). Documents focused on domain-specific satisfaction (job, study, political system, neighborhood) are generally non-relevant unless they explicitly aggregate into a global life satisfaction score or examine direct links to overall life satisfaction. Edge cases include broader well-being or flourishing batteries where life satisfaction is a core subdomain (likely relevant), and instruments where life satisfaction appears only as a validation correlate (e.g., optimism SOP2 or cross-cultural loss scales), which are marginally relevant only if they report substantive associations with life satisfaction. Mentions of quality of life or life events are relevant when they directly measure or interpret life satisfaction outcomes, whereas unrelated constructs like customer satisfaction or teacher stress without a life satisfaction link are non-relevant.
30368	work	The user is seeking social science resources on “work,” particularly validated measurement scales (e.g., alienation, work–family conflict, vocational values, group work, employee thriving) and related datasets/tools to support research and data collection.	A document is relevant to the query “work” when it focuses on employment, the workplace, or job-related constructs, such as attitudes toward work, work–family conflict, or measures of thriving at work. In this paragraph, items like “alienation from work,” “work–family conflict,” “work as a means of securing one’s livelihood,” the GRowing Work Inventory, and the evaluation of group work directly address work-related phenomena and are clearly relevant. By contrast, occurrences where “work” is used in the sense of “the works of [author],” “works for SPSS and Stata,” or “working with YouTube APIs” refer to publications, software compatibility, or technical usage and are not relevant to employment or the workplace; the YouTube Data API guide is largely irrelevant aside from incidental wording. Edge cases include constructs like “evaluation of the company” and “group work,” which remain work-relevant, whereas scales on ecological responsibility, procrastination, or sensation seeking are only tangential unless explicitly tied to workplace behavior. Overall, relevance is high for sections centered on work attitudes and experiences, and low for tool guides and general psychological scales not anchored in a work context.
31054	schule	The user is seeking an overview of validated measurement instruments and survey standards used in German school and education research—covering teacher-related constructs (job satisfaction, perceived suitability, stress), classroom climate, bullying self-efficacy, digital learning readiness, and growth mindset, as well as sociodemographic items including for migrants. They also want references to major studies and pretests (e.g., PIAAC, COVID-19-related child future anxiety scales) and evidence of psychometric quality.	The German keyword “schule” targets content about schools, pupils, teachers, classrooms, and educational credentials, so documents describing classroom climate, teacher-student interactions, bullying among pupils, or measures of school attainment (e.g., Schulabschluss) are relevant. This paragraph is highly relevant because it discusses teachers’ self-efficacy regarding bullying, classroom climate dimensions, primary school interventions, and survey items capturing school and training degrees, as well as digital readiness for teaching and learning in schools. A document would be non-relevant if “Schule” appears only as a substring in unrelated contexts (e.g., Frankfurter Schule as a philosophical school, Fahrschule/driving school, a surname) or solely within “Hochschule” when the intent is K‑12 schooling. Edge cases include higher-education contexts like Hochschule or teacher training that still refer to school classrooms—these may be partially relevant—and survey methodology pieces that mainly treat demographics but contain substantive sections on school qualifications. Matching should consider capitalization and variants such as Schule, Schulen, schul-, Schüler, Schulabschluss, and Grundschule.
3107	drugs	The user is seeking information on how drug offenses are defined and measured within the adolescent self-reported delinquency scale, specifically how they are represented among the 16 items assessing dissocial behavior.	For the query "drugs," a document is relevant if it discusses drugs in any substantive way—illicit substances, medications, drug use/abuse, policy, trafficking, testing, or drug-related crimes. This paragraph is relevant because it explicitly mentions “drug offences” as part of an adolescent delinquency scale, though drugs are a secondary facet among broader crime categories, making the relevance partial. Documents that focus on drug use, specific substances, health effects, treatment, prevention, or legal frameworks around drugs would be more strongly relevant, whereas content limited to theft, property damage, or violent crimes without any drug reference would be non-relevant. An edge case is lexical variation: the query “drugs” might not exactly match “drug offences” without stemming, yet the topic is still aligned; by contrast, incidental mentions (e.g., in a bibliography) or purely metaphorical uses would not be relevant. Another nuance is intent—both medical and criminal-justice contexts can satisfy “drugs,” but if the user seeks pharmacological information specifically, a delinquency scale mentioning drug offences would be only tangentially useful.
3125	arbeitslosigkeit	The user seeks information about unemployment, particularly in the context of consumer ethnocentrism and the belief that buying foreign products harms the domestic economy and leads to job losses.	A document is relevant to the query “arbeitslosigkeit” if it directly addresses unemployment—its definition, causes, consequences, rates (e.g., Arbeitslosenquote), policies, or related supports like benefits and insurance—and if it uses the term or close variants such as Erwerbslosigkeit, Langzeitarbeitslosigkeit, Jugendarbeitslosigkeit, or Jobverlust. Content that links other topics to unemployment, for example arguing that certain consumer behaviors can “cause unemployment,” can also be relevant, though it may be only marginally so if unemployment is mentioned in passing while the main focus (e.g., a psychometric scale for consumer ethnocentrism) lies elsewhere. Strong signals include statistics, labor market analysis, discussions of the Bundesagentur für Arbeit data, or policy debates about reducing unemployment. Non-relevant items are those that discuss ethnocentrism or consumption without any tie to unemployment, use “arbeitslosigkeit” metaphorically, or focus solely on unrelated labor concepts; pieces about Arbeitslosengeld or Arbeitslosenversicherung are relevant only if they connect back to the state or dynamics of unemployment. Edge cases include documents where unemployment appears in a single section of a broader topic, German compound forms that embed the term, case variations, or multilingual texts where the German term is briefly cited but the substantive discussion occurs under another language’s term for unemployment.
3147	antisemitismus	The user is seeking information on how antisemitism is measured in German social surveys, specifically the development and cognitive pretesting of antisemitism-related questionnaire items in the FGZ Cohesion Panel (wave 2) and ALLBUS 2006.	A document is relevant to the query “antisemitismus” if it substantively addresses antisemitism—e.g., defines the concept, reports attitudes or incidents, presents survey items or scales about antisemitism, or describes methods for testing such questions. The provided paragraph is relevant because it details pretests and cognitive evaluation of survey questions on antisemitism in the FGZ cohesion panel and the ALLBUS 2006 study, including methodologies like web probing and cognitive interviews. A document would be non-relevant if it only mentions antisemitism in passing within a topic list (e.g., alongside climate change or gender equality) but provides no further information, results, or instrumentation related to antisemitism. Edge cases that should still count as relevant include methodology-only papers validating antisemitism items, datasets whose variables cover antisemitism, or German/English variants of the term (“Antisemitismus”/“antisemitism”). Borderline cases include general prejudice studies that list a single antisemitism indicator without detail, or historical discussions of anti-Judaism that never engage the modern antisemitism construct.
3148	health	The user seeks resources on studying health and mental well-being using digital behavioral data and online survey methods. They need guidance on web tracking and social media recruitment, validated health and well-being scales (e.g., SF-12, self-efficacy, flourishing, workaholism), and ethical and cross-language considerations for vulnerable populations.	A document is relevant to the query “health” when it directly discusses physical or mental health outcomes, measurement instruments, analytics, health-related populations, or healthcare practice and ethics. In this passage, content on digital behavioral data for health analytics, the SF-12 physical/mental health survey, occupational health psychology (e.g., workaholism impacts), and the Human Flourishing Scale’s health domains are clearly relevant, as are interviews on digital epidemiology and studying vulnerable communities online. Method guides (web tracking, recruiting via Facebook/Instagram) are relevant when they are applied to health topics such as health information seeking or sampling health workers; if they describe methods without a health use case, they are only tangentially relevant. Edge cases include general variables like age or self-efficacy, which are relevant when explicitly linked to health analyses but not when presented in isolation or in non-health contexts; likewise, uses of “health” as a metaphor (e.g., “system health”) would be non-relevant. Overall, this paragraph is strongly relevant because it repeatedly centers on health measurement, mental health, and ethical issues in health data.
31794	safety	The user is seeking information on safety as a measurable construct, especially psychological safety in teams and perceived safety in residential areas. They want validated survey instruments (e.g., PsySafety Check, HPTS), their versions, and evidence of reliability, validity, and links to outcomes like team performance and quality of life.	Highly relevant documents will focus on psychological safety in teams—e.g., studies validating instruments like the PsySafety Check (PS C) or the High Performance Team Survey (HPTS), reporting psychometric evidence (convergent/divergent validity, criterion validity) and links to outcomes such as team learning, belonging, and performance, including references like Google’s Project Aristotle. Papers that treat “safety” as part of quality-of-life assessments (for example, neighborhood traffic safety or child-friendliness) can be partially relevant if safety is analyzed as a core dimension, but are secondary to team-based psychological safety. Non-relevant items include content on unrelated domains such as product or food safety, cybersecurity, occupational accident protocols, or sports uses of “safety,” which do not address interpersonal risk-taking or team climate. Edge cases include documents that list safety as one among many factors without analysis or measurement detail (marginal relevance) or essays on “safe spaces” without empirical constructs or validated scales (less relevant unless tied to measurement and outcomes).
32087	sexualität	Seeks a way to assess how informed individuals are about sexuality, relationships, pregnancy, and contraceptive methods, likely via a structured questionnaire.	A document is relevant if it substantively discusses sexuality—such as sexual education, sexual health, contraception, relationships, or pregnancy—and uses terms like Sexualität, Verhütung, Partnerschaft, or Schwangerschaft with explanatory content. Materials that present tools or assessments (e.g., a questionnaire measuring knowledge about sexuality and contraceptive methods) are strongly relevant because they directly address understanding of sexuality. Documents are less relevant if they only mention the word “Sexualität” in passing, in navigation menus, tag lists, or bibliographies without meaningful discussion. Edge cases include texts about animal reproduction or legal discussions of sexual offenses, which match the keyword but may miss a user’s likely intent for human sexual health or education; they can be considered weakly relevant. Language alignment also matters: German-language content matching the query term “Sexualität” is more likely to be relevant than unrelated content in other languages or about gender (“Geschlecht”) without sexual context.
32407	sexual	The user seeks information on social-science approaches to studying sexuality, including questionnaires that assess sexual behavior and contraception knowledge and the “overemphasis on the sexual” facet in authoritarianism scales. They also want insights into leveraging digital behavioral data to research sensitive sexual topics in vulnerable communities, along with the ethical and methodological challenges involved.	A document is relevant to the query “sexual” when it substantively discusses sexual topics or uses the term in context, such as sexual behavior, sexuality, partnership, pregnancy, or contraceptive methods. The provided paragraph is relevant because it mentions a questionnaire on sexual behavior, measures knowledge about sexuality and contraception, references “overemphasis on the sexual” within an authoritarianism scale, and discusses research on sensitive topics including sexualities. It would be non-relevant if “sexual” appeared only incidentally (e.g., in a citation, author bio, or as part of a term like “asexual reproduction” unrelated to human sexuality) or if the main emphasis were entirely unrelated. Edge cases include morphological variants (sexual, sexuality, sexualities) and contexts focusing on methodology or ethics of studying online communications about sexual topics; these remain relevant if they engage the concept meaningfully. Conversely, documents about vulnerable communities that never address sexual issues, or that use “sexual” metaphorically without substantive content, should be treated as non-relevant.
3247	political orientation	The user wants an overview of how political orientation and related socio‑political attitudes are conceptualized and measured. Specifically, they seek validated survey instruments (e.g., left–right self-placement, political efficacy, participation, cynicism) with their factors/subscales and evidence on reliability, validity, and cross-national comparability.	A document is relevant if it defines, classifies, or measures political orientation (e.g., ideological self-placement such as left–right, conservative–liberal, or constructs like “politically tolerant orientation” and “conservative conformism”). This passage is relevant because it includes the Left–Right Self-Placement scale and multiple validated instruments tied to political attitudes and behavior (e.g., political cynicism, political efficacy PEKS/PESS, perceived political self-efficacy P-PSE, and various forms of political participation) that are commonly used to operationalize or correlate with political orientation in surveys. Content on political efficacy and participation is adjacent rather than definitional, but it often serves as an empirical proxy or correlate for orientation and so contributes useful context. By contrast, sections on managerial “task/relation/change/external orientation,” collective orientation in teams, acculturation orientation, and gender role orientations are non-relevant unless explicitly linked to ideological positioning. Edge cases include national pride (political vs cultural pride) and religiosity, which can indicate political orientation indirectly; they are relevant if used to locate individuals on an ideological spectrum, but otherwise may be tangential.
32738	sicherheit	The user is seeking information on “Sicherheit” in the sense of psychological safety in teams—its definition, importance for learning and performance, and validated measurement tools (e.g., PsySafety Check, HPTS). They may also want how notions of security/safety feature in related constructs like authoritarian attitudes and ambivalent sexism.	This document is relevant to the query “sicherheit” insofar as it focuses on psychological safety in teams, repeatedly using the term in contexts like “psychologische Sicherheit,” feelings of safety in relationships, and seeking safety in authority, and it describes validated instruments (PsySafety Check, HPTS) that measure this construct. It will be highly relevant for users interested in team climate, organizational behavior, or psychometrics (e.g., how psychological safety predicts learning and performance), and partially relevant for sociological takes on security-seeking tendencies. It is not relevant if the intent is cybersecurity/IT-Sicherheit, physical or occupational safety regulations, public/national security, or technical risk mitigation, since none of those are covered. Edge cases: keyword matching will still hit on “Sicherheit” within phrases like “psychologische Sicherheit” or in scales about sexism and authoritarianism, which may produce false positives for users expecting technical security; conversely, related terms like “Geborgenheit” and “Schutz” appear alongside “Sicherheit” and may aid recall if semantic expansion is used.
32820	selbstdarstellung	The user is seeking information on self-presentation in psychology, particularly a German self-monitoring measure that assesses sensitivity to others’ expressive behavior and the ability to modify one’s self-presentation (the German version of the Lennox & Wolfe, 1984 scale).	A document is relevant if it discusses “Selbstdarstellung” specifically in the psychological sense of self-presentation as operationalized by the German adaptation of the Lennox & Wolfe (1984) Self-Monitoring Scale, especially mentioning its subscales like sensitivity to others’ expressive behavior and the ability to modify one’s self-presentation. Content that describes, validates, translates, or applies this German questionnaire (e.g., psychometric properties, sample items) or ties self-presentation to self-monitoring in interpersonal communication also counts as relevant. Partially relevant items include broader work on self-presentation/self-monitoring (e.g., Snyder’s Self-Monitoring Scale, impression management, Goffman’s presentation of self) or texts using close terms like “Selbstpräsentation” or the English “self-presentation,” even if not the exact German Lennox & Wolfe scale. Non-relevant are uses of “Selbstdarstellung” in non-psychological contexts—artistic self-portraits, political PR/branding, corporate image crafting, or website bios—where no psychological measurement or modification-of-self-presentation construct is involved. Edge cases include papers that merely cite the scale without describing it, or “self monitoring” in health/tech systems; these are low relevance unless they explicitly assess the two stated subscales.
3294	haushaltseinkommen	The user seeks guidance on how household income is measured in social surveys, including standardized (and shorter) sociodemographic items. They also want methods and tools to derive poverty indicators from categorized household income data, such as in the German Mikrozensus.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses household income (Haushaltseinkommen) or closely related constructs, such as survey items capturing household income, methods for classed income in the Mikrozensus, or tools for deriving poverty measures from household income (e.g., syntax to compute household-specific poverty probabilities). For example, reports describing pretests of standard questions that include household income or methodological papers discussing biases from using class midpoints in income classes are clearly relevant. Content focused only on other topics in the same studies (e.g., religion or COVID-19) without substantive discussion of income, or discussing individual earnings without linking to household-level measures, would be non-relevant. Edge cases include documents mentioning household composition or education that are relevant only if tied to the construction or equivalization of household income, and texts using synonyms like “equivalized household income” or “income classes of the household,” which should still count as relevant.
3297	schulische bildung	The user seeks an overview of how school education (educational attainment) is conceptualized, measured, and coded in national and international surveys—distinguishing it from competencies and ensuring cross-country comparability (e.g., ISCED, CASMIN). They also want examples from German research on youth self-efficacy and educational aspirations (e.g., RISS, GIP), plus approaches for measuring education among migrants.	A document is relevant if it addresses school-based education (schulische Bildung) such as students’ experiences, decisions, or outcomes within primary/secondary schooling—for example, studies of adolescents’ self-efficacy in the school context, parental vs. realistic educational aspirations, or the use of ISCED/CASMIN to classify school attainment across countries. Methodological pieces on how “education” is conceptualized, measured, and coded in surveys are relevant when they explicitly pertain to schooling levels or to comparing school qualifications (including approaches for migrants whose credentials must be mapped to German school categories). Content focused mainly on non-school settings—adult/continuing education, generic political attitudes or reform preferences without a schooling angle, higher education only, or psychological scales applied outside school (e.g., a curiosity inventory with no school framing)—is less relevant. Edge cases include papers using “Bildung” broadly: they are relevant if they link attitudes or indicators to school-level qualifications or decisions, but not if they focus on competencies, grades, or vocational training detached from the schulische setting. For example, an analysis of ISCED 1997 implementation for census schooling data is relevant, whereas a reforms monitor about taxes or pensions is not unless it specifically examines school reforms.
32984	security	The user is looking for how “security” is defined and measured in social/psychological surveys, including as a value, a sense of safety/stability, and financial/material security. They want examples of relevant scales or items (e.g., Human Values Scale, Authoritarian Attitudes, Secure Flourish Index) that capture this construct.	For the query “security,” a document is relevant if it substantively addresses security as a condition or value—e.g., personal safety, psychological protection, institutional protection, or financial/material stability—rather than only naming the word. This paragraph is relevant because it discusses security across multiple social-science scales: security as a feeling within ambivalent sexism, retreat to protective authorities in authoritarian attitudes, “security” as a core value in the Human Values Scale, and financial/material security in the Secure Flourish Index. It would be less relevant if “security” appeared only incidentally (e.g., a passing adjective) or referred to unrelated homonyms like financial “securities.” Edge cases include user intent: if the user seeks cybersecurity or national security, this document is only tangentially relevant; if they seek psychological, social, or well-being dimensions of security, it is highly relevant.
3307	political participation	The user is looking for how political participation is defined and categorized (e.g., formal vs. informal) and how it is measured, including validated scales and predictors like internal/external political efficacy and partisan identity. They also want information on research methods (surveys, web tracking) and evidence on the validity and cross-cultural applicability of these measures.	A document is relevant if it defines, categorizes, measures, or explains political participation—for example, discussions of formal vs. informal or demonstrative vs. passive participation, and validated instruments that assess participation or its drivers. Studies that validate constructs closely tied to participation and show predictive links (e.g., Perceived Political Self-Efficacy/P-PSE, the Political Efficacy Short Scale, or partisan identity scales used to predict turnout and engagement) are clearly on-topic, as are method pieces that apply web tracking to analyze online political participation. Content on adjacent attitudes (political cynicism, satisfaction with the political system, left–right placement, conservatism, or political pride) is only relevant if it explicitly connects those attitudes to participation behavior or propensity. Materials about survey logistics (e.g., postal survey recruitment), epistemology debates, rescue training exam feedback, or asylum-attitude measurements are non-relevant unless they directly assess or influence political participation. Edge cases include uses of “participation” that mean survey or training participation (not political), and social media discussions that matter only when they address how platforms shape political engagement.
33259	selbstwirksamkeit	The user is seeking an overview of self-efficacy (distinguishing general vs domain-specific) and validated German measures of it, such as the SESW for study entry and team process/collective self-efficacy instruments. They likely want psychometric evidence (reliability/validity) and applications in educational and political contexts.	A document is relevant to the query “selbstwirksamkeit” if it explicitly defines or discusses self-efficacy (e.g., citing Bandura 1977 or distinguishing general vs. domain-specific self-efficacy) or presents/validates measures of it, such as scales for student entry self-efficacy (SESW) or efficacy beliefs in education and politics, with psychometric details like Cronbach’s alpha or omega. Content that applies self-efficacy in concrete contexts—school transitions, political participation, or teams (including collective self-efficacy)—is also relevant, especially when it links the construct to outcomes or provides validated questionnaires. Documents are only weakly relevant if self-efficacy is mentioned tangentially (e.g., a team-process instrument that merely lists collective self-efficacy as a correlate without defining or measuring it). Non-relevant items include uses of “Wirksamkeit” meaning intervention/drug effectiveness rather than beliefs about one’s capability, or pieces that report procedural details (e.g., interview methods) without substantive self-efficacy content. Edge cases include synonyms and abbreviations (self-efficacy, efficacy beliefs, Wirksamkeitsüberzeugungen, SESW) and articles where self-efficacy appears only in references or footnotes rather than the main analysis.
33371	selbstverwirklichung	The user seeks an explanation of “self-actualization” as a dimension of general job satisfaction—how personal fulfillment at work is assessed within a 37-item instrument alongside resignation, pay satisfaction, and company evaluation.	A document is relevant if it defines, discusses, or operationalizes Selbstverwirklichung (self-actualization/self-fulfillment), especially in work or psychology, for example by presenting items or scales that measure autonomy, creativity, meaning, or personal growth. Content like a job-satisfaction instrument that includes Selbstverwirklichung as one of several dimensions (alongside resignation, pay satisfaction, or company evaluation) is relevant because it provides a concrete framework for assessing the concept. Discussions of Maslow’s hierarchy, workplace enrichment, or German/English terminology equivalents (e.g., self-actualization, Selbstverwirklichungsbedürfnis) also count. Non-relevant documents focus solely on other facets (e.g., pay or general company assessment) without substantive treatment of Selbstverwirklichung, or only name-drop the term without definition, examples, or metrics. Edge cases include confusion with related but distinct terms like Selbstwirksamkeit (self-efficacy) or Selbstbestimmung (self-determination), hyphenation/line-break variants (Selbst­verwirklichung), and brand or poetic uses that don’t address the psychological construct.
3340	sex	The user is looking for how “sex” is defined and collected in German surveys, distinguishing biological sex from gender identity, and how this affects the identification and estimation of cohabiting unions (different-sex vs same-sex) in microcensus data. They also seek the related role of age, marital status, and cohabitation measures in survey analysis.	A document is relevant if it uses “sex” as a socio-demographic variable (e.g., male/female/“diverse”) or classifies partnerships as same-sex vs different-sex, especially in survey, census, or statistical methodology contexts. Content that discusses how sex is recorded (biological sex vs sex according to civil registry), contrasts sex with gender identity, or explains procedures for identifying/co-estimating same-sex and different-sex cohabiting unions (such as in the German microcensus) is directly on-topic. By contrast, material where “sex” means sexual activity, sex education, or general discussions of age, marital status, or cohabitation without linking to sex categories would be non-relevant. Edge cases include documents that say “gender” but explicitly map it to biological/civil-status sex, mention third options like “diverse,” or use synonyms like “sex assigned at birth” (likely relevant), whereas incidental mentions of “same-sex” without any treatment of sex measurement or categorization may be borderline.
33461	rechts links	The user seeks information on measuring political orientation using a Left–Right scale in social surveys, including validated/pretested items and related measures of attitudes toward income inequality/redistribution and authoritarianism (e.g., B‑RWA‑6) used in German/European studies. They may also want guidance on standardized items for citizenship/work-permit variables and methodological approaches to poverty measurement with the German Microcensus.	A document is relevant if it deals with the left–right political spectrum or its measurement, for example mentioning a Links–Rechts Skala, self-placement on a left/right scale, or related constructs like right-wing authoritarianism; this paragraph qualifies because it explicitly references a Links Rechts Skala and rechtsgerichtete autoritäre Einstellungen. It is also relevant when discussing attitudes (e.g., toward income redistribution) explicitly framed by left–right orientation. By contrast, texts that use Rechte to mean citizenship or legal rights, or use rechts as a physical direction or links as “hyperlinks,” are non-relevant even if the words appear. Edge cases include hyphenation and variants such as Links-Rechts, links/rechts, LR scale, English “left–right,” and compounds like rechtsgerichtet, which can be relevant if tied to political ideology; discussions of poverty measurement or survey methodology are only relevant if they anchor findings to left–right positioning.
3420	left right	The user likely wants information on the Left–Right political self-placement scale, explaining how it measures ideological orientation and how it is used in social and political surveys (e.g., Germany’s ALLBUS).	A document is relevant when it uses “left right” to denote the political ideology spectrum or measurement instruments that place individuals along that axis (e.g., the Left Right Self Placement scale, Right-Wing Authoritarianism measures, B-RWA). This passage is relevant because it explicitly names the Left Right Self Placement scale and discusses right-wing authoritarianism and related attitudinal scales that map onto the left–right dimension. Mentions of “right” as civil or legal rights (right to vote, freedom to travel) or “left” as a verb (“left blank”) are non-relevant uses despite matching the keywords. Edge cases include hyphenated or abbreviated forms (left-right, L–R) and synonyms like liberal–conservative; texts focusing only on “right-wing” can still be relevant if they anchor it on the left–right spectrum. Conversely, content about digital behavioral data ethics is non-relevant unless it explicitly links to political left–right positioning.
3474	arbeitszeit	The user is seeking information on how working time (Arbeitszeit) is captured across several German social surveys and pretests (ISSP 2015, BIBB/BAuA 2011–2012, wb-Personalmonitor 2014, a study on women in agriculture, and FReDA W4), including related topics like work-life balance, employment form, and parental employment. They want details on the survey questions/modules and pretest methods used to measure these concepts.	A document is relevant to the query “arbeitszeit” if it directly addresses working time—such as weekly hours, desired or actual hours, overtime, shift schedules, part‑time/full‑time status, or work–life balance—and clearly ties these to employment or family contexts. Survey descriptions and pretests that explicitly include questions on Arbeitszeit (e.g., desired weekly working time, employer attachment, or women’s working hours on farms) are relevant even if much of the text focuses on methodology like cognitive interviews. Documents are only marginally relevant if “Arbeitszeit” appears in a long list of topics without substantive discussion, or if it’s mentioned solely in metadata, footnotes, or project titles. Non‑relevant cases include texts about unrelated themes (e.g., agricultural policy or demographics) that never discuss work hours, or pieces where “Arbeitszeit” is present only as a homonym or in an unrelated compound. Edge cases include documents using synonyms or other languages (e.g., “working time,” “hours worked”), numeric hours without the keyword, or legal references to Arbeitszeit that don’t provide content beyond a citation.
36787	sustainability	The user seeks research-based ways to measure and study sustainability-related constructs (e.g., beliefs about math for sustainable development, modeling self-efficacy, temporal focus including the distant future, and flourishing) and expert guidance on collecting such data via mobile applications. They are likely looking for validated scales and stable, accessible tools (such as GESIS AppKit) for mobile data collection in social science.	A document is relevant to the query “sustainability” when it directly addresses sustainable development concepts, metrics, or practices, such as frameworks for measuring sustainability beliefs or modeling sustainability-related scenarios. This paragraph is partially relevant because it includes scales tied to sustainable development (e.g., beliefs about mathematics for sustainability and projects modeling speed limits, heat pumps, and electric cars) and introduces a “distant future” temporal focus explicitly positioned as relevant to sustainability research. However, large portions focus on mobile data collection infrastructure and an interview about app-based research methods, which are only tangential unless clearly linked to sustainability outcomes. Mentions of “sustainable” as in “stable, sustainable software” or the “Secure Flourish Index” using “sustain” to mean maintaining well-being are edge cases that match the keyword but do not reflect the sustainability domain. Documents that only use “sustain” in a durability or generic sense would be non-relevant, while those operationalizing sustainability constructs (e.g., validated scales for sustainable development beliefs or distant-future orientation) should rank higher.
37090	stress arbeit	The user is seeking an overview of validated (mostly German-language) psychometric instruments to assess work-related stress/irritation and related psychosocial constructs (e.g., curiosity, responsibility attributions, procrastination, sensation seeking, job characteristics, personal norms, health anxiety, mood, aggression, and job satisfaction). They want brief descriptions, theoretical bases, and psychometric evidence to select appropriate measures for research or assessment.	A document is relevant if it addresses stress in the context of work (e.g., occupational stress, psychische Belastung bei der Arbeit, Burnout, Irritation) or uses models/measures explicitly tied to workplace strain, such as Lazarus’s transactional stress model applied to job contexts. Examples of relevant content here include the “Irritation” questionnaire conceptualized between mental fatigue and illness in work settings and scales on perceived job characteristics (e.g., psychological job demands) or job-related attitudes when they link to stress experiences. Documents are non-relevant if they discuss “stress” only as a general trait or tolerance without a work context (e.g., the 5DCR “Stress Tolerance” facet), or focus on unrelated constructs like ecological responsibility, sensation seeking, need to evaluate, or general health anxiety and aggression with no occupational tie-in. Edge cases include procrastination, mood, anomie, or general job satisfaction: these become relevant only when analyzed as causes, correlates, or outcomes of work stress. German-language instruments or German samples enhance relevance only if the content centers on stress at work; otherwise, mere mention of “stress” or “Arbeit” without linkage to occupational stress is insufficient.
38053	social status	The user seeks guidance on how to conceptualize and measure social status in survey research, emphasizing occupational classification and indices (e.g., ISCO-coded ISEI, ESeC) alongside related demographic measures like main status vs. employment, marital/cohabitation, and sex/gender. They need advice on questionnaire standardization, coding procedures, and evidence of reliability/validity for comparative analyses.	A document is relevant if it treats social status as a position in the stratification system or socioeconomic hierarchy and explains how it is measured or transmitted, for example via ISEI, SIOPS, ESeC/EGP class schemes, or theories of intergenerational status inheritance. Highly relevant examples include guides to coding occupations to ISCO-08 for constructing ISEI, descriptions of class classification using employment relations, or studies showing how status position shapes attitudes toward education or motives for status maintenance. Variables that structure or proxy social status—such as main activity status (e.g., student, unemployed), employment status, and cultural capital (e.g., number of books)—are relevant when linked to socioeconomic resources or prestige; marital status/cohabitation are relevant only insofar as they are analyzed as components of or pathways to socioeconomic positioning. Non-relevant are items that use “status” in a purely legal or administrative sense (marital or civil status, “status quo”), or instruments unrelated to stratification (grit, speak-up behavior, survey incentives), unless they explicitly connect to social status outcomes. Edge cases include sex/gender measurement debates and justice-evaluation scales: they are only relevant if tied to patterns of social stratification or perceived inequality; likewise, technical discussions of occupational coding are relevant when they enable status indices, but not when they are purely about software or workflow.
38113	social mobility	The user seeks resources for measuring and analyzing social mobility and inequality, including frameworks like the EGP class scheme and intergenerational status models. They also want methodological guidance and data resources (surveys, mobile/digital behavioral data, and data linking) to conduct robust mobility research and address biases such as sample selectivity.	Relevant content for “social mobility” includes the discussion of the Erikson–Goldthorpe–Portocarero (EGP) class scheme and its cross-national operationalization, because class schemas are core tools for constructing mobility tables and comparing intergenerational and intragenerational mobility across Germany, France, and Great Britain. The mention of the (Blau–)Duncan intergenerational status-attainment model and how educational values transmit status is also directly pertinent to explaining mechanisms of social mobility. By contrast, much of the document focuses on “mobile” data collection, smartphone sensing, and mixed-device web surveys—uses of the word “mobile” that are unrelated to social mobility and would be non-relevant. An edge case is the Microcensus panel’s “spatial mobility” selectivity: while it concerns geographic moves (not class mobility), it could indirectly affect social-mobility analyses by biasing longitudinal samples if movers differ systematically. Measures of attitudes to inequality or welfare can be tangentially relevant only if they are used as predictors or outcomes in mobility research, but on their own they do not document social mobility.
38133	sozial	The user is seeking German-language social science survey instruments and short-form scales—along with their validation and use—covering topics such as social openness, neighborhood social control and discrimination, workplace social stressors, need for social approval, egocentric networks, inequality and mobility, social desirability, self-monitoring, right-wing authoritarianism, anomie, socio-political attitudes, and curiosity (5DCR). They likely want measures applicable to panel studies and cognitive pretests, e.g., in the “Leben im Viertel” neighborhood research context.	A document is relevant if it uses the German word “sozial” (including inflected forms like soziale/sozialen/sozialer and compounds) to discuss social constructs, behaviors, or policies, such as soziale Offenheit, soziale Kontrolle, soziale Ungleichheit, Sozialpolitik, soziale Erwünschtheit, or egozentrierte soziale Netzwerke. Examples that clearly match include questionnaires or scales on social desirability (KSE-G), social stressors at work, contact functions with outgroups (including a Soziale Identitätsfunktion), or assessments of Sozialleistungen and their effects. It may be partially relevant when “sozial” appears only within compound nouns (e.g., Sozialpolitik, Sozialleistungen) or hyphenated/spaced variants (sozial-politisch, Sozio Politische), or in descriptions like “soziales Umfeld,” but not when it appears solely in metadata, brand names, or citations without substantive discussion. Edge cases include OCR or spacing variants, capitalization at sentence starts, or related terms like “gesellschaftlich” that are conceptually similar but lack the exact token “sozial”; English “social” may be missed if strict exact matching is required. Frequent, context-rich occurrences across different sections or instrument names generally increase relevance.
3856	generationen	The user likely wants to understand how “generations” are defined and analyzed in social research—using age and birth cohort—and how intergenerational familial obligations and support (e.g., financial aid) are measured and judged as fair. They may also seek how surveys capture age/cohort and apply these variables in multivariate analyses.	A document is relevant if it treats “Generationen” in the sociological/demographic sense—e.g., intergenerational obligations, fairness of support (financial or care), and the distribution of duties between age groups or cohorts. Mentions of age and birth year used to derive cohorts, labels like Nachkriegsgeneration or Baby Boomer, and terms such as intergenerationale Unterstützung or Generationenvertrag strengthen relevance, especially when measurement instruments or methods are described. Non-relevant items use “generationen” in unrelated meanings, such as power/content generation, product “generations” (e.g., 3rd‑generation devices), or texts that discuss age without linking it to cohorts or intergenerational relations. Edge cases include generic phrases like “für alle Generationen” (weakly relevant without analysis) or “Generationenwechsel” in organizational contexts (conditionally relevant if not tied to social support or cohort effects). German texts using compounds like generationenübergreifend or intergenerationale Gerechtigkeit in family or social policy contexts are likely relevant, whereas technical or biological “generation” processes are not.
3938	gender	The user wants guidance on measuring gender in surveys, especially in the German context—covering distinctions between sex and gender, current response options (male, female, diverse), and alternatives for capturing gender identity. They also seek validated instruments for gender role attitudes and related constructs, with evidence of cross-gender measurement invariance.	A document is highly relevant to the query “gender” when gender is the core construct being theorized or measured, such as analyses of gender role orientations, debates over recording sex versus gender identity in surveys, or instruments that assess sexist attitudes (e.g., ambivalent sexism toward men). It remains relevant when the study’s primary focus is explicitly gendered processes or outcomes, like changing gender roles in society or the impact of gender diversity on measurement. By contrast, documents are weakly relevant or non-relevant when “gender” appears only as a routine demographic control, sampling quota, or invariance grouping (e.g., scales on curiosity, gratitude, ICT competence, or study satisfaction merely reporting “scalar invariance across gender” or controlling for evaluators’ gender). Edge cases include tools embedded in modules named for gender (e.g., work–family conflict in a “Changing Gender Roles” module) where the target of measurement is not gender itself, and scales that mention gender only as an example of an ascribed characteristic in broader justice or efficacy constructs. Also non-relevant would be uses of “gender” referring to grammatical gender rather than social gender, whereas discussions distinguishing biological sex, civil status sex, and gender identity are directly relevant.
39449	sozialleistungen	The user seeks information or a survey framework for evaluating social policy and social benefits across four dimensions: living standards, economic effects, social effects, and recipient dependency/inertia. They want a concise assessment tool or analysis capturing perceptions of these impacts.	A document is relevant if it substantively discusses Sozialleistungen (public social benefits) within social policy, especially evaluations of their impact on living standards, their economic and social consequences, or recipient behavior (e.g., work disincentives/inertia). Examples include survey questionnaires assessing perceptions of welfare, analyses of unemployment benefits, child allowances, pensions, or Bürgergeld/ALG II, and studies on how transfers affect poverty, employment, or social cohesion. Synonyms and related terms like Sozialhilfe, Transferleistungen, Hartz IV, or benefits from health insurance within the welfare state also signal relevance. Documents are non-relevant if “Leistungen” refers to unrelated contexts (e.g., corporate perks, individual performance, or generic “services”), if the term appears only in passing, or if the piece is broad political commentary without concrete discussion of benefits. Edge cases include employer-provided “betriebliche Sozialleistungen” or country-specific frameworks (Austria/Switzerland) which are relevant only if explicitly connected to public welfare effects or evaluations.
40249	soziale herkunft	The user seeks German-language surveys and validated scales to study social origin (socioeconomic background) and its links to inequality, mobility, and social attitudes, including measures of social openness, control, discrimination, and related psychosocial constructs. They likely want instruments, methodologies (e.g., panel/neighborhood studies, web probing), and evidence on reliability and validity.	A document is relevant to “soziale Herkunft” if it defines or measures social origin/social background (e.g., parental education or occupation, class origin, SES in the family of origin) or analyzes intergenerational mobility using origin–destination frameworks. By contrast, materials focused only on attitudes or personality constructs—such as social desirability (KSE-G), Right-Wing Authoritarianism, curiosity scales, self-monitoring, or neighborhood openness/control—are not relevant unless they explicitly link those outcomes to respondents’ social origin. Sections on “Aufstiegsmobilität” or “soziale Ungleichheit” become relevant only if they examine mobility conditional on class/parental background or include variables/proxies for Herkunft (e.g., “sozialer Hintergrund,” “Schicht,” “Elternhaus”). Items about intergenerational obligations, evaluation of social policy, or reasons for not using cessation aids are at most indirectly relevant and only count if used to compare groups by social origin. Edge cases include studies on immigrant integration or neighborhood discrimination that are relevant only when they treat parental SES/class or origin milieu as explanatory factors; instruments like ego-centered network name generators or workplace social stressors are non-relevant.
4027	migrationshintergrund	The user seeks information on how “migration background” is defined and operationalized in German surveys, especially the Microcensus (2005–2009) and PIAAC-L, including typologies, reconstruction methods, and survey items. They also want validated instruments for measuring ethnic and national identity and guidance on methodological comparability across datasets and labor-force concepts.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses the German concept of “Migrationshintergrund,” such as defining it, typologizing it, or operationalizing it in surveys and datasets (e.g., Mikrozensus 2005–2009 or PIAAC-L), including guidance or code (SAS/SPSS/Stata) to derive the variable. Studies that develop or validate instruments for people with and without migration background, or that include questionnaire items on origin culture, migration background, and related demographics, also qualify. By contrast, materials focused on employment measurement concepts (Labour Force vs. Unterhaltskonzept) or identity in general that do not link outcomes to migration background are non-relevant. Edge cases include pre-2008 datasets that provide methods to reconstruct a migration-background variable (relevant), English synonyms like “migrant/immigrant background” (relevant), and documents with only passing mentions without definitions, measures, or analysis tied to migration background (likely not relevant). Irrelevant homonyms such as “background migration” in IT or biology should be excluded.
4034	soziale ungleichheit	The user seeks information on social inequality with a focus on German survey research, especially ALLBUS modules, cognitive pretests, and measurement instruments. They want resources on attitudes toward inequality, income/wealth distribution graphics, the EGP class schema, and links between perceived inequality and populist attitudes.	A document is relevant if it analyzes, measures, or explains social inequality—such as the distribution of income and wealth, class/stratification and mobility, public attitudes toward inequality, or policy consequences for inequality. Strong examples include ALLBUS modules on attitudes to social inequality, an egalitarianism/meritocracy scale that justifies or critiques inequality, projects that present income/wealth graphics to shift perceived inequality and populist views, or methodological work on the EGP class schema used to operationalize social stratification. Studies on neighborhood openness or social control are relevant when they explicitly link to egalitarian attitudes or inequality outcomes, and evaluations of social policy are pertinent when they assess effects on socio-economic disparities. By contrast, instruments on social desirability (e.g., KSE-G), social recognition needs, workplace social stressors, smoking-cessation barriers, student problems, contact-function inventories, or anomie are non-relevant unless they directly connect to inequality. Edge cases include methodological pretests that merely mention “soziale Ungleichheit” without substantive content, or instances where the term appears only in citations; documents using related terms like class, stratification, mobility, or wealth distribution still qualify as relevant.
40380	soziale lage	The user seeks frameworks and instruments to conceptualize and measure social position (soziale Lage), especially in German and comparative surveys. They want guidance on indicators and operationalizations—e.g., occupational prestige (MPS), the EGP class schema, occupational classifications and mappings (ISCO/KldB, Blossfeld), applications to datasets like the Mikrozensus, and related scales on inequality, mobility, and social desirability.	A document is relevant to the query “soziale lage” if it defines, measures, or operationalizes individuals’ or households’ social position in a stratification framework, for example via occupational prestige (MPS), class schemas (EGP/CASMIN), or proxies in official statistics (e.g., identifying the household’s main income earner in the Mikrozensus). Highly relevant examples include studies that map the Magnitude Prestige Scale to occupational classifications (ISCO vs. KldB), construct EGP classes from national labor data, or reconstruct socioeconomic position measures for specific datasets and time periods. Work on social inequality and mobility is relevant when it explicitly links outcomes to status indicators such as class, prestige, education, income, or employment position, or when it provides scales or coding schemes to estimate these. Documents are non-relevant if they focus on other psychosocial constructs (e.g., social desirability, anomie, workplace social stressors, contact functions, neighborhood social control/openness, smoking-cessation barriers) without measuring or analyzing social position. Edge cases include papers that mention “soziale Lage” only rhetorically, or analyze outcomes (e.g., student problems) by class/status without detailing how status is measured; conversely, texts using close synonyms like “sozio-ökonomische Lage,” “Status,” “Prestige,” “Klasse/Schicht,” or “Berufsprestige” are relevant even if the exact phrase does not appear.
40505	soziale kontakte	The user seeks German-language survey instruments and research for measuring social contacts and related constructs—especially motivations for intercultural contact, acculturation orientations, neighborhood social openness/control, egocentric networks, and social desirability/stressors.	A document is relevant to “soziale kontakte” if it directly examines social interactions or networks, or provides tools to measure contact behavior and opportunities for contact. Clear hits include instruments like the Kontaktfunktionsinventar (KFI-30) on motives for intergroup contact, name generators for egocentric social networks, neighborhood “social openness/social control” measures, and scales on workplace relationship stressors, because they address how contacts are formed, maintained, or constrained. Partial relevance applies to constructs such as need for social recognition, social proximity, feelings of social rejection, or self-monitoring: these shape interpersonal behavior but do not measure social contacts themselves. Non-relevant items are scales on social desirability bias (e.g., Crowne–Marlowe, KSE-G), social inequality/egalitarianism, anomie, lying/denial, social policy evaluations, or reasons for not using smoking-cessation aids, since they center on attitudes or behaviors unrelated to contact. An edge case is acculturation (AKOrM): while acculturation theory invokes contact, documents are only relevant if they operationalize contact (e.g., frequency or breadth of cross-cultural interactions) rather than cultural orientation alone.
40541	soziale kompetenzen	The user is looking for information on social competencies, specifically definitions, dimensions, and validated instruments to measure social skills and related psychosocial constructs across contexts (workplace, education, community). They likely want scales/questionnaires, their development and validation, and how they are used in surveys and evaluations.	A document is relevant to “soziale kompetenzen” when it defines, operationalizes, or measures social skills such as communication, cooperation, empathy, conflict management, or teamwork ability, ideally via validated scales or behavioral assessments. For example, a questionnaire that rates employees’ interpersonal effectiveness in teams or a scale assessing adolescents’ social interaction competence would fit well. By contrast, instruments on political efficacy (PEKS), ICT/literacy competencies (PIAAC), body experience, social stressors at work, social desirability or need for approval, attitudes toward social inequality, neighborhood social control/openness, or didactic competence of instructors are non-relevant because they address attitudes, environments, or non-social domains rather than social skill capacities. Edge cases include tools that mention “Kompetenz” or “soziale” in other contexts (e.g., general or didactic competence, presence of team work without assessing team skills), which are only relevant if they explicitly evaluate social skill performance; broad batteries with subscales like “soziale Nähe” or “soziale Attraktivität” are at most tangential unless linked to functional social capability. Measures of egocentric social networks (name generators) describe relationship structure, not competence, and are only relevant if used to assess social skill use.
40674	soziale arbeit	The user is seeking German-language, validated survey instruments and documentation guidelines for social work/social science research, covering a wide range of psychosocial constructs (e.g., social desirability, self-monitoring, workplace stressors, distributive justice, recognition needs, environmental norms, sensation seeking, procrastination). They want tools, short forms, and evidence on reliability/validity for use in written and mixed-mode surveys, panel studies, and egocentric network name generators.	A document is relevant to “soziale arbeit” when it addresses the profession/discipline of social work in Germany—e.g., practice settings, client assessment, community integration, policy, or interventions—and explicitly links tools or findings to social work tasks. For example, content on neighborhood social control/openness and integration of Muslim immigrants, mapping egocentric support networks, or assessing social stressors at the workplace can be relevant if positioned as resources for casework, community work, or occupational social work. Psychometric catalogs (e.g., social desirability, sensation seeking, procrastination, distribution justice scales) or survey documentation guidelines are non-relevant if presented purely methodologically without application to social work practice, education, or policy. Edge cases include items that use “soziale” language (e.g., “soziale Attraktivität,” “Arbeitsorientierung”) but concern general psychology or labor studies; these are only relevant if the document shows how social workers would use the measures for client assessment, program evaluation, or service design. Conversely, research in sociology that informs anti-discrimination or empowerment work in communities becomes relevant when it offers actionable insights or tools for social work contexts.
41495	soziale medien	The user seeks information on the social media components of the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) 2021 pretests—specifically which questions were developed and cognitively tested to measure access, usage, and personal network size for internet-based communication services, and how these relate to politics, society, and social trust.	A document is relevant if it directly addresses social media (soziale Medien) usage, access, effects, or measurement—such as the GLES 2021 pretest modules on social media, politics, and society. It is also relevant if it measures communication via internet-based services or platforms as part of media use (e.g., items capturing access, use, and personal network size for internet-based services in the Information Flows and Trust Levels project). Non-relevant content includes scales on social desirability, social inequality, neighborhood control, workplace social stressors, or teacher self-concept “Medien” competencies, since these are not about social media platforms or behaviors. Edge cases are “soziale Netzwerke” used in the sociological sense (ego-centered networks) or references to “Medien” in the context of mass media coverage of surveys—these share terms with social media but are different phenomena unless explicitly tied to online platforms. Likewise, studies that merely use online methods (e.g., web probing) are not about social media unless they analyze platform-based content or interactions.
41546	soziale netzwerke	The user is looking for research methods and tools to study social networks, especially measuring egocentric networks (name generators, survey items, ECN/RDS approaches) and practical guidelines for recruiting participants via social networking sites like Facebook and Instagram.	A document is relevant if it treats “soziale Netzwerke” as either interpersonal network structures or online social network sites—for example, egocentric network name generators, measures of network size, methods that combine ECN with respondent-driven sampling, or guidelines for recruiting via Facebook/Instagram ad targeting. It is also relevant if it surveys network members or provides concrete operationalizations of network constructs (e.g., prompts about people one shares specific social situations with). By contrast, texts that only address general “social” constructs without network structure—such as social desirability scales, anomie, workplace social stressors, attitudes toward social inequality, or evaluations of social policy—are non-relevant. Edge cases include uses of “Netzwerk” to mean an institutional or research network (e.g., the PIAAC Leibniz network) without analyzing interpersonal ties, and studies on neighborhood “social openness/control” or intergroup contact motives that discuss social relations but do not model ties or platforms, which would be at best borderline. Mentions of social media are relevant only when they detail platform-based recruitment, targeting parameters, or sampling flows on SNS.
4160	stress	The user is seeking information on validated instruments to measure stress and related constructs in social science and occupational contexts, especially scales grounded in Lazarus’s transactional stress model. They want details on dimensions, psychometric properties (e.g., Rasch scalability, reliability/validity), and applications such as teacher/nurse workload, irritation, and stress tolerance.	A document is relevant to the query “stress” when it treats stress as a psychological or occupational construct, such as discussing the Lazarus transactional stress model, measuring experienced stress with validated scales (e.g., Rasch-scaled instruments with reported reliability like .93–.94), or describing related phenomena like psychophysical overload, cognitive/emotional irritation, mental impairment, and stressors in work contexts (teachers, nurses). Content that operationalizes stress in surveys (e.g., scales for perceived workload, stress tolerance, or facets linked to stress) is also relevant, especially when it details development, reliability/validity, and use in health or organizational research. By contrast, uses of “stress” as a verb meaning “to emphasize” (e.g., advance letters that “stress the importance” of a survey) are not relevant to the stress construct. Edge cases include instruments where “stress” is only a facet name within another primary construct (e.g., a curiosity scale listing “stress tolerance”): this is weakly relevant unless the text actually analyzes stress as such. Similarly, mentions of “stress” in unrelated domains (mechanical stress, financial stress tests) or purely metaphorical uses should be considered non-relevant.
41655	soziale mobilität	The user seeks information on social mobility—especially upward mobility—in the German context, including how it is measured and what factors influence it. They are interested in methodological issues (e.g., selective residential mobility bias in the Mikrozensus panel) and related constructs such as neighborhood social openness/control, discrimination, social inequality, and socio-political attitudes.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses social mobility (soziale Mobilität) as movement in socioeconomic status across or within generations—such as upward/downward mobility, class/income transitions, or educational attainment pathways—and discusses determinants, measurement, or outcomes. Analyses using longitudinal data to estimate mobility or correct biases that affect mobility estimates (e.g., sample selectivity in the German Mikrozensuspanel due to selective residential moves) are directly relevant, as are mentions like Aufstiegsmobilität and Bildungsverläufe linked to status change. By contrast, materials focused solely on räumliche Mobilität (residential moves), psychometric scales (social desirability, workplace stress, authoritarianism, anomie), or general attitudes (inequality, social policy) without connecting them to status attainment or intergenerational mobility are non-relevant. Edge cases include instruments on social networks, neighborhood openness, or contact with outgroups that become relevant only if they are explicitly tied to opportunity structures or mobility processes. Mere occurrence of “sozial” or “Mobilität” without an explicit discussion of socioeconomic status change should not be treated as relevant.
4182	stress am arbeitsplatz	The user is seeking information on workplace stress—particularly social stressors and psychological irritation—and the validated German instruments and surveys used to measure it. They want sources such as the BIBB/BAuA employee surveys and related scales (e.g., Irritation, Human Flourishing, 5DCR, informal workplace learning) that assess stress, well-being, and digital work conditions.	A document is relevant if it directly addresses workplace stress, such as social stressors at work, irritation (between mental fatigue and disorder), or models/measures grounded in the transactional stress model (e.g., scales for cognitive and emotional irritation). Reports from the BIBB/BAuA Erwerbstätigenbefragungen that cover work demands, workload, health impairments, leadership, team work, or home office can be relevant when they assess strain/beanspruchung or stress-related outcomes. Measures like the 5DCR (only its Stress Tolerance facet) or the Human Flourishing Scale are relevant if they are explicitly linked to stress at work or used to evaluate how workplace conditions affect well-being; otherwise they are peripheral. Instruments on informal learning at the workplace are non-relevant unless they analyze how such learning behaviors mitigate or exacerbate stress/strain. Edge cases include ICT-at-work pretests, which are relevant when they probe digital work conditions and associated stress but not when they solely assess skills/usage, and documents where “stress” refers to non-psychological or non-work contexts (e.g., mechanical stress or student stress).
427	migration	The user is looking for resources to operationalize and measure migration and integration in Germany, including how immigrant background is classified in the German Microcensus (2005–2009). They also seek validated, multilingual instruments (with reliability/invariance evidence) for assessing ethnic/national identity, discrimination, health, belonging, and cross-cultural loss among migrants and refugees, plus implementation details in SAS/SPSS/Stata.	A document is relevant if it addresses human migration or immigrant/refugee contexts, such as classifying “migration background,” measuring integration, identity, discrimination, health, or belonging among migrant populations. For example, reports on the German Microcensus 2005–2009 immigrant background classification, or studies validating ethnic/national identity (MEIM-R), Everyday Discrimination Scale, SF-12, or a Challenged Sense of Belonging Scale in German/Arabic/Dari among migrants and refugees, clearly match the query. Methodological pieces that provide SAS/SPSS/Stata code to classify immigrant background are also relevant because they enable migration research, as are psychometric analyses (reliability, measurement invariance) conducted specifically in migrant samples or international students experiencing cross-cultural loss. Non-relevant items include uses of “migration” in unrelated domains (data/software migration, bird or cell migration) or studies where “migration” is only mentioned in passing without analysis of migrant status, integration, or related outcomes. Edge cases include general health or belonging measures: they are relevant if applied to or compared across groups with and without a migration background, but less so if validated only in the general population without a migration focus.
43444	consumer	The user seeks an explanation of consumer ethnocentrism and the scale used to measure it (15-item short or 20-item long). They want to know how the belief in domestic product superiority extends beyond functional attributes to economic, social, and moral considerations, leading to opposition to buying foreign goods.	A document is relevant to the query “consumer” if it discusses people who buy or use goods and services, their attitudes or behaviors, market dynamics affecting them, or policies/rights concerning them. The provided paragraph is relevant because it examines consumer ethnocentrism, describing a scale that measures consumers’ beliefs about domestic versus foreign products and the economic, social, and moral reasoning behind those beliefs. Documents are non-relevant when “consumer” is used in technical or non-market senses (e.g., software message-queue consumers, the Java Consumer<T> interface, or ecological trophic “consumers”), or as a brand name. Edge cases include terms like “customer,” “end-user,” or “consumption”: these are relevant if they pertain to people purchasing/using products, but not if they refer to resource consumption metrics or medical “consumption.” Empirical studies, surveys, and scales about consumer attitudes (e.g., 15- or 20-item measures) are relevant, while pieces focused solely on producers or macro factors without reference to consumers are less relevant.
43910	covid	Seeks information on a student course evaluation questionnaire developed/used during the COVID-19 pandemic to assess digital teaching, including its use at WWU Münster and suitability for digital and hybrid formats.	A document is relevant to the query “covid” if it explicitly references COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus pandemic, or pandemic-driven changes (e.g., lockdowns, remote or hybrid teaching), even when COVID is not the primary topic. The provided paragraph is relevant because it ties a course-evaluation questionnaire to digital teaching introduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic and situates it in pandemic semesters (summer 2020, winter 2020/21, summer 2021). Documents that only mention general teaching evaluations without linking them to COVID-related changes would be non-relevant, as would uses of “covid” as an unrelated acronym or mentions limited to metadata or boilerplate. Edge cases include variant spellings or synonyms (COVID 19 with a space, Covid-19, Corona pandemic) and incidental mentions like “COVID-era” timing; these are relevant but weaker than content that analyzes impacts, policies, or outcomes directly tied to COVID. Content about post-COVID adaptations or Long COVID also counts if the connection is clear; vague or offhand references without substantive linkage do not.
44361	culture	The user seeks resources on cross-cultural survey methodology and measurement, including questionnaire translation, web probing, sampling/harmonization, and validated scales for cultural intelligence, acculturation, cultural capital, national/political pride, religiosity, and related attitudes. They want evidence on reliability, validity, and measurement invariance across languages and contexts.	A document is relevant to the query “culture” when it engages culture as a social or intercultural construct—e.g., acculturation (host vs. origin cultures), cultural intelligence, cultural capital, national/cultural pride, or cross-cultural measurement and translation—and uses terms like intercultural, cross-cultural, socio-cultural, or cultural orientation substantively. Studies that validate scales across languages or groups and explicitly model cultural processes (Berry’s acculturation model, cultural metacognition, multicultural experience) are highly relevant, as are guidelines on cultural adequacy in questionnaire translation and harmonization for cross-cultural surveys. Content is only weakly or not relevant when “culture” appears incidentally (a funding body named “Ministry of Science and Culture,” a family-climate subscale labeled “intellectual cultural orientation”) or when methods like sampling are discussed without a cross-cultural focus. Measures of religiosity or attitudes toward foreigners become relevant if framed as cross-cultural beliefs or contact with other cultures, but not if they treat religion or politics without a cultural dimension. Edge cases include uses from other domains (e.g., cell culture in biology) or superficial “cultural adaptation” that merely localizes wording; these should be excluded unless the text analyzes cultural constructs or intercultural comparability.
4472	stress work	The user wants resources for assessing workplace stress, specifically validated survey instruments and scales (e.g., Lazarus-based) that measure dimensions like workload, irritation, and working atmosphere, with information on their reliability and use in social science or occupational health research.	A document is relevant if it addresses psychological stress in the workplace—its measurement, antecedents, or consequences—such as scales capturing occupational stress, perceived workload, psychophysical overload, irritation, burnout-like symptoms, or work–family conflict, especially when grounded in models like Lazarus’s transactional stress model. Examples include instruments assessing nurses’ subjective workload (coordination/information problems, psychophysical overload), teachers’ experienced stress shaping teacher–student interaction, or occupational health questionnaires measuring cognitive and emotional irritation and psychosomatic complaints from ongoing work stressors. Content that links stress theory to job contexts, even if focused on psychometrics (e.g., Rasch scalability, reliability/validity), is also relevant. Non-relevant items include uses of “stress” as “emphasize” (e.g., advance letters that “stress” survey importance), constructs where “stress” is incidental or unrelated to work (e.g., curiosity “stress tolerance”), work attitudes without a stress focus (alienation from work, pay satisfaction), or technical guides unrelated to workplace stress (e.g., YouTube Data API, data merges). Edge cases are documents discussing general stress models with no job application, or work-related behaviors like procrastination that may relate to stress but are not explicitly framed as work stress; these require explicit linkage to occupational stress to count as relevant.
45770	climate change attitudes	The user seeks research and data on how people think and feel about climate change, including how these attitudes are measured, what factors influence them, and how they vary across groups and over time. They may also be interested in links between attitudes, communication exposure, and pro-environmental behaviors.	A document is relevant if it directly measures or analyzes attitudes toward climate change, such as belief in human-caused warming, concern or risk perception, and support for mitigation/adaptation policies, or if it examines drivers of these attitudes (e.g., media exposure, values) using surveys, experiments, or behavioral data. In this paragraph, the web-tracking guide could be marginally relevant only when it explicitly studies climate change communication’s effects on attitudes, and the brief scale on awareness of consequences for global environmental changes might serve as a proxy for climate attitudes if tied to climate-specific items or outcomes. By contrast, instruments about gender role attitudes, family/organizational/teaching “climate,” authority, acculturation, welfare state views, managerial practices, and occupational class schemes are non-relevant, as “climate” here denotes social environment rather than climate change. Edge cases include methodological resources that do not report attitudes themselves but provide tools or datasets that could infer climate attitudes; these count only if applied to climate topics or accompanied by attitude findings. Passing mentions of climate change or general methods (e.g., LLM overviews, EGP class coding, life events) without a clear link to climate change attitudes should be treated as non-relevant.
45793	climate	The user is looking for how "climate" is defined and measured in social science research—covering family, teaching, and organizational climate scales—and how climate-related topics (e.g., climate change communication) can be examined using web tracking data.	This document is relevant if “climate” refers to psychosocial or organizational climates, since it details instruments that measure family climate (e.g., positive emotional climate, active leisure, organization, control, intellectual-cultural orientation), teaching climate (social relations, aggression against the teacher, cooperation, disciplinary violations, emotionality), and an Occupational and Organizational Climate Index (BOKX) that captures meaning and competence. It is also relevant to readers seeking methodological guidance on web tracking as a research method, with a minor example that such data can be used to study climate change communication. However, it is largely non-relevant for users seeking information on meteorological or environmental climate, such as greenhouse gases, temperature trends, climate modeling, or adaptation/mitigation policy. An edge case is a user interested specifically in “climate change communication” methods: the guide provides a conceptual pathway via web tracking but does not focus on climate science or communication theory in depth. Conversely, a user looking for validated scales or short screening tools for classroom, family, or workplace climate would find highly pertinent, actionable detail here.
4600	gewalt	The user is looking for validated German-language measurement scales related to violence, including pro-violence attitudes, violent behavior and self-reported juvenile delinquency, authoritarian and Machiavellian dispositions, and teachers’ bullying-related self-efficacy. They want instruments (largely from the University of Bielefeld’s “Youth and Violence” projects) with information on development and psychometric properties.	A document is relevant to the query “gewalt” when it directly addresses violence as a phenomenon, attitude, or behavior—such as discussing approval of physical force, violent acts, or instruments that measure violent tendencies. For example, descriptions of scales assessing violence-supportive attitudes, youth violent behavior (e.g., against persons or property), or self-reported delinquency that explicitly includes violent offenses, as well as studies from projects like “Jugend und Gewalt,” are clearly relevant. Content on related constructs (e.g., authoritarian or Machiavellian orientations) is relevant only when these are examined in relation to violence (prediction, correlation, or intervention); purely theoretical treatments without a violence link are less relevant. Bullying/mobbing measures count if they address violence in school contexts (e.g., teacher self-efficacy in handling student bullying), whereas general self-efficacy not tied to aggression is not. Edge cases that are non-relevant include uses of “Gewalt” in other senses (force majeure, separation of powers) or mere name-drops without substantive discussion; mixed-offense delinquency scales are marginally relevant if the violent component is explicitly represented in items or findings.
46134	care arbeit	The query seeks information on the German “Who cares” project examining care work for dependent persons, particularly estimating the prevalence and conditions of foreign/undocumented caregivers in private households using the Person Count Technique and a web-probed cognitive pretest. It also asks about the survey instruments employed, including German versions of standard psychometric scales (e.g., work orientation, procrastination, sensation seeking, social desirability, environmental norms, health anxiety, aggression, job satisfaction, awareness of consequences).	A document is relevant if it discusses care work (Care-Arbeit) in the German context, especially caregiving for dependent persons in private households, whether paid or unpaid. It becomes highly relevant when it uses terms like Fürsorgearbeit/Pflegearbeit, pflegebedürftige Personen, ausländische oder illegale Pflegekräfte, or describes methods to study hidden care labor such as the Person Count Technique, cognitive online pretests, or web probing. By contrast, material that primarily lists psychometric scales (e.g., procrastination, sensation seeking, aggression, general job satisfaction) without a clear link to caregiving or care labor practice is non-relevant. Edge cases include false positives about customer care/IT support or jobs at the NGO CARE (“CARE Arbeit”), while broader analyses of eldercare/childcare policy or unpaid domestic care in Germany remain relevant even without exact keywords. Clinical “patient care” content is only borderline relevant unless it explicitly addresses caregiving labor or household-based care arrangements.
4690	gesundheit	The user seeks information on German health-related surveys and validated measurement instruments, including tools for mental and physical health, workplace psychosocial climate, physical activity/active transport, preventive health behavior, COVID-19 social networks, and well-being/flourishing. They want documentation on instrument development, pretesting, and validation (e.g., work addiction scales, BOKX, PSC, Human Flourishing Scale).	A document is relevant if it centers on health (Gesundheit) in German, such as discussing physical or mental health outcomes, behaviors, or measurement tools—e.g., scales for work addiction, Psychosocial Safety Climate, WHO-referenced physical activity, skin cancer screening decisions, or RKI health monitoring. Content linking health to related constructs like well-being (Wohlbefinden/Flourishing), organizational support for psychological health, or survey modules on health within panels (e.g., FReDA, STEP) is also clearly relevant. Multi-topic surveys are relevant when health is a substantive module rather than a passing mention (for instance, questions on patient satisfaction with medical visits or active transport qualify). Non-relevant or borderline cases include documents where “Gesundheit” appears only as a proper name or keyword in a project title without health-focused content, or where the focus is organizational climate or policy reforms with no health dimension. Edge cases include texts that use “Gesundheit!” as an interjection, translations that use “health” without the German term (potentially missed by strict keyword matching), or demographic variables like age discussed without any explicit link to health.
47291	drug	Information about how drug offenses are defined and assessed within an adolescent self-report delinquency scale that includes 16 items across theft, property damage, violent crimes, and drug-related offenses.	A document is relevant to the query "drug" if it discusses drugs or drug-related topics, such as drug use, drug offences, controlled substances, medications, or policies and testing around them. The provided paragraph is relevant because it explicitly includes “drug offences” among the crime areas measured by a self-reported delinquency scale. In contrast, content that focuses only on theft, property damage, or violent crimes without mentioning drugs would be non-relevant. Edge cases include texts that use synonyms like narcotics, controlled substances, or medications (relevant), or documents where “drug” appears only incidentally in a footnote or reference list (marginal). Also, uses of “drug” as a dialect past tense of “drag” or in unrelated phrases/brand names should not be treated as relevant.
4835	media	The user seeks expert overviews and practical guides on media—especially social media—within computational social science, focusing on methods and ethics. Topics include visual content analysis, misinformation detection with NLP, web tracking, data linking, algorithmic fairness, media-based empathy measurement, studying vulnerable communities, democracy impacts, and mobile data collection.	A document is relevant to the query “media” when it substantively focuses on communication media—e.g., social media platforms, digital media use, media effects, visual media (images/videos), or measurement of media-related constructs. Highly relevant examples include discussions of analyzing images and videos in political communication, detecting misinformation on social media, web tracking of digital media use, media-based empathy scales (e.g., MBE), and reviews on social media and democracy. Partially relevant are pieces on methods or ethics that apply broadly to online systems but explicitly center their applications in social media contexts (e.g., fairness in socio-technical systems or studying vulnerable communities online), whereas general methodological content without a clear media focus is weaker. Non-relevant results include mentions of “media” only in proper names (e.g., conference titles), incidental subscale labels in unrelated instruments (e.g., “media diagnostics” in a teacher self-concept tool), or false substring matches like “immediate.” Edge cases include uses of “media” outside communication (e.g., biological culture media or brand names); unless tied to communication channels or content, these should be treated as non-relevant.
49615	digitalization	The user seeks an overview of digitalization’s role in social science research and education—methods for collecting, linking, and analyzing digital behavioral data (web tracking, mobile sensing), along with ethical and fairness considerations and applications to health and democracy. They also want validated instruments and classifications suited to digital contexts, such as IDR‑24 for digital readiness, the MBE empathy scale, and occupational/class schemes like ESeC and Blossfeld.	A document is relevant to “digitalization” when it discusses the transformation of practices, services, or research into digital environments, including the skills, infrastructures, and governance needed for that shift. For example, pieces on Individual Digital Readiness (IDR-24) for online teaching, guides to web tracking and mobile sensing, or work on digital behavioral data and associated ethical challenges directly address digitalization in education and the social sciences. Analyses of social media’s impact on democracy, network analysis of online traces, or algorithmic fairness also qualify because they examine societal consequences of pervasive digitalization. By contrast, content on occupational or socioeconomic classifications (e.g., Blossfeld’s scheme, ESeC) is non-relevant unless it specifically treats how those systems are being digitized or used to study digital transitions. Edge cases include documents that merely use digital tools without reflecting on digital transformation, or that mention “digital” only in passing; also, items focused on “digitization” (simple analog-to-digital conversion) may be borderline unless they link to broader organizational or societal change.
50072	digital	The user seeks comprehensive resources on studying digital behavior in social science, including methods like web tracking, mobile sensing, data linking, and network analysis. They also want guidance on ethics and fairness, validated instruments (e.g., IDR-24, media-based empathy), and occupational/socioeconomic classifications (Blossfeld’s, ESeC), with applications to health and democracy.	A document is relevant to the query “digital” when its central topic concerns digital technologies, behaviors, data, or methods, rather than merely mentioning the term in passing. Highly relevant examples here include guides on web tracking and mobile data collection, interviews about digital behavioral data for health and fairness in socio-technical systems, and instruments like the IDR-24 for Individual Digital Readiness or student evaluations of digital teaching. Content on media-based empathy tailored to diverse digital media use also directly fits the query. By contrast, sections on Blossfeld’s Occupational Classification, ESeC coding, or microcensus occupational variables are non-relevant unless they explicitly tie those classifications to digital contexts; note the edge case where “three digit occupational variables” contains “digit” but not “digital,” which should not count as a match. Mentions of “digital” only in author bios, event names, or as a passing adjective without substantive discussion should be treated as weakly relevant.
50270	digital skills	The user is looking for validated instruments and guidance to measure digital skills/readiness and related competencies in education and workplace settings (e.g., digital teaching evaluations, IDR-24). They also seek expert insights on using web/mobile tracking and digital behavioral data for research, including ethical and fairness considerations when studying vulnerable communities and health topics.	A document is relevant to the query “digital skills” if it directly measures, evaluates, or defines individuals’ competencies for using digital technologies, such as scales of digital literacy/readiness or frameworks assessing skills needed for online learning and work. For example, the IDR-24 on Individual Digital Readiness—with subscales like digital participation, affinity for technology, autonomy, and willingness to learn—is highly relevant, and student instruments that explicitly gauge learners’ ability to navigate digital teaching environments could be relevant if they assess competencies rather than just course satisfaction. In contrast, occupational class schemes (Blossfeld, ESeC), cultural capital via number of books, general self-efficacy, teamwork SJT, need for cognition, cultural intelligence, and media-based empathy do not assess digital competencies and are therefore non-relevant. Method guides and interviews about web tracking, mobile sensing, health analytics, or algorithmic fairness are only tangentially relevant unless they operationalize or validate measures of digital skills (e.g., a digital literacy scale for participants or researchers). Edge cases include course-evaluation batteries focused on digital teaching features or ethics/methods discussions in digital contexts; these should be treated as non-relevant unless they contain explicit constructs, items, or validated scales that quantify digital skills.
505	diskriminierung	The user is seeking documentation on how neighborhood discrimination is measured in the “Leben im Viertel (LiV)” panel study of German cities. They want details on the newly developed survey items and web-probing pretest assessing perceived social openness, social control, gender equality, and attitudes toward outgroups, and their relation to egalitarian attitudes.	A document is highly relevant if it explicitly discusses Diskriminierung (discrimination), especially in social contexts like neighborhoods, perceived discrimination, or attitudes toward out-groups, as this paragraph does by measuring “Diskriminierung in der Nachbarschaft” within a panel study. Content that operationalizes or evaluates discrimination—e.g., survey items on perceived unfair treatment, social openness, social control, gender equality, or integration of Muslim immigrants—also counts as relevant, including methodological notes like cognitive pretests or web probing used to test such items. Related German terms (Benachteiligung, Ausgrenzung, Vorurteile) and discussions of egalitarian attitudes or pluralism that connect to discriminatory dynamics further strengthen relevance. Edge cases include documents that only mention the word “Diskriminierung” tangentially, use it in a different domain (e.g., signal discrimination in engineering), or discuss social control/openness without any reference to unfair treatment or prejudice—those would be non-relevant.
5065	sicherheitsempfinden	The user is seeking information on how to measure and analyze citizens’ subjective sense of security in municipalities—covering fear of crime, traffic safety, and perceptions of urban security work. They likely want methodological tools and survey approaches (e.g., EU AUDITS guidelines, cognitive online pretests/web probing) to inform local prevention policies.	A document is relevant if it discusses citizens’ perceived safety (Sicherheitsempfinden), such as surveys on fear of crime, perceived safety in traffic, or how residents judge municipal security efforts. Methodological content that explains how Sicherheitsempfinden is measured—e.g., cognitive online pretests, web probing, or European guidelines for security analysis—is also relevant because it operationalizes the concept. By contrast, items about objective crime rates, general safety regulations, or IT/cybersecurity “audits” are non-relevant when they do not address subjective feelings of safety. Edge cases include traffic-focused pieces: those analyzing perceived safety in traffic are relevant, while those limited to accident statistics or engineering standards are not; texts using synonyms like Sicherheitsgefühl or fear of crime should be considered relevant. The given paragraph is highly relevant because it centers on a project that surveys residents’ subjective Sicherheitsempfinden and details the pretesting methodology.
50992	digitalisierung arbeit	The user seeks information on how digitalization affects work and employment, including the adoption of digital technologies in workplaces and their impacts on jobs, skills, productivity, and working conditions.	A document is relevant to “digitalisierung arbeit” when it examines how digitalization or digital transformation affects work or employment—for example, changes to job tasks, skills, workplace organization, remote work, platforms, automation/AI, or Industry 4.0. It can also be relevant if it addresses policies, training, or organizational change tied to digitizing work processes and the worker experience in digital settings. The provided paragraph instead catalogs psychometric scales (e.g., procrastination, environmental responsibility, job satisfaction, perceived job characteristics) used in ALLBUS and related instruments, with no discussion of digital tools, technologies, or the digitization of work, so it is not relevant. It would only become tangentially relevant if these measures were explicitly analyzed in the context of digital transformation (e.g., how digital tools alter perceived job demands or satisfaction). Edge cases include texts using “digital” in non-technology senses or discussing digitization in unrelated domains (like archiving or environmental norms) without any link to work; these would be non-relevant.
5274	familie	The user is seeking German social science resources and survey instruments related to family, including Mikrozensus household/family/living-form typologies, methods for constructing bandsatzerweiterungen, and pretested items from FReDA and ISSP on family and gender roles. They also want measures and frameworks such as family support ideologies, domain-specific satisfaction, and the EGP class schema.	For the German keyword “familie,” a document is relevant if it directly examines families, family structures, or related typologies, such as analyses of household-family relationships, “Lebensformen,” or survey modules on family and gender roles. Examples include Mikrozensus reports on bandsatzerweiterungen that enable family-based variables, FReDA or ISSP pretests about partnership, fertility, childrearing, and transnational family support, or instruments measuring justice within the family. Compound terms containing “Familie” (e.g., familienbezogene Leitbilder, Familienformen) and closely linked concepts like Haushalte and Lebensformen are relevant when they describe composition, relationships, or behaviors within families. Edge cases include methodological or coding papers (e.g., SPSS reconstructions) that are relevant because they produce family variables, and general class schemas (EGP) that are only relevant if applied to family or household analyses; scales with a “Family” subdimension are tangential. Non-relevant items would be uses of “Familie” in unrelated senses (taxonomic or product “families”), as a passing mention without analytical focus, or as a proper name.
5275	democracy	Seeks expert, research-based insights on how social media and the internet influence democracy and political behavior, weighing participatory benefits against risks like polarization, hate speech, propaganda, and misinformation. Looks for findings summarized through Philipp Lorenz-Spreen’s systematic review and interview, with implications for policy and democratic stability.	A document is relevant to the query “democracy” when it substantively discusses democratic systems, norms, or outcomes—such as how social media affects participation, polarization, misinformation, or the stability and legitimacy of democratic institutions. Pieces that analyze related constructs (e.g., national pride) in direct connection to democratic integration or defense are also relevant, as are interviews or reviews summarizing research on democracy’s health and challenges. Brief or incidental mentions (e.g., a researcher’s bio or an event description) without tying back to democratic processes would be weakly relevant, and uses of “democracy” as a brand name, in a metaphor, or in mislabelled state titles (e.g., “Democratic People’s Republic of…”) are non-relevant. Edge cases include comparative discussions of authoritarianism if explicitly framed around its impact on democracy, or technology policy pieces that matter only if they connect platform rules to democratic rights, elections, or public discourse.
52895	inequality	The user seeks scholarly resources on how social inequality is conceptualized and measured, including class stratification (EGP), education coding in surveys, and validated justice-evaluation instruments (JEID, BSJO) with cross-national applications. They also want insights into algorithmic fairness and bias in computational social science and how these affect the assessment of inequality.	A document is relevant if it directly examines social or economic inequality—such as income or earnings distributions, social stratification and mobility, or attitudes toward fairness—using concepts like equity, justice, bias, or established measures (e.g., JEID or BSJO scales) and frameworks like the EGP class scheme. Empirical work that operationalizes, measures, or compares inequality across countries, or that links perceptions of inequality to outcomes, also qualifies (for example, latent profiles of inequality aversion or cross-national validation of justice scales). Content on algorithmic fairness is relevant when it ties bias in socio-technical systems to unequal impacts across groups, even in interview form. By contrast, pieces focused solely on survey methodology, education coding, or occupational taxonomies are only relevant if they explicitly connect those tools to unequal distributions or stratification; purely technical or biographical content is peripheral. Edge cases include education measurement essays that become relevant when framed around educational inequality or returns to education across groups, and class-scheme harmonization papers that matter when used to study comparative inequality rather than just coding conventions.
5335	social media nutzung	The user is seeking research-based information on social media usage, including how it is measured (e.g., in surveys and via data linkage), patterns and trends of use, and its societal or political implications.	A document is relevant if it explicitly discusses the use of social media (Nutzung sozialer Medien), such as access, frequency, user behavior, demographics, or platform impacts. Relevant examples here include the interview on social media and democracy and the guideline on linking surveys with Social Media data; items that measure “internetbasierte Dienste” or “Nutzung von Kommunikationsmitteln” can be relevant if they clearly include social platforms. Documents about other kinds of “Nutzung” (e.g., Solariennutzung), general ICT/IoT at the workplace, survey sampling, or topics like justice ideologies, political conservatism scales, smoking cessation, or immigration are non-relevant. Edge cases include pieces on “Geo Social Media” or “Web-Paradaten,” which are only relevant if they use those data to measure or analyze social media usage rather than just describing data infrastructure. Mentions of “Social” in program names (e.g., International Social Survey Programme) or “social justice” scales do not pertain to social media usage and should be excluded.
5377	social media use	The user is seeking academic guidance and expert insights on how to study and measure social media use and its effects. They want methods and tools (web/mobile tracking, NLP and image analysis, data linking with surveys/sensors) and discussions of issues like misinformation, political communication, vulnerable communities, fairness, and democratic impacts.	A document is relevant if it examines how people use social media—such as for news, political communication, or during crises—or if it presents methods to measure or analyze social media use (e.g., web tracking of platform activity, linking surveys to social media data, smartphone sensing of app behavior). Examples here include the interviews on misinformation detection in social media, analysis of visual content from political online platforms, the guide to web tracking for digital media use, the guideline on linking surveys with social media data, and the review on social media and democracy. Methodological or ethics pieces are relevant when they explicitly involve social media platforms or users’ social-media-based communications (e.g., studying vulnerable communities’ online communications on social networks). Non-relevant content includes general psychological or educational scales (ideology, happiness, justice, teacher self-concept), smoking-cessation questionnaires, or broad “media empathy” measures unless they specifically target or validate against social media use. Edge cases: texts that say “online behavior” or “media use” are only relevant if they clearly include social platforms, and fairness/algorithm discussions count only when tied to user behavior or data from social media.
53827	berufsabschluss	The user wants to understand what “Berufsabschluss” (vocational/professional qualification) means and how it is measured and classified in German Demographic Standards (ADM/ASI/Statistisches Bundesamt), including typical survey question wording and categories.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses “Berufsabschluss” (vocational/professional qualification), such as defining the term, listing categories, collecting it in surveys, or presenting data or policies about completed vocational qualifications. The provided paragraph is relevant because it names “Schul- und Berufsabschluss” as a measured demographic attribute in the Demographische Standards and describes pretesting survey questions that capture it across multiple modes. Related variants like “Berufsabschlüsse,” “beruflicher Abschluss,” “Ausbildungsabschluss,” or “Berufsausbildung abgeschlossen,” including hyphenation variants, also count when they clearly refer to completion of a vocational/professional qualification. Non-relevant items would discuss “Abschluss” in other senses (e.g., Vertragsabschluss, Saisonabschluss) or focus solely on academic degrees without linking them to vocational completion. Edge cases include documents that only mention the term in passing or in metadata (weakly relevant) and English texts using “vocational/professional qualification,” which are relevant if they clearly map to the German concept.
5407	medien	The user seeks information on how “media” is measured and examined across the cited projects—survey modules on social media (GLES 2021), items capturing access, usage, and network size for communication media, and the “media” dimension in the ERBSE‑L teacher self-concept instrument. They also want evidence on how media reporting and sampling methodology affect trust in survey results.	A document is relevant to the query “medien” if it substantively addresses media as channels or platforms—e.g., social media, communications media, or media use/access—such as modules on soziale Medien in the GLES 2021 pretest or questions capturing access and usage of Festnetz, Mobiltelefon, and internetbasierte Dienste. It is also relevant when “Medien” is a defined analytical construct (for example, a self-concept dimension within ERBSE L) and the document meaningfully measures or discusses that media-related dimension. By contrast, texts that only mention media in passing (e.g., noting that survey results appear “in den Medien”) or use “Medien” as part of a name or aside without analyzing media behavior, access, or effects are non-relevant. Edge cases include documents centered on politics or education that are still relevant if they analyze media use or social media modules, and communications channels (landline/mobile/internet) counting as Medien; however, unrelated homographs like “Median” or generic “medium/mediocre” usages are not. Pretests or cognitive interview reports remain relevant if their items or stimuli focus on media access, use, or networks, even when detailed item-level results are not documented.
54808	berufsprestige	The user seeks information on occupational prestige in Germany, focusing on Wegener’s Magnitude Prestige Scale (MPS), its dependence on ISCO-68 coding, and the challenges of applying it to official data coded with the German KldB. They also want methods or references for reconstructing or mapping the MPS to KldB (e.g., Frietsch & Wirth 2001).	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses occupational prestige (Berufsprestige) in Germany, especially by discussing the Magnitude Prestigeskala (MPS) developed by Bernd Wegener, its reliance on ISCO‑68 coding, or efforts to map/reconstruct it for German classifications like the KldB (e.g., for the Mikrozensus). Content that details the methodological challenges of converting KldB to ISCO‑68, reports on reconstruction approaches (such as Frietsch & Wirth 2001), or uses MPS scores as an indicator of social status would also be clearly relevant. By contrast, pieces that only describe job classifications without any prestige measure, discuss “prestige” in a non-occupational or non-German context, or cover other prestige scales without linkage to MPS in Germany are not relevant. Edge cases include papers on international prestige scales (e.g., Treiman/SIOPS) or ISCO crosswalks that could be relevant if they tie back to German occupational prestige or MPS application, and studies on “soziale Lage” that matter only if occupational prestige is operationalized via MPS or a compatible measure.
54995	arbeitgeber	The user seeks details about employer-related questions in the PIAAC Longitudinal 2016 background questionnaire, including how information on employers and employment start was captured. They likely want to know what was asked and how these items were tested (e.g., via cognitive interviews).	A document is relevant to the query “arbeitgeber” (employer) if it explicitly mentions an employer or discusses employer-related details, such as questions about one’s employer, employment start date, employer policies, or employer characteristics (e.g., “Fragen … dem Arbeitgeber und dem Beschäftigungsbeginn” in a survey description). Documents using clear variants and compounds like “Arbeitgeberverband,” “Arbeitgeberanteil,” or regional synonyms such as “Dienstgeber” can also be relevant, as can English equivalents (“employer”) when the context is German employment. Content that focuses on employment or labor markets without referencing an employer (e.g., general skills assessments, methodology, or worker-only issues) is non-relevant. Edge cases include passing mentions where “Arbeitgeber” appears only once in a list (still marginally relevant), ambiguous abbreviations like “AG” (which can mean employer or Aktiengesellschaft), or related terms like “Firma/Betrieb” that imply an employer but don’t state it explicitly; these may be relevant depending on context.
55053	arbeit zufriedenheit	The user seeks information on job satisfaction, specifically German-language survey instruments that measure general work satisfaction and its facets (e.g., self-actualization, resignation, pay satisfaction, company evaluation) and related constructs like workload and organizational climate, including their structure and psychometric properties.	A document is relevant to the query “arbeit zufriedenheit” when it directly addresses job/work satisfaction, for example by presenting a scale or findings about general work satisfaction or dimensions such as self-actualization, resignation, satisfaction with pay, evaluation of the company, workplace climate, or perceived job characteristics like task variety, decision latitude, and psychological job demands. Content that explicitly measures “Zufriedenheit von Arbeit und Beruf” or “Allgemeine Arbeitszufriedenheit,” or links stress models to satisfaction at work, is clearly on-target. It may be only partly relevant if it treats broader satisfaction constructs (e.g., the Satisfaction with Life Scale) or domain satisfaction but explicitly ties them to the work domain; terms like “Zufriedenheit” alone are insufficient without a work context, though synonyms such as Jobzufriedenheit or Berufszufriedenheit count. Documents focused on unrelated satisfaction or traits—residential satisfaction, doctor-visit satisfaction, environmental norms, sensation seeking, health anxiety, or social desirability—are non-relevant unless they are analyzed as predictors or covariates of work satisfaction. Edge cases include measures of “Arbeitsorientierung” or “Betriebsklima,” which can be relevant if connected to or operationalized as components or determinants of work satisfaction.
55130	arbeitsbedingungen	The user seeks research-based information on working conditions, focusing on how they are measured in surveys (e.g., job satisfaction scales, ICT use and digital skills at work, psychosocial safety climate), including contexts involving older workers. They want details on instrument reliability/validity and pretesting methods.	A document is relevant if it directly describes, measures, or evaluates workplace conditions (Arbeitsbedingungen), including physical, organizational, and psychosocial aspects. Examples include survey modules on ICT at the workplace, questions about conditions in one’s last job, instruments like Psychosocial Safety Climate that assess management’s commitment to employees’ mental health, or job satisfaction scales with a specific “Meine Arbeitsbedingungen” subscale. Methodology or pretest reports can still be relevant when they contain items or insights about working conditions, even if framed around validation or focused on specific groups (e.g., ages 55–70). Non-relevant documents focus only on general ICT use in households, retirement and lifestyle without a link to work, or purely report psychometric reliabilities without substantive content about conditions at work. Edge cases include content on Arbeitszufriedenheit or digital skills learning that is relevant only when clearly tied to the work environment, and discussions of colleagues/supervisors or organizational climate that count when they frame the conditions under which work is performed.
55226	arbeitsbelastung	Find information on subjective workload in nursing as measured in the German BIBB/BAuA employee surveys, including the scale’s dimensions (coordination/information problems and psychophysical overload), its theoretical basis, and how it was pretested and validated.	A document is relevant if it directly discusses Arbeitsbelastung as workplace burden/workload, especially in nursing, and describes concrete dimensions such as coordination and information problems or psychophysical overload. Highly relevant examples include German occupational surveys (e.g., BIBB/BAuA Erwerbstätigenbefragung 2016/2018), scales grounded in motivation and stress theories, and instrument development or pretests using cognitive interviews that measure perceived workload and its health impacts. Content that addresses related terms like Arbeitsstress, Belastungen am Arbeitsplatz, task demands, or training/qualification in explicit relation to workload also fits. Non-relevant items are those where “Belastung” refers to unrelated domains (financial, legal, environmental, mechanical/computing load) or nursing texts that do not analyze or measure workload. Edge cases include job ads or policy statements that merely note “hohe Arbeitsbelastung” without definitions, dimensions, or findings (only marginally relevant), while studies in other occupations can still be relevant if they operationalize workload in comparable ways.
55428	arbeit	The user is seeking information on work-related constructs and measures in German surveys, particularly questionnaires assessing work orientation, general job satisfaction, and perceived job characteristics. They likely want details on the instruments used (e.g., in ALLBUS), their subscales, and theoretical foundations.	A document is relevant to the query “arbeit” if it discusses work or employment, such as job satisfaction, work orientation, occupational attitudes, or job characteristics, and it often contains compounds like Arbeitszufriedenheit, Arbeitsleben, or beruflicher Arbeit. The provided paragraph is relevant because it includes work-focused scales and constructs (e.g., Allgemeine Arbeitszufriedenheit, Arbeitsorientierung, Perzipierte Tätigkeitsmerkmale like Aufgabenvielfalt, Entscheidungsspielraum, psychische Jobanforderungen) and an instrument covering attitudes toward work and the workplace. By contrast, mentions of “Arbeiten” meaning “the works/publications of” (e.g., basiert auf den Arbeiten von Schwartz) or unrelated uses like Arbeitsspeicher (computer memory) or physical “work” in physics are non-relevant false positives. Edge cases include generic uses of the verb arbeiten (“to work on something”) without an employment context, domain-specific terms like Sozialarbeit or Hausarbeit, and surnames that look similar but are unrelated; however, phrases like beruflicher Arbeit or synonyms such as Beruf, Job, or Beschäftigung, and morphological variants (arbeiten, Arbeiter, Arbeits-) generally indicate relevance.
56202	arbeitsbelastungen	The user seeks information on occupational workloads (Arbeitsbelastungen), particularly in nursing, and how they are conceptualized and measured in German BIBB/BAuA employee surveys. They likely want the workload dimensions (e.g., coordination/information problems, psychophysical overload) and details of the survey/pretest methodology.	A document is relevant if it discusses work-related burdens (Arbeitsbelastungen) in a German context, especially topics like perceived workload, coordination and information problems, psychophysical overload, or job strain, and may reference surveys or scales (e.g., BIBB/BAuA Erwerbstätigenbefragung), their development from motivation/stress theory, or methods like cognitive interviews. Content focusing on specific sectors such as nursing, workplace demands, health impacts, or training/education related to managing workload also fits. Documents that use “Belastung” in non-work contexts (mechanical load, environmental load), or discuss employment broadly without addressing workload, are not relevant. Edge cases include texts that only mention the term in passing (e.g., in a keyword list) without substantive discussion, or materials about student homework load rather than occupational workload; synonyms like Arbeitsanforderungen, Beanspruchung, gesundheitliche Beeinträchtigungen, job strain, or workload in English can still indicate relevance.
57292	ausländer	The user is looking for German social survey resources on “Ausländer,” including standardized ALLBUS items and scales measuring attitudes toward foreigners (and related topics like antisemitism), plus standard variables for citizenship and work permits. They also seek documentation on instrument development and cognitive pretests, along with best practices for mixed-device and mobile survey implementation.	A document is relevant if it directly addresses Ausländer (foreigners) in Germany—for example, defining the term, describing integration, legal rights and status differences (citizenship, work permits, EU vs third-country nationals), or reporting survey items and results about attitudes toward Ausländer (e.g., ALLBUS scales). Content about standardized questionnaire items for citizenship and work authorization in German studies is relevant, as are discussions that analyze or pretest questions on “Ausländer” attitudes. Methodological texts (like mixed-device or mobile survey guidelines) are only relevant if they explicitly connect methods to measuring opinions or experiences of Ausländer; otherwise they are non-relevant. Mentions of closely related terms (ausländische Bevölkerung, Migranten/Zuwanderer, Unionsbürger, Drittstaatenangehörige) count, while references to other topics (e.g., antisemitism or “Juden”) are non-relevant unless directly linked to foreigners. Edge cases include documents that use “Ausländer” only in passing or outside the German context, which may be marginally relevant or not relevant depending on whether they provide substantive information about foreigners in Germany.
5736	wohlfahrtsstaat	The user seeks information on how public attitudes toward the welfare state are measured and studied, including an eight-item welfare-state scale, a left–right political orientation measure, and views on income inequality and redistribution. They may also want details about the PAWCER project’s cross-national research and its cognitive-interview pretests.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses the welfare state (Wohlfahrtsstaat/Sozialstaat), its functions or benefits, or public attitudes toward it. Content such as survey instruments (e.g., an eight-item scale of welfare-state attitudes), links to left–right political self-placement, opinions on income inequality and redistribution, cross-national projects like PAWCER, and methodological details (e.g., cognitive interviews) all strengthen relevance. Material about climate change or energy is only relevant if explicitly connected to welfare-state attitudes within the same research context. Non-relevant items include texts that merely name “Wohlfahrtsstaat” without analysis, use “Wohlfahrt” to mean charity or general well-being, or discuss unrelated “welfare” topics (e.g., animal or corporate welfare) or political scales without tying them to the welfare state. Edge cases: documents using the synonym “Sozialstaat,” in other languages but clearly about the welfare state, or comparative studies across countries are relevant, while purely ideological measures without redistribution or welfare-state linkage are borderline.
57703	arbeitsweg	The user is seeking information about “Arbeitsweg” (the commute to work), specifically the duration of the commute as addressed in the PIAAC Round 2 pretest, including how this is asked or measured in the survey.	A document is relevant if it directly addresses the commute to work (Arbeitsweg), such as the duration, distance, travel time, route, transportation mode, or costs—for example, survey content that explicitly includes “Dauer des Arbeitsweges,” as in this PIAAC pretest. Study or methodology descriptions are also relevant when they measure or analyze commuting behaviors or times, even if the primary topic is broader. Synonyms and variants like Pendeln, Weg zur Arbeit, Fahrt-/Wegezeit, Anfahrtsweg, Pendelstrecke, or plural forms (Arbeitswege) also indicate relevance. Non-relevant content would use “Arbeitsweg” metaphorically (e.g., career path), discuss work methods (“Weg der Arbeit”), or focus on unrelated topics (e.g., team work) without a clear link to commuting; legal discussions of accidents on the way to work are borderline and only relevant if they analyze the commute itself. Here, the paragraph is relevant because it specifies survey questions about the duration of the commute.
5830	politisches wissen	The user seeks validated instruments and survey modules for measuring political knowledge and closely related socio-political constructs (e.g., efficacy, cynicism, conservatism) in German/European contexts. They want references and validation/pretest details for short scales and datasets such as PEKS, KPZ, SECS-GER, CSES, and related measures used in major panels.	A document is relevant to the query “politisches Wissen” when it defines, measures, or analyzes citizens’ factual political knowledge—for example, quiz-style items about institutions, parties, policies, or the ability to correctly identify political actors—and when it presents validated instruments or datasets that include explicit political knowledge variables. Instruments that primarily assess attitudes or dispositions (e.g., political cynicism KPZ, conservatism SECS-GER, asylum-policy attitudes), perceived influence or self-efficacy (PEKS), or general/crystallized knowledge unrelated to politics (BEFKI GC-K) are non-relevant. Topic modules like CSES are relevant only if they contain knowledge test items; the described Module 5 pretest focuses on interest and attitudes (elites, immigration, redistribution) and thus is less relevant. Edge cases include studies on panel conditioning if they document effects on political knowledge responses, environmental “knowledge” scales that become relevant only when they test knowledge of political institutions/policies rather than physical ecology, and projects on inflation expectations that are relevant only if they measure understanding of monetary policy. Mentions of “politische Kompetenz” are relevant when operationalized as factual knowledge rather than self-assessed efficacy.
5843	populism	The user is seeking methodological resources and survey measures to study populism and related attitudes (e.g., political cynicism, satisfaction with the political system, nationalism/authoritarianism). They want guidance on sampling (probability vs non-probability), constructing derived variables in German datasets (ALLBUS/Microcensus), and applying Blossfeld’s occupational classification.	A document is relevant to the query “populism” when it explicitly analyzes populist ideology, attitudes, parties, leaders, or outcomes—e.g., discussions of anti-elite rhetoric, people-centrism, Manichean “people vs. corrupt elites” frames, measurement of populist attitudes (such as Akkerman et al.’s scales), or voting for populist parties like AfD, Fidesz, or Podemos. It can also be relevant if constructs like political cynicism, nationalism, or attitudes toward out-groups (e.g., Islam) are directly linked to explaining or measuring populism. By contrast, material focused on general sampling theory, survey-mode guidance, occupational classifications, or generic psychometric scales (optimism, trust, locus of control, political system satisfaction) without tying them to populism is non-relevant. The provided paragraph mainly covers survey methodology and diverse attitude scales (e.g., SPS, KPZ, nationalism, attitudes to Islam) without framing them as measures or determinants of populism, so it is at best tangential. Edge cases include studies that never use the word “populism” but operationalize anti-elite sentiment or people-centrism as outcomes, which would be relevant, and methods papers that are only relevant if they are applied to sampling or measuring populist publics specifically.
58596	gesundheit arbeit	The user is seeking German research instruments and surveys related to work and health, including validated scales for work addiction, psychosocial safety climate, and organizational climate, along with measures of health behaviors. They want resources (e.g., from RKI, FReDA, GIP, STEP) detailing questionnaire items, pretests, and validation for assessing employee mental/physical health, work conditions, and preventive behaviors.	A document is most relevant if it explicitly links health (Gesundheit) with work (Arbeit), especially in occupational or organizational contexts, such as employee mental health, working conditions, or workplace climate. Clear matches include instruments and studies on work addiction, Psychosocial Safety Climate (protecting employees’ psychological health), the BOKX relating workplace meaningfulness/competence to well-being, and STEP items on last-job conditions and health in older workers. It can be partially relevant if it covers health and work adjacent topics without a direct workplace link—for example, a reforms survey that jointly addresses labor market and health policy, or skin cancer screening when tied to occupational exposure. Documents are not relevant if they discuss health without a work nexus (e.g., children’s physical activity, active transport without commuting-to-work framing, satisfaction with a doctor visit, or LoneCovid social networks) or work without health (e.g., job values or procrastination scales unless explicitly occupational-health related). Edge cases include terms where “Gesundheit” appears only as an institution’s name or “Arbeit” is generic (e.g., “Arbeitsorientierung”) without health implications—these should be treated as non-relevant unless the content clearly connects work and health.
59281	geschlechterrolle	The user seeks information on survey research about gender roles, specifically the ISSP “Family and Gender Roles” module and its pretesting. They want details on how neighborhood social openness, control, and discrimination are measured and linked to egalitarian gender role attitudes in German panel studies.	A document is relevant if it substantively discusses gender roles (Geschlechterrollen), gender norms, or gender equality, including research or surveys that measure attitudes toward traditional vs. egalitarian roles in family, work, or society. Examples include ISSP modules on “Family and Gender Roles,” questionnaires about gender justice, division of household labor and caregiving, or studies on how neighborhood openness and social control influence egalitarian gender attitudes. Methodological descriptions (e.g., cognitive interviews, web probing) are relevant when they explicitly test items about gender roles; if they only describe methods without gender-content, relevance is limited. A document is non-relevant if “Rolle” refers to unrelated meanings (theater roles, mechanical rollers) or if it focuses on social openness/control or discrimination without linking these to gender roles. Edge cases include work on pluralism, integration, or attitudes toward outgroups that is relevant only when it connects those themes to gender equality or gender role attitudes; synonyms like Rollenbilder, Gendernormen, or gender roles in English also qualify.
59288	geschlechterrollen	The user is looking for information on ISSP 2022 and the “Leben im Viertel” panel pretests for the Family and Gender Roles module, including newly developed survey items and their cognitive testing (phone/video interviews, web probing). They want to understand how neighborhood social openness, control, and discrimination influence egalitarian attitudes toward gender roles and pluralism in German cities.	A document is relevant to the query “geschlechterrollen” if it directly discusses gender roles, gender equality, or attitudes toward the division of roles in family, work, or society, including survey-based measurements of such views. The provided paragraph is relevant because it explicitly references the ISSP module “Familie und Geschlechterrollen,” tests items on gender equality and egalitarian attitudes, and examines how neighborhood social openness and control shape views on gender roles. Methodological content (cognitive interviews, web probing) remains relevant when it is used to develop or validate questions about gender roles; if it only describes survey logistics without substantive connection to gender-role content, relevance is weak. Documents focused on social openness, control, or discrimination that never tie these to gender roles, or that use “Rollen” in unrelated senses (e.g., theater roles, industrial rollers) or “Geschlecht” as purely biological/grammatical categories, are non-relevant. Edge cases include studies on immigrant integration or neighborhood dynamics that mention gender equality only tangentially (partial relevance) versus research on family policy, household labor division, or stereotypes explicitly framed as gender roles (clearly relevant).
6086	refugee	The user is seeking research on how to measure refugees’ social integration and well-being. They want validated multilingual tools (German, Arabic, Dari) for assessing sense of belonging, everyday discrimination, and health (SF-12), with evidence of reliability and measurement invariance in refugee samples in Germany.	A document is relevant to the query “refugee” when refugees are the focal population or analytical lens—e.g., studies validating a Challenged Sense of Belonging Scale on thousands of adult refugees in Germany or adapting discrimination and health surveys (EDS, SF-12) for Arabic, Farsi/Dari, and German-speaking refugees. Methodological papers are still relevant if the instruments are developed, adapted, or tested specifically in refugee samples, or if they address refugee integration, belonging, discrimination, or health outcomes. By contrast, work on general immigrants or the “German-speaking population” without a clearly identified refugee subsample, or psychometric validations that never engage refugee status, would be non-relevant. Edge cases include studies on people with a “migration background” that mix migrants and refugees (partially relevant), papers focusing on closely related groups like asylum seekers or displaced persons (often relevant), and documents that only mention refugees in passing without empirical or conceptual focus (likely non-relevant).
60915	führungskräfte	The user seeks validated German questionnaires to assess leader–employee communication and leader–member exchange (e.g., LMX-MDM, LMX-7, SymCom Check) and feedback instruments for evaluating firefighter/rescue leadership training (FIRE modules), including their subscales, factor structure, reliability, and validity.	A document is relevant if it explicitly focuses on Führungskräfte (leaders/executives) and their behavior, communication, relationships with employees, or training/evaluation, especially in German contexts. Clear signals include discussion of leadership communication from employees’ perspective, Leader–Member Exchange (e.g., LMX/LMX7 with facets like Affection, Loyalty, Professional Respect, Perceived Contribution), the SymCom Check for symmetric internal communication, or evaluation tools for leadership training in emergency services (FIRE PL/E/G/DO/EV/ST/CU) with psychometric evidence. It is also relevant if it reports validation details (factor structure, internal consistency, construct/criterion validity) of scales used to assess leadership or leader training outcomes. Non-relevant items include uses of “Führung” or “Kräfte” in unrelated meanings (e.g., steering, physical forces), generic firefighter training without a leadership focus, or workplace communication content that omits leaders. Edge cases: singular Führungskraft, synonyms like Vorgesetzte/r, Leitung, or Management count; English-only leadership constructs can be relevant if they pertain to leader–employee dynamics, whereas purely peer-to-peer communication or rescue exercises without leader evaluation would not.
6092	refugees	The user is seeking research on measuring refugees’ social integration and wellbeing, focusing on validated multilingual (German/Arabic/Dari) instruments—such as a Challenged Sense of Belonging Scale, the Everyday Discrimination Scale, and the SF-12—with evidence of reliability, validity, and measurement invariance in refugee samples in Germany.	A document is relevant to the query “refugees” when it centers on refugee populations, their experiences, measurement tools validated in refugee samples, or policies/services affecting them. This paragraph is clearly relevant: it describes scales for sense of belonging, discrimination, and health (SF-12) that were adapted, pretested, and validated specifically with large multilingual samples of adult refugees in Germany (e.g., English, Arabic, Farsi/Dari speakers), and reports psychometric results like CFA and measurement invariance for those groups. Content that only discusses social integration or health in the general population without explicitly including refugees, or that mentions “refugees” only in passing or as a metaphor, would be non-relevant. Edge cases include studies on “individuals with a migration background” or Arabic/Dari speakers where refugees are part of a mixed sample; these can still be relevant if refugees are a defined subgroup or the tools are intended for refugee assessment, but less so if refugees cannot be distinguished from other migrants.
61220	führungskraft	The user seeks German-language, validated tools to assess leadership and leader–member communication (e.g., LMX7, LMX-MDM, SymCom) and to evaluate training for rescue-service leaders (FIRE modules), including their subscales, factor structures, and psychometric validity.	A document is relevant if it focuses on the role or behavior of a Führungskraft (manager/leader) in organizations, such as measuring leader–employee communication or relationships (e.g., LMX7/LMX-MDM, communication quality scales, SymCom for symmetric internal communication). Content evaluating or developing training for Führungskräfte, especially in the rescue services context (e.g., FIRE instruments for plan/einsatz exercises, group work, instructors, self-directed tasks, seminars, or the Führungsstab), is also clearly relevant. It can still be relevant even if “Führungskraft” appears in plural or via close synonyms (e.g., Vorgesetzte, Führungsperson) or if the leader–member concept is referenced using English terms (Leader–Member Exchange). Non-relevant documents would discuss “Führung” in unrelated senses (guided tours, criminal records/Führungszeugnis) or general communication/training not tied to leaders or leadership roles; borderline cases include purely psychometric discussions with no explicit link to leadership contexts.
61312	führung	The user is looking for information on leadership assessment, specifically the German Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) that measures transformational leadership, its origins in Bass & Avolio (1995), and its withdrawn status.	A document is relevant if it uses “Führung” in the leadership/management sense, especially in organizational psychology contexts (e.g., transformational leadership) and may reference tools like the German Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) or scholars such as Bass and Avolio; for example, a German description of the MLQ’s development based on Bass & Avolio (1995), even noting that version as withdrawn, is highly relevant. It is non-relevant if “Führung” refers to unrelated meanings such as a guided tour (“Museumsführung”), mechanical guides/rails (“Führungsschiene”), or administrative terms like “Führungszeugnis.” Edge cases include compound forms and orthographic variants such as “Führungskraft,” “Führungsverhalten,” or “Fuehrung,” which should still count as relevant, whereas a page that only lists the term in a bibliography or navigation menu without substantive discussion is weakly relevant. Documents in English that discuss “leadership” without the German keyword may be conceptually relevant but may not match a strict keyword query, while retraction notices that analyze why an MLQ version was withdrawn can still be relevant due to their focus on leadership measurement.
61531	geschlecht und geschlechterrollen	The user seeks studies and survey instruments on how gender and gender roles are conceptualized and measured—especially in German social research (e.g., ISSP modules, demographic standards, cognitive pretests). They also want findings on egalitarian gender-role attitudes and the validity or invariance of related scales across groups.	A document is relevant to “geschlecht und geschlechterrollen” if it directly discusses the concept and measurement of Geschlecht (e.g., male/female/diverse, biological vs legal vs identity) and examines attitudes, norms, or egalitarianism regarding Geschlechterrollen, such as the ISSP “Family and Gender Roles” module or studies linking neighborhood openness/control to gender‑role attitudes. Material that debates how to capture gender identity in surveys or presents the status quo of recording sex is relevant for the “Geschlecht” part, and becomes fully relevant when connected to role expectations or policy implications. By contrast, studies that merely use Geschlecht as a control variable or report measurement invariance across gender for unrelated constructs (gratitude scales, curiosity inventories, attractiveness ratings) are non‑relevant or only tangential. Methodological notes on survey modes or panel design without substantive analysis of gender or roles are non‑relevant. Edge cases include analyses of nonmarital unions or same‑ vs different‑sex pair classification, which are only relevant if they address role distributions, division of labor, or role norms within partnerships.
61686	gender role attitudes	The user wants information on how gender role attitudes are defined, measured, and tracked in surveys, including key dimensions (ideology, consequences, economic), related constructs (work–family conflict, ambivalent sexism), and commonly used instruments (e.g., ISSP). They may also seek evidence of changes over time and guidance on operationalizing sex/gender in survey research.	A document is relevant if it directly examines gender role attitudes—normative beliefs about appropriate behavior for women and men—and describes how these attitudes are conceptualized or measured. Clear signals include discussions of established scales or dimensions (e.g., gender role ideology, consequence and economic consequence dimensions, ISSP Family and Changing Gender Roles items), work–family conflict framed by gender, or ambivalent sexism toward men (hostility/benevolence with components like paternalism, maternalism, gender differentiation, and heterosexuality). Methodological pieces can also be relevant when they address how sex/gender is recorded, distinguish sex from gender identity, or test measurement invariance that affects interpreting gender role attitudes. By contrast, content on unrelated constructs (need for cognition, patriotism/authority, welfare state attitudes, workplace mobbing, interviewer training, or general epistemology) is non-relevant unless it explicitly links those constructs to gender role attitudes. Edge cases include studies that merely control for gender or discuss “roles” (e.g., workplace role conflicts) without a gendered attitudinal focus—these are typically non-relevant—whereas cohort/age analyses are relevant only when they explain variation in gender role attitudes.
61734	gender role	Find an overview of gender role orientations/attitudes and how they are measured in surveys, including key dimensions and instruments (e.g., ISSP Family and Changing Gender Roles). Also seek current practices for recording sex versus gender in questionnaires and evidence on changes in gender role attitudes over time.	A document is relevant to the query “gender role” when it defines or examines gender role orientations/ideology, normative expectations for men and women, changes in these attitudes over time, or presents instruments that measure gender role attitudes. Examples from the paragraph that are clearly relevant include the ISSP Family and Changing Gender Roles items (consequence, ideology, and economic dimensions), the discussion on recording sex vs. gender identity in surveys, and scales capturing ambivalent sexism toward men (paternalism/maternalism, gender differentiation, heterosexuality). Content is only partially relevant when “gender” appears merely as a demographic control or invariance check without engaging gender role norms (e.g., LWMS or curiosity/empathy scales reporting invariance by gender, AR1 controlling for evaluator gender). Non-relevant material includes general survey methodology (interviewer recruitment/training, open-ended question analysis) and unrelated psychometric scales (need for cognition, workplace mobbing, team performance, study satisfaction) unless explicitly tied to gender role ideologies. Edge cases include uses of “role” that are not about gender (e.g., workplace role conflicts or role-play evaluations); these remain non-relevant unless they explicitly analyze those conflicts through gendered expectations such as work–family interference framed by gender role ideology.
61761	gender roles	The user seeks information on how gender role attitudes are defined and measured in social surveys, including key scales (e.g., ISSP), their dimensions (ideology, consequences, economic), evidence of change over time, and current practices for recording sex versus gender identity.	A document is relevant if it explicitly examines gender roles as normative expectations for how men and women should behave, measures gender role attitudes, or tracks changes in these attitudes over time (e.g., ISSP’s Family and Changing Gender Roles module or dimensions like Consequence, Gender Role Ideology, and Economic Consequences). Studies debating how to record sex versus gender identity can be relevant when tied to understanding or measuring role attitudes and their societal implications. Content focused only on general survey methods, interviewer training, or unrelated psychometric scales (e.g., empathy, need for cognition, workplace mobbing) is not relevant unless it directly links those constructs to beliefs about appropriate male/female roles. Edge cases include measures of ambivalent sexism toward men or work–family conflict scales, which can be relevant when framed as consequences or manifestations of gender role ideology, whereas mere mentions of “gender” as a demographic control or measurement invariance across gender are insufficient.
6177	erziehung	The user seeks information on Erziehung (child-rearing/education), focusing on key dimensions of parenting and family socialization, and how these are assessed in educational research (e.g., teacher self-concepts) and situated within classification frameworks like ISCED.	A document is relevant to the query “erziehung” when it substantively discusses upbringing or education, such as parental child-rearing practices, religious socialization, or educational processes in early childhood and schooling. This paragraph is clearly relevant because it covers dimensions of parental Erziehungsverhalten (e.g., loving support and religious upbringing), poses questions about the Erziehung of children in family studies, and references ISCED’s coverage of vorschulische Erziehung. Content about the ERBSE-L instrument is relevant if it addresses the “Erziehung” subscale of teacher self-concepts, but would be less relevant if it only treated other subscales (e.g., Media or Diagnostics) without touching upbringing/education. ISCED material is relevant when it frames Erziehung within organized learning pathways; purely technical classification details without any link to upbringing or educational practice would be borderline. Edge cases include compounds and inflections (Erziehungsverhalten, erzieherisch), which count as matches, whereas passing mentions in citations or acronyms without explanatory context would be weakly relevant.
6213	religionszugehörigkeit	The user is seeking information on how religious affiliation is measured in standardized social science surveys in Germany, including the design and cognitive pretesting of questions and their translations. Context includes related items on COVID-19 and household income and their use in a study of Islamist attitudes among Muslim youth.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses Religionszugehörigkeit (religious affiliation) as a measured variable, question item, or data field—for example, survey instruments, pretests, or datasets that include questions on respondents’ denominational belonging, wording, translations, or coding. The provided paragraph is relevant because it states that pretested items include Religionszugehörigkeit, describes cognitive interviews around those items, and notes translations (e.g., Turkish and Arabic) and related constructs like identification with religion. Non-relevant documents would discuss religion in general (theology, religious freedom, Islamist attitudes) without asking or reporting affiliation, or only mention the term in passing without operational content. Edge cases include synonyms or variants such as Konfession, Glaubenszugehörigkeit, religious denomination/belonging in English, hyphenation or plural forms, mentions confined to variable lists or metadata, and legal/privacy discussions that reference religious affiliation but provide no measurement or data. Even if Religionszugehörigkeit appears alongside other topics (e.g., pandemic or household income) in a survey context, it remains relevant; mere thematic overlap with “religion” without affiliation does not.
62289	generation y	The user likely wants a concise definition of Generation Y (Millennials), including their birth-year range and core characteristics. They may also seek research-based insights into this cohort’s attitudes, values, and behaviors, possibly in comparison with other generations.	A document is relevant to the query “generation y” if it explicitly discusses the Millennial cohort—using terms like “Generation Y,” “Gen Y,” or “Millennials”—or analyzes people born roughly 1981–1996 (with stated birth-year ranges), including their attitudes, behaviors, demographics, or comparisons to Gen X/Gen Z. It also counts if a study’s sampling, results, or interventions are targeted specifically at this cohort (e.g., workplace preferences of Millennials or survey findings segmented by Millennial birth years). By contrast, documents that use “generation” generically (e.g., intergenerational fairness), discuss “young people” without defining the Generation Y birth cohort, or focus on survey methods and general scales—as in interviewer training or broad population instruments—are non-relevant. Edge cases include mentions of “generation” in unrelated contexts (power generation, variable “y,” genetics) or materials in other languages that still clearly denote “Generation Y/Millennials,” which can be relevant if the cohort is unambiguously identified. A piece that includes many general scales but lacks a cohort-specific analysis is non-relevant, whereas a document that segments results by birth years aligning with Millennials is potentially relevant even if it doesn’t use the term “Generation Y.”
62491	generation	The user seeks social survey resources related to “generation,” such as instruments measuring intergenerational fairness and name-generator questions used in egocentric network studies.	A document is most relevant to the query “generation” when it centrally discusses generations (age cohorts), the act of generating something (e.g., generating data, names, or content), or process-oriented “generation” such as energy generation. In this paragraph, there are weak matches: “intergenerational social support” aligns with the cohort sense, and the social network section where respondents “generate names” aligns with the verb sense; these are relevant only if the user’s intent includes those meanings. Most of the text focuses on interviewer training and various social science scales, so incidental appearances do not make it strongly relevant; words like “General” in survey names are false positives. Edge cases include brief, isolated mentions (e.g., a single item on intergenerational fairness) or uses embedded in proper nouns, which should be treated as low relevance unless the query is intentionally broad. If the user intended technical senses like text generation or electricity generation, this document would be non-relevant despite the lexical overlaps.
6322	klima	The user is seeking information on psychological “climate” measures, specifically a short-form Family Climate scale for adolescents and the BOKX Vocational and Organizational Climate Index. They want to know the dimensions these tools assess (e.g., positive emotional climate, leisure, organization, control, intellectual-cultural orientation; meaningfulness and competence) and their use as brief screening instruments for well-being and performance.	A document is relevant to the query “klima” if it discusses “Klima” in German, including social/organizational contexts (e.g., Familienklima, Betriebsklima) as well as meteorological climate. The given paragraph is relevant because it explicitly treats Familienklima via subscales (positive-emotional climate, control, organization, etc.) and introduces an Organisations-/Berufs-Klima-Index (BOKX) measuring perceived meaning and competence. Terms like “Familienklimaskalen,” “Organisationsklima,” and “Klimaindex” should count as matches since German compounds and hyphenations contain the “Klima” stem, and matching should be case-insensitive. Non-relevant content would include occurrences where “Klima” appears in unrelated compounds (e.g., Klimaanlage/air conditioner) or where BOKX is discussed purely as a wellbeing or performance tool without any climate framing. Edge cases include documents using synonyms without the exact token (e.g., “soziales Klima,” “Betriebsklima”), which are topically relevant, and meteorological pieces (e.g., Klimawandel) that match the keyword but are thematically less aligned with this paragraph’s focus on family/organizational climate.
63419	islam	The user is seeking details about a survey scale that measures attitudes toward Islam in Germany, specifically the instrument used in the 2012 ALLBUS study. They likely want its purpose, items/methodology, and key findings or availability.	A document is relevant to the query “islam” if it substantively discusses Islam as a religion, culture, or social phenomenon—covering beliefs, practices, history, demographics, Muslim communities, or societal attitudes toward Islam. For example, the paragraph describing a scale that measures attitudes toward Islam in Germany and its use in the ALLBUS 2012 survey is clearly relevant because it directly analyzes perceptions of Islam. Documents using related terms like “Islamic” or “Muslim” in meaningful contexts (e.g., Islamic law, Islamic art, Muslim populations in Europe) are also relevant. Non-relevant cases include uses of “Islam” as a personal surname, place names like “Islamabad,” or brief, incidental mentions where Islam is not the subject. Edge cases include articles on groups like “Islamic State” or security topics that use the term “Islamic” but focus solely on geopolitics or militancy without discussing Islam itself, which may be only tangentially relevant.
6370	klimawandel	The user is seeking documentation on climate change-related survey questions and their pretesting within German social research panels (PAWCER, FReDA W6a, FGZ cohesion panel). They want details on associated topics (e.g., fertility, inequality, gender equality, antisemitism) and the testing methods used (cognitive interviews, web probing).	A document is relevant to the query “klimawandel” when it substantively discusses climate change—its attitudes, impacts, policies, or measurement—such as project descriptions or survey modules focused on climate change and energy. For example, descriptions of PAWCER’s work on welfare-state attitudes alongside climate change/energy, FReDA W6a items on climate change and fertility, or FGZ panel questions about climate change all clearly qualify. Content that centers on other topics (e.g., antisemitism, gender equality, left–right scales, or income redistribution) and only mentions climate change in passing is only weakly relevant. Methodological reports (cognitive interviews, web probing) that reference “Klimawandel” merely as labels for test items may match the keyword but be less useful to users seeking substantive findings. Edge cases include documents using synonyms like “Klimakrise” or “Erderwärmung” or related domains like energy policy (topically relevant but may not match a strict keyword), and uses of “Klima” to mean social climate or branding, which are non-relevant.
6481	home office	The user likely wants guidance on setting up and managing a home office for remote work, including workspace design, essential equipment, ergonomics, productivity practices, and any relevant workplace or tax policies.	A document is relevant to the query “home office” if it substantively addresses working from home or a home-based workspace—e.g., telework policies, ergonomics and equipment, productivity practices, tax/legal issues, or statistics on remote work prevalence—and, in an alternate sense, if it pertains to the UK Home Office as a governmental body. The provided paragraph concentrates on German Microcensus methods, cohabiting unions, the EGP class scheme, and psychometric scales, none of which discuss home-based work arrangements or the UK ministry. Mentions of “office workers” or “Access to Home Familiarity” are incidental and relate to measurement scales, not to home-office setups or remote work practices, so they don’t satisfy the query. Edge cases that would count include a survey methodology paper specifically measuring home-office use or telework in the Microcensus, or a policy analysis from the UK Home Office; merely containing the words “home” and “office” separately is not sufficient.
6499	politische bildung	The user seeks academic resources and validated survey instruments on political education and youths’ self-efficacy in school and political contexts. They want guidance on conceptualization, measurement, and coding of education and socio-political attitudes, plus references to cross-national surveys and short scales with evidence from cognitive pretests and validations.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses civic or political education (politische Bildung), such as curricula, pedagogy, learning objectives (e.g., political literacy, democratic values, participation), program providers (e.g., bpb), or evaluations of educational interventions—especially in school, youth work, or adult education. Studies that use measurement tools like political efficacy scales (e.g., PEKS) are relevant when they assess learning outcomes in an educational setting, but not when they are used in general population surveys without a teaching/learning component. Documents focused on general educational attainment or classification (e.g., ISCED), education policy (Bildungspolitik), electoral behavior panels, or political attitude scales (e.g., KPZ) are non-relevant unless they are directly tied to civic education aims or pedagogy. Edge cases include research on political socialization or self-efficacy among youth, which is relevant only if situated in educational contexts, and training for politicians or party academies, which is typically non-relevant unless framed as citizen-oriented civic education. Content may be in German or other languages; works on “citizenship education” in other countries are also relevant if they address the same civic education goals and methods.
6534	kriminalitätsfurcht	The user seeks information on how the EU AUDITS project measures “fear of crime” and related perceptions of safety—via citizen surveys and a cognitive online pretest using web probing—to inform local security and prevention policy.	A document is relevant to the query “kriminalitätsfurcht” (fear of crime) when it explicitly discusses citizens’ fear of crime or perceived safety, especially in contexts like surveys, methodological tools, or policy design—as this text does by describing an EU project that pretests questions on fear of crime and subjective security in municipalities using web probing. Materials that detail measurement instruments (e.g., questionnaires on perceived safety), analytical approaches, or findings about fear of crime, including related constructs like “subjektives Sicherheitsempfinden” or “perceived safety,” are also relevant. By contrast, content focusing only on traffic safety, general security policy, or “audits” in unrelated domains (e.g., financial or IT security audits) without addressing fear of crime would be non-relevant. Edge cases include documents that mention kriminalitätsfurcht only in passing within a broader safety framework, which may be marginally relevant, and pieces that use synonyms (e.g., fear of victimization) or are in German/English but clearly analyze the construct, which should still be considered relevant.
65758	hochschule	The user seeks information on higher-education (Hochschule) resources, particularly university-affiliated research projects and validated measurement instruments for assessing digital readiness, study demands, dropout risk, and training quality. They want tools applicable to students, educators, and related professional training programs in German-speaking institutions.	This paragraph is highly relevant to the query “hochschule” because it repeatedly references higher education settings and institutions, including explicit mentions of Hochschulen and named entities like Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hochschule der Sächsischen Polizei, and the Duale Hochschule Baden-Württemberg (DHBW). It describes instruments and studies conducted in university contexts, such as the IDR‑24 for teachers and learners at Hochschulen, a study-requirements scale validated across four Hochschulen, and a dropout-risk measure for dual-study students at DHBW. Even sections on hand hygiene and internet-enabled pharmaceutical crime remain relevant because they are framed as projects run by Hochschulen or in cooperation with universities. An edge case is the firefighter training instrument, which is less directly academic but still touches higher education via scales adapted from Lehrevaluation an Hochschulen. A document would be non-relevant if it discussed only general schools, hospitals, or public safety without any link to Hochschulen, or if it mentioned only “Universität” and an exact-match search required the keyword “Hochschule.”
6616	politische partizipation	The user seeks surveys, scales, and pretested questionnaire items that measure political participation and related attitudes (e.g., efficacy, cynicism, engagement), along with methodological details. They want German/European sources such as ALLBUS, ESS, and CSES, including question wording, validation, and cognitive pretest results.	A document is relevant to the query “politische partizipation” if it directly measures, analyzes, or describes citizens’ participatory behaviors or capacities (e.g., voting, campaigning, political engagement, or political efficacy as a precursor to participation). Clear positives here include ALLBUS waves when the theme is Political Participation, the DDR project on political engagement, SOWI instruments that include Politisches Engagement, the Trier scales that cover political and environmental engagement, PEKS (political efficacy), RISS items on efficacy for political life, and CSES content when it includes turnout or contact behavior. Materials focused mainly on attitudes (immigration, antisemitism, national pride, conservatism, political cynicism) are only relevant if they explicitly link those attitudes to participation outcomes; otherwise they are non-relevant. Methodological pretests are relevant only when the pretested items concern participation (not, for example, purely asylum, climate, or gender-equality attitudes), and broad surveys like ESS/ALLBUS count only for modules that actually cover participation. Edge cases include “Digitale Partizipation” within the IDR 24 (likely about participation in digital learning, not political participation) and projects on inflation expectations or social networks during COVID, which are non-relevant unless they measure political engagement behaviors.
66195	environmental	The user seeks an overview of environmental psychology measurement scales—especially environmental efficacy—detailing what they assess (awareness, norms, coping styles, behaviors), their structure, and psychometric quality. They also want information on cross-cultural reliability and measurement invariance (e.g., ISSP 2020) to identify validated tools for assessing pro-environmental attitudes and behavior.	A document is relevant to the query “environmental” when it substantively discusses environmental topics such as ecological impacts, pro-environmental behavior, environmental attitudes or efficacy, chemical exposures, policies, or tools for measuring these constructs. For example, texts detailing pro-environmental efficacy, ISSP environmental modules, scales of environmental awareness and coping styles, littering norms, or psychometric results (e.g., reliabilities, cross-cultural invariance) are clearly on-topic. It is non-relevant if “environmental” appears only in unrelated contexts—like computer “environment variables,” software “test environments,” or generic “work environment” discussions—without ecological content. Edge cases that should still count as relevant include methodological or clinical pieces (e.g., measurement invariance analyses of environmental attitudes, or idiopathic environmental intolerance linked to environmental chemicals) because the focal constructs are environmental. Conversely, occurrences limited to organization names, citations, or boilerplate with no substantive environmental discussion should be considered non-relevant.
6719	welfare	The user is looking for research on measuring attitudes toward the welfare state and distribution principles (performance, need, equality) across social contexts, including details on a validated questionnaire’s factor structure, reliability, validity, and related personality correlates.	A document is relevant if it discusses the welfare state, public assistance or social services, or empirically examines attitudes toward welfare policies and distribution principles such as need, equality, and merit. Studies that validate scales measuring welfare attitudes (e.g., factor analyses, correlations with empathy or belief in a just world) or compare views across social contexts like work, welfare, and friendship are strongly relevant, even if they focus on measurement rather than program details. Content about policy debates, welfare reform, benefit eligibility, or public perceptions of welfare recipients also counts, including synonyms like social assistance, safety net, means-tested benefits, or programs like TANF. Non-relevant items use “welfare” to mean general well-being, animal welfare, player/employee welfare, or child welfare unrelated to state benefits, or purely theoretical “welfare economics” without linkage to social policy. Edge cases include “corporate welfare” (often relevant if tied to state subsidies) and historical or cross-national discussions that don’t say “welfare” explicitly but clearly address welfare-state services.
67689	family	The user seeks resources on how “family” is operationalized and analyzed in social surveys—especially the German Microcensus and ISSP—including reconstruction of derived household/family and living-arrangement variables in SPSS/STATA. They also want information on family-related psychometric scales (e.g., work–family conflict, family climate, parental upbringing, justice in the family) and related constructs such as educational aspirations and cultural capital.	A document is relevant if it substantively examines family as a social unit or construct—e.g., measures of work–family conflict, family climate, parenting/religiosity, educational aspirations shaped by families of origin, or microcensus-derived variables that define households, families, and living arrangements and show how to reconstruct them (SPSS/STATA). Content that operationalizes or analyzes family-level variables (such as “Family and Changing Gender Roles” modules or scales on justice in the family) is directly on point, as are studies using family-of-origin information (e.g., books in the family home) to explain outcomes. Material in German using “Familie” and “Haushalt” is also relevant when it enables family-level analysis, with “household” counting when it is explicitly tied to family relationships or life-forms. By contrast, pieces that only mention family in passing (e.g., national pride stabilizing family structures) or use “family” metaphorically (“family of products,” “family name”) are non-relevant. Edge cases include datasets focused on labor market or general households: they are relevant only if they provide identifiers or variables that reconstruct or analyze family units, otherwise they are borderline.
6854	natur	The user seeks information on how “nature” is conceptualized and measured in environmental attitude research, especially within the General Environmental Awareness scale. They want the distinctions between intrinsic and instrumental understandings of nature and “nature as a basis of existence,” and how these subscales are operationalized.	This document is largely relevant to the query “natur” because it explicitly discusses environmental worldview, with subscales like intrinsic and instrumental “Naturverständnis” and “Natur als Existenzgrundlage.” It also contains other uses of “Natur,” such as “menschliche Natur” (human nature) and in “Naturwissenschaften” (natural sciences), which match the keyword but may be tangential if the intent is specifically environmental nature. The mention of “Nature Human Behaviour” refers to the journal title and is only relevant if the query targets the publication “Nature,” otherwise it is a false positive. Content on Machiavellianism, conservatism, and the crystalline intelligence short scale is generally non-relevant unless the user seeks links between these constructs and concepts of nature. Edge cases include substring and case-insensitive matches (e.g., “natur” hitting “Natur,” “Nature,” or compounds), and the German-language context may or may not fit an English “nature” intent.
729	trust	The user seeks validated survey instruments to measure interpersonal and social trust, including short scales (e.g., ESS Social Trust Scale, KUSIV3), their items, administration, psychometric properties, and cross-national comparability. They may also want how transparency dimensions are measured and relate to trust.	A document is relevant to the query “trust” when it directly defines, measures, or analyzes interpersonal or social trust, such as descriptions of validated scales (e.g., the ESS Social Trust Scale or the Interpersonal Trust Short Scale/KUSIV3), their psychometric properties, and cross-national comparability (e.g., metric invariance between the UK and Germany). Content tying trust to related constructs and outcomes—like how transparency dimensions (disclosure, clarity, accuracy, timeliness, relevance) relate to trustworthiness, trust, and job satisfaction—or detailing applications in organizational relationships (employee–superior trust) is also relevant. Technical details that support the measurement of trust (translation methods like TRAPD, item wording, completion time, reliability coefficients) remain relevant if they pertain to assessing trust. By contrast, documents about “trust” in unrelated senses (legal financial trusts, brand names, “antitrust” law, cryptographic trust stores) or about transparency without linking it to trust would be non-relevant. Edge cases include texts that use synonyms like generalized social trust or confidence in others (relevant), or pieces that mention trust only in passing without substantive discussion or measurement (likely non-relevant).
7422	psychische	The query seeks summaries and validation details of German-language instruments and projects measuring psychological health and related constructs in nonclinical and workplace contexts (e.g., depression, anxiety, irritation, psychosomatic complaints, idiopathic environmental intolerance, symptom interpretation, psychosocial safety climate, perceived job characteristics). It also asks for brief descriptions of associated studies and scales (e.g., HEALSEE, LoneCovid, FIFI-K, Human Flourishing Scale) including subscales, theoretical bases, and pretest methods.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses mental states or health, such as psychological symptoms, wellbeing, risk, or organizational supports for mental health, including measurement tools or models (e.g., questionnaires on depressivity, irritation, anxiety, psychosomatic complaints, or “psychische Jobanforderungen”). Examples of clearly relevant content include scales grounded in Beck or Lazarus models that assess cognitive/emotional irritation, instruments for idiopathic environmental intolerance that capture psychological complaints, Psychosocial Safety Climate tools about protecting employees’ mental health, or wellbeing measures like the Human Flourishing Scale that include mental health dimensions; projects like LoneCovid or HEALSEE are relevant when they explicitly query psychological complaints or illnesses. Documents are non-relevant if they focus solely on physical conditions or general methodology (e.g., cognitive interview procedures) without linking to psychological constructs, or if “psychische” appears only incidentally (e.g., in a title list) without substantive discussion. Edge cases that should still count as relevant include synonyms and compounds (psychological/mental, psychosocial, psychosomatic) when they concern mental states or wellbeing, organizational-level climate around mental health, or instruments that predict psychological wellbeing from other domains (e.g., leisure interests) with an explicit mental-health linkage. Conversely, materials that mention related terms but analyze only non-psychological outcomes, or that use “psycho-” in unrelated contexts, should be treated as non-relevant.
7445	psychische erkrankungen	The query seeks German research instruments and surveys related to mental health and psychosomatic conditions, especially non-clinical measures of depression, irritation, anxiety, symptom interpretation, idiopathic environmental intolerance, and wellbeing. It also aims to find tools and studies on workplace psychosocial safety climate and healthcare-seeking behavior, including development, validation, and pretest reports.	A document is relevant if it directly addresses mental illnesses or closely related constructs—such as depression, anxiety, psychosomatic disorders—and their assessment, prevention, diagnosis, symptoms, or treatment. For example, scales on depressivity, irritation (cognitive/emotional), and generalized anxiety in non-clinical contexts, instruments aiming to detect mental or psychosomatic disorders early, workplace “Psychosocial Safety Climate” measures tied to employees’ mental health, and surveys on healthcare seeking that include psychological complaints all match the query. Edge cases include idiopathic environmental intolerance and psychosomatic complaint scales (relevant when psychological symptoms or mental disorder risk are central), as well as Human Flourishing or leisure-interest instruments that touch mental health or predict well-being but may be only tangential unless explicitly linked to mental disorders. Non-relevant items focus primarily on physical conditions (e.g., a cardiology prevention survey without mental health content), administrative pretest details (layout, consent, data protection) without substantive mental-health constructs, or job-characteristic measures not tied to psychological outcomes. German terms such as Depressivität, Angst, psychische/psychosomatische Erkrankungen, and psychische Befindensbeeinträchtigung signal relevance—even in non-clinical settings—when the aim is prevention or identification of mental illness.
7488	psychische belastung	Find validated German-language measures and instruments for assessing psychological strain (psychische Belastung) in non-clinical and workplace contexts, including scales for irritation, depression, anxiety, job demands/characteristics, psychosomatic complaints, and psychosocial safety climate. The user likely needs details on each tool’s constructs, development, reliability/validity, and practical applications.	A document is relevant to the query “psychische Belastung” when it explicitly measures, describes, or seeks to prevent psychological strain or mental burden, especially in non-clinical or workplace contexts. Clear positives include instruments and studies on irritation (cognitive/emotional), non-clinical depressivity or anxiety, psychosocial safety climate (organizational commitment to employees’ mental health), perceived job characteristics (job demands, decision latitude), teacher scales capturing experienced burden, and tools designed to detect preclinical intervention needs or psychosomatic complaints from ongoing stressors. Items about general well-being or mental health (e.g., Human Flourishing, LoneCovid social relations, healthcare-seeking) are only partially relevant unless they directly quantify psychological load or strain. Non-relevant examples include evaluation tools for exam quality or leisure interests (where “Belastung” may denote test difficulty or workload), or symptom-interpretation measures that focus on attribution rather than the level of psychological burden. Edge cases like idiopathic environmental intolerance can be relevant if framed as psychosomatic/psychological strain, and terms such as “Betriebsklima,” “Jobanforderungen,” or “psychische Befindensbeeinträchtigung” are strong relevance signals, whereas “Belastung” used purely for task load or administrative burden without a mental health frame is not.
79	environment	The user is seeking scholarly resources on measuring and analyzing “environment” in a social-science context—especially validated questionnaires for environmental attitudes, behaviors, and efficacy, and methodological guidance on using mobile and web-tracking data to study individual behavior in online/social environments.	A document is clearly relevant if it addresses the natural environment or ecological issues, such as environmental attitudes, behaviors, and knowledge, or presents measurement tools like the Scale System for Environmental Consciousness (SEU), the Ecology Scale, perceptions of global ecological problems, or environmental efficacy. For example, questionnaires that gauge willingness to refrain from certain behaviors for the sake of the environment, to donate money for protection, or beliefs that pro-environmental actions make a difference (e.g., the ISSP environmental efficacy scale with seven items and cross-country psychometrics) directly match the query. Content focused on web tracking or mobile research methods is non-relevant unless it explicitly applies those methods to environmental topics (e.g., studies of climate change communication), as references to “online environments” alone are about digital contexts, not ecology. Mentions of “social environment” or a “sense of belonging” are edge cases that use the term in a social-psychological sense and would generally be non-relevant to an environmental query. Likewise, scales like Right-Wing Authoritarianism or interviews about app infrastructure are non-relevant unless they are tied to environmental outcomes or behavior.
7939	psychologie	Information on psychology-based interventions and tools: a behavioral project to improve hand hygiene compliance in hospitals, and the Münster Questionnaire add-on for evaluating digital teaching during COVID-19. Also seeks how the survey is applied to digital/hybrid courses to gather student feedback.	A document is relevant to the query “psychologie” if it explicitly engages with psychology as a field—e.g., references to psychological theories, methods, institutions, or applications—and/or contains the term “Psychologie.” The provided paragraph qualifies because it mentions Medizinische Psychologie and an Institut für Psychologie and applies behavioral psychology to hand hygiene compliance and to evaluating digital teaching via validated questionnaires. By contrast, a text focused only on hygiene procedures, infection control metrics, or survey administration details without a psychological framework would be weakly relevant, even if situated in a hospital or university. Edge cases include mentions of “Psychologie” only in affiliations, bibliographies, or course listings without substantive psychological content, which are marginal; English equivalents (“psychology”) or adjacent fields (behavioral science, psychiatry) may be relevant depending on user intent. Likewise, documents about digital teaching that lack psychological constructs or institutional ties to psychology would not satisfy the query.
81	climate change	The user is looking for social and behavioral science resources related to climate change. Specifically, they seek methods and instruments to study climate change communication and to measure individuals’ awareness of global environmental consequences (e.g., web tracking guides and relevant scales).	A document is relevant to the query “climate change” when it addresses Earth’s changing climate, its causes, impacts, mitigation/adaptation policies, scientific evidence, or public communication about climate change—for example, a guide that uses web tracking to study climate change communication or research that measures awareness of consequences for global environmental changes. In contrast, texts that use “climate” in a non-environmental sense (e.g., family climate, teaching climate, organizational climate indexes like BOKX) are not relevant, nor are materials focused on organizational change, acculturation, occupational classifications (EGP, Blossfeld), course evaluations, or general LLM overviews without climate-specific content. Brief or passing mentions, such as listing “climate change communication” among many example topics in a methods guide, are only marginally relevant unless the document contains substantive sections on that topic. An edge case is a psychological scale about “global environmental changes”: it may be relevant if it explicitly measures climate change attitudes or behaviors, but not if it treats environmental issues in a vague or unrelated way. Similarly, pandemic-related fear scales or gender role attitude surveys are non-relevant unless they explicitly link findings to climate change contexts.
8246	politisches engagement	The user is seeking validated German-language questionnaires and survey modules for measuring political engagement and related socio-political attitudes and behaviors (e.g., political efficacy, cynicism, conservatism, immigration and environmental attitudes). They want details on the constructs covered, psychometric properties, and pretesting methods, including examples from projects such as DDR participation studies and CSES Module 5.	A document is relevant if it directly measures, analyzes, or describes political engagement or participation, such as instruments or studies on citizens’ political activities, interest, or efficacy (e.g., SOWI’s Politisches Engagement scale, the DDR “Eingabenkultur” project on participation, CSES items on political interest/participation, or PEKS as a close antecedent of engagement). It also counts if it targets engagement within a political domain like environmental politics when it involves public or collective actions (protests, petitions, contacting officials), not just private eco-behaviors. Documents are non-relevant when “engagement” refers to non-political contexts (workplace engagement in EXQ, “perceived engagement” in LMX) or appears as a subfacet label unrelated to political action (e.g., NFC’s “engagement” facet, ALLO-15’s engagement with outgroups), and when content focuses solely on ideology or attitudes without a link to participation (e.g., SECS-GER) unless tied to engagement outcomes. Edge cases include constructs like political cynicism or false consensus beliefs: they are relevant if framed as determinants or measures connected to political participation, but not if they only gauge attitudes with no behavioral or participatory implication. Historical or methodological pieces (cognitive interview pretests) are relevant when the items explicitly assess political engagement, even if the document’s primary focus is instrument validation rather than behavior.
828	nachhaltigkeit	The user is seeking resources on sustainability in mathematics education. Specifically, they want assessment instruments that measure beliefs about the role of mathematics in sustainable development and learners’ self-efficacy in mathematical modeling, such as the BMNE and related scales developed and piloted in a teaching project.	A document is relevant to the query “nachhaltigkeit” when it substantively discusses sustainability or sustainable development, including frameworks like “Bildung für nachhaltige Entwicklung” (BNE/ESD) or applications such as modeling sustainability-related topics (e.g., speed limits, heat pumps, electric cars). Content that measures beliefs or competencies tied to sustainability—such as scales assessing the perceived importance of mathematics for sustainable development or self-efficacy in mathematical modeling for sustainability—also counts as relevant. Mentions of recognized policy or competency documents (e.g., KMK/BMZ 2016 on Global Development competencies) strengthen relevance by situating the work in the sustainability education context. By contrast, documents that use “nachhaltig” only in a generic sense (like “lasting impact” or “durable”) or that include “Nachhaltigkeit” merely in a project title or funding note without substantive discussion are weakly or non-relevant. Edge cases include texts focusing on methodology (e.g., psychometric scale development) that still apply directly to sustainability themes—these are relevant—whereas methodological pieces with no clear link to sustainability topics would not be.
8382	politische werte	The user seeks an overview of how to measure political values and orientations, including validated short scales and items for constructs like individual reflective values, political efficacy, political cynicism, conservatism, and attitudes toward climate change, immigration/asylum, antisemitism, gender equality, and in-/out‑group authority. They also want methodological guidance on handling missing data and response biases in surveys, plus references to relevant datasets and pretests (e.g., FGZ Cohesion Panel, CSES Module 5, PAWCER) for comparative analysis.	A document is relevant to the query “politische werte” if it defines, measures, or analyzes political value orientations (e.g., tolerance, egalitarianism, conservatism, authoritarianism) or presents instruments and findings about them, such as the IRV short scale linked to the Schwartz value model, political efficacy (PEKS), political cynicism (KPZ), and German versions of social/economic conservatism (SECS GER). Content that ties specific issue attitudes to broader values—like items on climate change, antisemitism, gender equality, asylum policy, or environmental engagement—can also be relevant when framed as manifestations of underlying political values (e.g., tolerance vs. exclusion, universalism vs. tradition). Cross-national surveys and modules (CSES, PAWCER, left–right scales) are relevant if they map or compare political value structures, determinants, or consequences. By contrast, methodological pieces on missing-data imputation, response biases, or a teamwork SJT are non-relevant unless they explicitly connect to the measurement of political values; similarly, retrospective accounts of DDR participation are only relevant if they analyze value orientations rather than behavior alone. Edge cases include domain-specific attitude scales that may look topical (e.g., “authenticity of asylum claims”): they are relevant only when validated as indicators of broader value constructs (e.g., authoritarianism, outgroup threat) rather than narrow policy opinions.
8951	politische einstellungen	The user is seeking standardized survey instruments, scales, and datasets for measuring political attitudes in the German/European context. They want examples and documentation on topics such as immigration/asylum, left–right orientation, income redistribution, welfare state, climate change, antisemitism, gender equality, political efficacy/cynicism, authority/values, and the pretesting/validation methods used.	A document is relevant if it operationalizes or analyzes political attitudes through survey items, validated scales, or pretests, especially within German/European studies. Clear examples include CSES Module 5 (interest, elites, immigrants, redistribution), ESS immigration wording experiments, SECS-GER for social/economic conservatism, KPZ for political cynicism, PEKS for political efficacy, and ALLBUS/FGZ pretests on climate change, antisemitism, and gender equality as political attitude domains. Methodological reports using cognitive interviews, web probing, or psychometric validation are also relevant when they evaluate how political attitudes are measured or interpreted. Non-relevant are general political news or policy descriptions, or projects on social networks or environment that lack explicit attitudinal measures (e.g., LoneCovid network questions without links to political trust/compliance, or purely behavioral environmental indices). Edge cases like DDR participation histories, authority/family-structure scales, or welfare-state opinions qualify when framed as attitudes toward state, authority, or redistribution, but not when they only present demographics or institutional background.
9035	politics	The user is looking for resources on measuring political attitudes and behaviors, including validated short scales for efficacy, participation, cynicism, conservatism, national pride, system satisfaction, and partisan identity. They also seek methodological guidance on using web tracking data and insights from research on social media’s effects on democracy.	A document is relevant to the query “politics” when it directly examines political behavior, attitudes, systems, or participation—for example, descriptions and validations of scales like Political Efficacy (PESS/PEKS), Left–Right Self-Placement, political cynicism, conservatism (SECS), satisfaction with the political system (SPS), or partisan identity. Content that analyzes how media and technology shape democracy and political communication, such as an interview summarizing research on social media’s effects on polarization and misinformation, is also clearly relevant. Methodological discussions remain relevant when they are applied to political constructs (e.g., psychometric validity, cross-national invariance for political measures, or web tracking used to study news use and political participation), but would be less relevant if they focused solely on technical procedures (like translation methods or software implementation) without a political application. Edge cases include topics like national pride or epistemology that become political when tied to regime legitimacy, discrimination, or public policy debates—these count if the political linkage is explicit. By contrast, documents that only mention “politics” in passing, treat “politics” as office dynamics, or discuss web tracking/health information without any political angle would be non-relevant.
9089	political trust	The user is looking for validated survey instruments to measure political trust and closely related constructs, with details on scale structure, reliability/validity, and cross-national comparability. They want short, practical measures suitable for time-limited questionnaires (e.g., social/interpersonal trust, political efficacy, cynicism, and system satisfaction).	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses citizens’ trust in political institutions, authorities, or the political system, including definitions, determinants, trends, or measurement (e.g., scales of political cynicism, satisfaction with the political system, or external political efficacy as responsiveness of the system). Content about political cynicism (KPZ), political system satisfaction (SPS), or links between transparency and trust in institutions would count as relevant, as would validated short measures of political trust or distrust across countries. By contrast, materials focused on interpersonal or generalized social trust (e.g., KUSIV3, ESS social trust), organizational trust in employee–superior relationships, participation behavior, ideology (e.g., conservatism scales), national pride, or immigration attitudes are non-relevant unless they explicitly tie those constructs to trust in political institutions. Edge cases include studies on “trust” that do not specify the political target, or methodological papers whose validation is about non-political trust; these are not relevant, while cross-national validation of political-trust constructs would be. For example, an ESS module on generalized social trust is non-relevant unless it includes items like trust in parliament or government, whereas short scales capturing political cynicism or system satisfaction are directly relevant.
9169	political interest	The user is looking for ways to measure political interest, especially brief validated survey scales and their psychometric properties. They may also seek related measures (e.g., efficacy, participation, cynicism) and methodological guides (web/mobile tracking, Google Trends) for studying political engagement.	A document is relevant if it defines, measures, or analyzes political interest as a construct (e.g., a two-item scale capturing respondents’ interest in politics, its reliability/validity, or its links to participation). Methods pieces can be relevant when they use digital traces to infer political interest specifically, such as web or mobile tracking of political news consumption or Google Trends queries about political topics. Content on adjacent constructs (political efficacy, participation, cynicism, pride, left–right self-placement) is only relevant when it explicitly examines their relationship to political interest or uses a political-interest measure as a variable; otherwise it’s peripheral. Items about “interest” in non-political domains (e.g., leisure interests) or general “public interest” without a political focus are non-relevant, as are broad interviews on social media and democracy that don’t address political interest. Edge cases include documents using proxies like “engagement,” “attention,” or search volume that must be clearly tied to political topics, and uses of “interest” meaning financial interest rates or “interest groups,” which are off-target.
9243	political efficacy	The user wants to understand political efficacy—especially the distinction between internal and external efficacy—and how it is measured. They are seeking brief, validated scales and evidence on their reliability, validity, and cross-cultural comparability.	Documents are relevant when they define political efficacy (especially the distinction between internal and external efficacy) and/or present, adapt, or validate instruments that measure it in political contexts. Highly relevant examples include scale descriptions and psychometric evaluations of PESS/PEKS or Perceived Political Self-Efficacy (PPSE), evidence of reliability/validity, incremental validity for predicting political participation, translation procedures (e.g., TRAPD), and cross-national measurement invariance. Papers on self-efficacy in non-political domains (environmental, occupational, academic, mobbing) or on general self-efficacy are only tangential unless they explicitly link efficacy to political beliefs or behaviors; similarly, measures of political attitudes like cynicism, left-right placement, national pride, or system satisfaction are related but not about efficacy. Methodological critiques of political efficacy measures, short-form versus full-scale comparisons, and discussions of construct and criterion validity are within scope. Edge cases include cross-cultural adaptations and survey design constraints (short scales), which are relevant if they concern political efficacy specifically; mentions of “efficacy” that refer to effectiveness broadly or to participation behaviors without the belief component are non-relevant.
928	corona	The user is looking for information on the COVID-19 (“corona”) pandemic in the context of a study using the eDFS-K, a scale measuring children’s future-related fears during epidemics. They want details on the scale’s purpose, structure, target age, and its application to German elementary students in 2020–2021.	A document is relevant if “corona” refers to the coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic (including synonyms like SARS-CoV-2) and discusses its effects, measures, research, or experiences. The paragraph is relevant because it explicitly links a children’s fear scale to the corona pandemic in 2020–2021 and describes a questionnaire administered in German elementary schools. Non-relevant items would use “corona” in unrelated senses, such as the solar corona, electrical corona discharge, dental/anatomical terms (e.g., corona radiata), the Corona beer brand, or place names like Corona, California. Edge cases include occurrences where “corona” is only a substring (coronation, coronal) or titles that include “corona” but concern unrelated topics; these should be excluded unless the surrounding context clearly involves the pandemic. Conversely, documents that say “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2” without the exact word “corona” may still be relevant if query expansion is allowed.
974	psychische gesundheit	The user is seeking German resources on mental health that focus on the development and validation of survey instruments (e.g., psychosocial safety climate, flourishing, irritation, anxiety, work addiction) used in workplaces and population studies, including Covid-19 impacts. They want details on questionnaire pretests and measures for assessing well-being, symptoms, physical activity, healthcare seeking, and occupational factors.	A document is relevant if it directly addresses mental health (psychische Gesundheit) outcomes, determinants, protection, or measurement—e.g., organizational policies like Psychosocial Safety Climate (PSC), COVID-19 effects on mental health (LoneCovid), or psychometric tools for depression, anxiety, irritation, psychosomatic complaints, work addiction, and the Human Flourishing Scale’s mental health dimension. Content that links job characteristics, stress models (e.g., Lazarus), or workplace wellbeing screening (e.g., BOKX) to psychological health is also clearly relevant. Edge cases include studies on healthcare seeking or symptom interpretation that are relevant only when they assess psychological complaints or attributions, and topics like idiopathic environmental intolerance which straddle physical and psychological domains. Documents focusing solely on physical activity or active transport, general patient satisfaction with visits, or demographic surveys are non-relevant unless they explicitly tie these to mental health outcomes. Given the German query, materials using terms such as psychische Gesundheit, psychological wellbeing, psychological distress, or psychosocial safety in German context increase relevance.
14255	konsum	The user seeks a concise explanation of consumer ethnocentrism — the belief that domestic products are superior to foreign ones — and how it is measured (the 15‑item short and 20‑item long CETSCALE). They want the theoretical background (Jacoby 1978) and the kinds of economic, social and moral beliefs the scale captures, such as the idea that buying foreign goods harms the domestic economy and increases unemployment.	This document is relevant to the query "konsum" because it directly describes consumers' beliefs about buying domestic versus foreign products and presents a 15- or 20-item scale measuring consumer ethnocentrism — a core aspect of consumption behavior. It is useful when the interest is in consumer attitudes, measurement instruments, references (e.g., Jacoby 1978), and how economic, social, and moral considerations shape purchase decisions (for example, shoppers who avoid imports to protect local jobs). It would be non-relevant if the query intends a different sense of "konsum" (such as medical drug consumption, substance use, or macro-level production statistics) or if a document only mentions the term without discussing consumer behavior. Borderline cases include papers on nationalism or trade policy that touch on consumer ethnocentrism (partially relevant) and highly technical psychometric reports that describe the scale structure but provide no context about actual purchasing behavior (less relevant).
15640	karriere	The user is looking for information about a career-related questionnaire that measures three domains—career orientation, performance- and success-promoting work attitudes, and fear of failure—and wants to understand that its items are phrased to capture respondents' self-perceived, performance-related attitudes and behaviors.	A document is relevant to the keyword "karriere" if it deals with career orientation, career-related attitudes or measures—especially questionnaires and psychometric items that capture self-perceived, performance-related behaviors and fears (for example studies validating a career-orientation scale or vocational counseling instruments that assess fear of failure). Relevant examples include research on career orientation, instruments measuring success‑oriented work attitudes, and surveys that ask respondents to reflect on their career‑related behaviors and anxieties. Documents are non-relevant if they only use "karriere" in passing, discuss unrelated topics (e.g., product career metaphors, purely technical performance metrics), or focus on general personality constructs without any career context. Edge cases include papers that address fear of failure or work attitudes but not explicitly in a career context (partially relevant), documents in other languages or using synonyms like "Beruf" or "career" which should be matched by translation, and psychometric studies that are relevant only if their items explicitly target career constructs rather than broad self‑esteem.
1670	rassismus	A person searching "rassismus" here likely wants to know how negative and positive attitudes toward outgroups are conceptualized and measured — specifically the distinction that they form independent continua and the existence of a German Allophilie scale (five subdimensions: affection, comfort, kinship, engagement, enthusiasm) and a Law-and-Order scale for xenophobic, state-control attitudes. They may also be seeking information on these scales' development (based on Pittinsky et al. and Fend) and their validation evidence (construct, convergent/discriminant, and criterion validity).	This document is relevant to the query "rassismus" because it describes validated instruments that measure attitudes toward outgroups—both positive (Allophilia: affection, comfort, kinship, engagement, enthusiasm) and negative (Law-and-Order: rejection of the foreign and support for coercive state measures)—which are central constructs in research on racism and xenophobia. It gives concrete details (scale structure, three items per subscale, validation with persons from foreign cultures) that make it useful for someone seeking measurement tools or empirical studies of prejudice. It may be less relevant if the searcher is looking for legal definitions, historical accounts, hate-crime case reports, or analyses of structural/institutional racism, because the paragraph focuses on psychological scales and attitudes rather than policy or lived incidents. An important edge case: Allophilia captures positive feelings toward outgroups and can miss subtle or covert racism, while the Law-and-Order scale targets authoritarian anti-foreigner tendencies—so researchers should consider adapting the scales if they need race-specific, systemic, or behavioral measures.
17057	kinderbetreuung	The user is looking for information about childcare ("kinderbetreuung") — what types of care are available, how to find and enroll children, typical hours and age groups, costs, and any subsidies or regulations. Their goal is to choose and arrange appropriate, reliable care for a child.	Documents are relevant to the query "kinderbetreuung" when they directly address childcare: descriptions of daycare, kindergarten and after‑school programs; how to apply; opening hours; costs and subsidies; staff qualifications; legal definitions and local regulations. Highly relevant examples include municipal lists of childcare providers, application forms for a Kita place, fee schedules, eligibility rules for subsidies, or official guidance on child-to-staff ratios. Non-relevant documents either do not meaningfully discuss childcare (e.g., a passing mention of the word), cover unrelated topics that happen to include the term, or use the word in a different sense (such as a fictional title or an unrelated compound). Edge cases include materials where "kinderbetreuung" appears only in metadata or images (OCR may be needed), academic papers on early childhood theory that lack practical service information (partly relevant), or documents from other countries whose systems differ but still offer useful comparisons. Also consider language and recency: German-language, up‑to‑date local or legal information will usually be more useful than outdated or purely historical references.
17717	kinderwunsch	The user wants information on "kinderwunsch"—people’s fertility intentions and desired number of children—and how family-related norms and attitudes (e.g., views on fathers’ parental leave, parental employment, and concepts of family and partnership) influence those intentions in Germany. They may also seek how these attitudes are measured in surveys (questions about actual and ideal number of children) and tested using cognitive interviews, as in the BiB pretest.	A document is relevant to the keyword "kinderwunsch" when it explicitly addresses fertility intentions or desired family size (terms like "gewünschte Kinderzahl," "ideale Kinderzahl," or "fertility intentions") or when it reports survey questions that measure people’s desire to have children. The paragraph is relevant because it explicitly mentions the desired and ideal number of children and tests attitude questions about parenting and parental leave using personally conducted cognitive interviews, which directly measure Kinderwunsch-related attitudes. Documents that analyze how family ideals, employment, or parental-leave policies influence the wish to have children are also highly relevant because they connect contextual factors to childbearing intentions. Edge cases include materials that only report fertility rates or demographic counts without assessing individual desires (partially relevant), papers focused on assisted reproductive technologies or clinical infertility care that use "Kinderwunsch" in a medical sense (potentially irrelevant to sociological intent), or discussions of family policy that never link to people’s childbearing intentions (less relevant).
19136	migra	The user is looking for methods and tools to identify and measure migration background and related constructs (acculturation, ethnic/national identity, cross‑cultural loss, attitudes toward asylum seekers) in German research. Specifically they need information on survey items, validated scales and translations, psychometric properties, and practical implementation (e.g., SAS/SPSS/Stata code, Mikrozensus Scientific Use Files) for analysis.	A document is relevant to the keyword "migra" when it substantively discusses migration or migrants — for example items about "Migrationshintergrund," immigration and integration surveys (Mikrozensus, RESPOND), acculturation and identity scales, asylum-seeker questionnaires, or psychometric instruments and codebooks (SAS/SPSS/Stata) used to typify migration background. Strong signals of relevance include detailed methodology, questionnaire items, sample languages (e.g. Arabic, Farsi, Russian), validation statistics, or explicit focus on immigrant populations, whereas a single passing use of the word "migration" or a brief metadata tag is weak evidence. Non-relevant documents include cases where "migra" appears only as part of an unrelated word (e.g. "migraine"), a brand name, an unrelated acronym (MIGRA), or discussions of biological/animal migration with no human migration context. Edge cases to watch for are multilingual uses like Spanish "la migra" (immigration enforcement), internal versus international migration distinctions, or very short mentions that require more context — in those cases require additional topical content before labeling the document relevant.
21585	linksrechtsskala	User wants a concise explanation of the "left–right scale" (Links-Rechts-Skala) as used in the PAWCER pretests: what it measures, how it is operationalized, and how it was tested. Specifically, they need to know that the scale maps respondents' ideological profiles across four subdimensions (economic libertarianism, conservatism, socialism, liberalism) by assigning scores to each dimension to enable individual and group comparisons, and that these questions were evaluated using face-to-face cognitive interviews.	A document is relevant to the query "linksrechtsskala" when it explicitly treats the Left–Right scale as an instrument — describing its operationalization, scoring and use (for example the four subdimensions: economic libertarianism, conservatism, socialism and liberalism), its application in cross‑national surveys such as PAWCER or the Values in Crisis study, or the pretest methods used (e.g. cognitive interviews, personally administered interviews). Concrete implementation details (question wording, subdimension items, scoring rules, translations or country versions) and empirical uses (comparisons of ideological profiles, links to welfare or climate attitudes) make a document especially relevant. Documents are non‑relevant if they only mention "left" or "right" rhetorically, treat left/right in nonpolitical senses (traffic, anatomy), or report a simple single‑item self‑placement without engaging the multidimensional LinksRechtsSkala or its measurement properties. Borderline cases include related two‑axis instruments (like the Political Compass) or theoretical discussions of ideology: these are partially relevant when they map economic and sociocultural dimensions or compare measurement approaches, but less so if they never address the specific subdimension structure or survey implementation.
21895	linksrechts	The user is looking for information about the "left–right" political orientation question (Links–Rechts-Skala) used in the PAWCER project pretests—how the question was worded and evaluated. They likely want details on how this item (tested via face-to-face cognitive interviews) performed alongside questions on income differences and redistribution for cross‑national comparisons of welfare, climate, and energy attitudes.	A document is relevant to the query "linksrechts" if it explicitly discusses the left–right political orientation scale or contains survey items, coding, or results about left–right self-placement (e.g., the LinksRechtsSkala, questionnaire wording, translation issues, or cross-country comparisons of left–right positions). Materials describing pretests, cognitive interviews, or psychometric tests of left–right items—for example reports of face‑to‑face cognitive interviews used to refine a left–right question—are clearly relevant. Documents that focus on the PAWCER project’s topics (welfare, climate, energy) are only relevant when they also address measurement of political orientation; otherwise they are not. Watch for false positives such as texts using "links" and "rechts" as literal directions, file names, or unrelated code, or content that discusses redistribution attitudes without explicitly linking them to a left–right scale. Finally, language and tokenization edge cases matter: German variants (LinksRechtsSkala, links-rechts, linksrechts) and synonyms like “political ideology” or “left–right self-placement” should be treated as relevant matches.
22951	medienkonsum	The user wants to understand how media consumption relates to empathy and how media-based empathy is measured—specifically information on the MBE scale (Happ & Pfetsch, 2015), its four subscales (medial concern, affective media empathy, cognitive media empathy, and video-game immersion), its psychometric properties across adolescents and adults, and the special role of immersion in games.	A document is relevant to the query "medienkonsum" if it directly examines media consumption behaviors, digital media use patterns, or measurement instruments that capture empathy and reactions in media contexts—such as the MBE/MBE‑Skala (mediale Anteilnahme, affektive/kognitive Medienempathie, immersion in video games) and its psychometric validation in adolescent and adult samples. Empirical studies that report sample sizes, factor structure, reliability, and links between media use and outcomes (e.g., aggression, cyberbullying, immersion effects) are highly pertinent because they address how media consumption shapes emotional responses. Documents that are not relevant include those focused solely on face‑to‑face empathy without any media context, on unrelated consumption types (e.g., food consumption), or on media production/marketing strategies that do not analyze users’ consumption or empathic responses. Edge cases include papers that mention "medienkonsum" only tangentially, studies of media multitasking or gameplay mechanics that do not assess empathic processes (borderline relevant), and translations or policy briefs in German that lack empirical measurement but summarize consumption trends (potentially relevant depending on depth).
2585	kriminalität	A user wants an overview of crime-related research and survey instruments used in European projects, including topics like fear of crime and local safety perceptions, internet-facilitated pharmaceutical crime, illicit trade in cultural goods, and a youth self-report delinquency scale. They also need details on the specific survey questions and the cognitive pretesting methods applied (online/web probing, face‑to‑face and telephone cognitive interviews).	A document is relevant to the keyword "kriminalität" if it explicitly treats crime or criminality—its types, prevalence, victims or offenders, prevention and enforcement policies, or research about the “dark figure” of unreported crime. For example, texts like the AUDITS pretest (fear of crime, citizens’ safety perceptions), the ALPhA study (internet-facilitated drug crime and fraudulent medicine suppliers), the ILLICID project (illicit trade in antiquities and dark‑field measurement), or a youth self‑report delinquency scale are clearly relevant because they investigate criminal behavior, markets, or prevention. Documents that are non‑relevant either lack any crime content or only mention crime incidentally (e.g., a methodological paper on web‑probing without applying it to criminal topics, or administrative reports about unrelated municipal services). Edge cases include texts on “security” or “safety” that are relevant only when they address criminal threats (traffic safety as crime prevention vs. non‑criminal accident prevention), or pieces where the term appears as a substring or in translation errors; in such cases relevance depends on whether criminal intent, illegal markets, victimization, or law enforcement are substantively discussed. Good signals of relevance are explicit crime-related keywords, empirical measures of offenses or fear of crime, descriptions of illicit markets or offenders/victims, and discussion of prevention or policy responses.
26363	verkehrsmittel	The user likely wants to know what "Verkehrsmittel" means in this context — i.e., modes or means of transportation — and how it is treated in the SEU scale. Specifically, they want to understand that transport use is one of seven content domains in the SEU, measured by items assessing awareness of the ecological consequences of one’s transport choices and related self-reported behaviors.	A document is relevant to the keyword "verkehrsmittel" when it explicitly treats means of transport or transport use (e.g., verkehrsmittelnutzung, verkehrsmittelwahl) as a substantive topic—particularly in relation to environmental attitudes, behavioral intentions, or the ecological consequences of transport choices, such as studies using the SEU scale or items that measure awareness of action consequences. Good examples are surveys comparing car versus public-transport use, questionnaires that include the four-item awareness-of-consequences measure for transport behavior, or papers that apply Maloney & Ward or Schwartz’s scales to transport-related pro-environmental actions. Documents are non-relevant if the term appears only in a list or as a passing example, or if the focus is technical (vehicle engineering, timetables, traffic law) with no connection to attitudes, behavior, or environmental impact. Edge cases include translated or compound forms (verkehrsmittelnutzung) which are relevant when they report specific measures or findings, but only moderately relevant when the mention is peripheral (e.g., a single item in a broad multi-domain scale).
26823	technology	The user is looking for validated psychological measures and definitions related to attitudes toward technology — specifically a short, psychometrically tested "technology commitment" (Technikbereitschaft) scale that predicts successful use of new technologies (especially in older adults) and its three facets: technology acceptance, competence, and control beliefs. They also want information on a technophobia questionnaire that measures fear of technology across three dimensions: personal failure, human-versus-machine problems, and usability.	A document is relevant to the query "technology" when it centrally addresses people’s interactions with, attitudes toward, or measurement of responses to technology—for example studies that develop or validate scales of technology commitment, technology acceptance, competence, control beliefs, or technophobia. The provided paragraph is highly relevant because it reports the creation and psychometric validation of a short scale (Technikbereitschaft/TB) and a related questionnaire assessing technophobia across clear dimensions (personal failure, human-versus-machine, and usability), with application to predicting technology use in older adults. Documents that focus on technical specifications, engineering design, code, or hardware performance without considering human attitudes or adoption would be non-relevant even if they repeatedly use the word “technology.” Edge cases include research on digital literacy, usability, or policy: these are partially relevant when they measure or aim to change users’ readiness or fear of technology, but less relevant if they only discuss infrastructure, cost, or regulatory issues without human-centered measures.
2817	populismus	A user searching "populismus" here wants to know whether and how perceived economic inequalities drive support for populist parties, and specifically whether experimentally providing factual information about income and wealth distribution changes perceived inequality and populist attitudes. They may also be looking for details and results of a pretest that evaluated the clarity and plausibility of two informational graphics about Germany’s income and wealth distribution (available in the pretest PDF).	A document is relevant for the keyword "populismus" when it explicitly examines populism or populist attitudes — for example studies that link perceived inequality to support for right‑wing populist parties (as shown by ISSP findings naming the Progress Party in Norway, the Danish People’s Party, and Austria’s FPÖ) or projects that experimentally test whether information about income/wealth distribution changes populist preferences. The paragraph above is clearly relevant because it describes the "Perceived Inequalities and Populism" project and an experiment designed to measure causal effects on populist attitudes, even if the reported pretest only evaluated informational graphics. Documents are only partially relevant if they concern preparatory materials (e.g., graphic pretests or Web‑Probing methods) for a populism study but do not contain measures of populist attitudes or outcomes. Non‑relevant documents are those that discuss inequality, survey methodology, or political parties without any connection to populism, or that use "populism" metaphorically in unrelated fields. Edge cases include texts describing parties or movements that are populist in practice but not labeled as such (which may still be relevant) and cross‑national or left‑ vs right‑wing distinctions that require reading the content to judge relevance.
28676	worklife	The query "worklife" seeks information about work–life balance, working conditions, employment arrangements, and related wellbeing at work. The user is likely looking for survey instruments, measures, or research (e.g., ISSP, EWCS) on topics like job satisfaction, organizational commitment, work–family conflict, workplace mobbing, and digital skills at work.	A document is relevant to the query "worklife" when it directly addresses the relationship between work and other life domains or workplace conditions — for example studies or survey modules on work–life balance, working hours, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, workplace mobbing, or digital skills used at work. Concrete signals of relevance include survey questions or scales targeted at work-related constructs (e.g., ISSP work–life items, work–family conflict scales, the Luxembourg Workplace Mobbing Scale, or modules on ICT at work) and empirical results about employees’ or self‑employed persons’ working situations. Documents are non‑relevant when they focus on unrelated topics (household ICT use with no workplace module, purely methodological notes that do not cover work content, or instruments whose items are strictly about private life), even if they happen to contain the word “work” in metadata. Edge cases include methodological or translation reports — these are relevant only if they pertain to a workplace module or validate a work‑related scale; similarly, mixed‑scope instruments (e.g., ICT competence scales covering both private and work contexts) may be partially relevant depending on whether the workplace domain is analyzed separately.
2884	fremdenfeindlichkeit	The user wants a clear definition and overview of "Fremdenfeindlichkeit" (xenophobia), including how it is measured in survey research—e.g., consumer ethnocentrism scales, attitude-toward-foreigners items, and law-and-order measures—and wants information on instrument development, validation, and theoretical background.	A document is relevant to the query "fremdenfeindlichkeit" if it explicitly addresses attitudes toward foreigners or xenophobia, for example by reporting scales, item batteries, or theoretical accounts of ethnocentrism and anti-foreign prejudice (such as the consumer ethnocentrism scale, ALLBUS items, Jacobys 1978, or law-and-order positions derived from Fend). The paragraph you supplied is relevant because it documents instruments that operationalize attitudes toward foreigners (e.g., a four‑item scale in ALLBUS) and links consumer ethnocentrism to moral and economic arguments against buying foreign goods. It would be less relevant if it only treated product preferences or marketing behavior without connecting those preferences to hostile beliefs about foreigners, or if it contained only statistical/methodological details with no attitudinal content. Borderline cases include studies of consumer ethnocentrism that focus purely on purchase intention (partially relevant) and "law-and-order" measures that may capture xenophobia when they explicitly target "everything foreign" but could instead reflect non‑xenophobic crime concerns. Finally, documents that lack information on instrument development, validation, or theoretical background (as noted in the paragraph) are still topically relevant but less useful for rigorous research until those details are obtained.
31126	schichtarbeit	The user wants information about "schichtarbeit" (shift work): what it is and the different types of shift systems. They likely need details on legal regulations and workers' rights, effects on health and sleep, and practical scheduling or coping strategies for employers and employees.	A document is relevant to the keyword "schichtarbeit" if it directly discusses shift work topics such as types of shifts (night shifts, rotating/Wechselschicht), scheduling and rostering (Schichtplan), legal and collective-bargaining rules for shift schedules, or health and safety impacts like circadian disruption and fatigue. Useful examples include academic studies on the health effects of night work, employer policies or templates for shift rosters, guidance for nurses and factory workers on shift handovers, or software descriptions for shift planning. Documents are non-relevant when the term is absent or used metaphorically (e.g., "Schicht" meaning a geological layer or a painting layer), when job ads merely mention hours without specifying shift patterns, or when the mention of shift work is a passing aside with no substantive content. Edge cases include regional or legal variations (country-specific labor law references are relevant but only to that jurisdiction), documents using synonyms or misspellings (Nachtschicht, Schichtdienst, Wechselschicht), bilingual texts where "schichtarbeit" appears only in a caption, and scans/images with the word present but no searchable text—these can be borderline and require closer inspection for true relevance.
317	homeoffice	I want to know what questions about working from home were developed and tested in the 2024 BIBB–BAuA employee survey pretest and in the FReDA family-demographic panel pretests, and how those items were administered and evaluated. Specifically, I need details on the content of the home-office items and the testing methods used (telephone cognitive interviews for BIBB–BAuA and web probing online pretests for FReDA).	A document is relevant to the keyword "homeoffice" when it directly discusses working from home or telework — for example surveys, pretests or studies about frequency of homeworking, digital tools used, team collaboration, leadership in remote settings, or policies enabling homeoffice. Documents that test or report questionnaire items on "Arbeit im Homeoffice," measure conditions and prevalence, or evaluate related variables (childcare while teleworking, division of household labor) are clearly relevant. Borderline cases include texts that only mention "homeoffice" in a long list of topics or as an item in a questionnaire without substantive findings; these may be less useful but still potentially relevant depending on the search intent. Non-relevant documents are those using "home office" in a different sense (e.g., the UK Home Office government department), selling home-office furniture, or discussing domestic cybersecurity or interior design without any employment/telework context. Also treat synonyms (Telearbeit, remote work, work-from-home) and German-language sources as relevant, while excluding unrelated usages or purely administrative mentions.
3365	drogen	The user is looking for psychometric instruments and information related to drugs — specifically measures of adolescent drug-related delinquency, scales assessing treatment motivation for substance dependence (problem recognition, external pressure, need for help, treatment readiness), and questionnaires on reasons for not using smoking-cessation aids. They likely need these to identify suitable assessment tools for research or clinical evaluation of drug use and treatment engagement.	A document is relevant for the keyword "drogen" when it directly discusses drugs or substance use (e.g., Rauschmittel, Sucht, Abhängigkeit), drug‑related offenses, treatment for substance use disorders, or instruments that measure drug‑related behaviors and treatment motivation. For example, the paragraph mentions "Rauschmitteldelikte" (drug offenses), treatment motivation for dependence, and barriers to smoking‑cessation aids, so those passages would be relevant. A document that only treats general juvenile delinquency (theft, vandalism, violence) without any reference to substances would be non‑relevant, as would texts that merely use the word "drugs" metaphorically or in an unrelated context. Edge cases include materials about nicotine/tobacco cessation (may be relevant if the searcher intends "drogen" broadly), questionnaires that include a single drug‑related item among many non‑drug items (partially relevant), and documents in a different language or using only distant synonyms.
34145	rechtsextremismus	The user is looking for a concise overview of "rechtsextremismus" (right-wing extremism), including its defining beliefs, typical behaviors and symbols. They also want information on associated groups, legal status, societal risks, and prevention or countermeasures.	A document is relevant to the keyword "rechtsextremismus" if it directly addresses right‑wing extremism — its ideology, organizations, incidents, historical development, legal definitions, counter‑extremism policies, research studies, or detailed news reporting — especially when the term or close synonyms (e.g., rechtsextrem, right‑wing extremism) appear in the title or body. Examples of relevant items are government reports on neo‑Nazi groups, academic analyses of recruitment tactics, school curricula about radicalization, and court decisions applying statutes against extremist activity. Non‑relevant documents include those that only mention the word in passing, discuss "extremism" generically without a right‑wing focus, cover mainstream conservative politics (right‑of‑center but non‑extremist), or use similar words in unrelated senses (e.g., rechts meaning “right” direction or legal "Recht"). Edge cases include materials that are topically relevant but problematic — such as propaganda, recruitment pages, or SEO‑stuffed content — which are still relevant to the query but require careful handling; also related terms like rechtspopulismus or translations into English may overlap with but not exactly match "rechtsextremismus."
34932	rightwing	The user is likely looking for an explanation and measurement of right‑wing authoritarianism (RWA), specifically the BRWA6 short scale used in the Austrian National Election Study: its purpose, item format, and psychometric/theoretical background. They would want the scale's origin (Altemeyer 1981), the three subdimensions it measures (authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, and conventionalism), and information about validity and application in population surveys.	This document is relevant to the keyword "rightwing" when the intent is academic or psychological: it describes the BRWA6 balanced short scale for measuring Right‑Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) used in the Austrian National Election Study and explicitly references Altemeyer’s three subdimensions (authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, and conventionalism). It contains operational details (semantically opposed items, scale purpose, target population) and theoretical grounding useful for someone looking for measurement instruments, survey items, or psychometric validation related to right‑wing authoritarian attitudes. It is non‑relevant if the user is searching for news, party platforms, policy positions, or contemporary political movements labeled “right‑wing,” since this text focuses on scale construction and theory rather than political activity or ideology in the broader sense. Edge cases: the paragraph is in German, so it may be less useful to an English‑language searcher, and the term “rightwing” can also refer to unrelated contexts (sports, anatomy, or general conservative politics), where this methodological document would not match intent.
39506	sozialisation	User wants a clear explanation of "socialization"—how family and early social experiences shape attitudes, values and behaviors. They also want to know how researchers operationalize and measure socialization in surveys and studies (e.g., parental behavior dimensions, scales for early musical socialization, items on family roles, and cognitive pretesting/translations).	This document is highly relevant to the keyword "sozialisation" because it explicitly treats familial and early-life socialization processes — e.g., "musikalische Frühsozialisation," "familiäre Sozialisationsbedingungen," "Primärsozialisation," and parental rearing behaviors — and links them to attitudes, identity and generative behavior. Relevant passages include concrete examples such as scales measuring parental support versus religious upbringing, biographical inventories capturing primary socialization, and questions about parental roles and desired family size. It would be less relevant if the emphasis of a document were purely methodological (translation checks, cognitive pretests, or questionnaire administration) or if the topic were an unrelated use of the word (e.g., "socialization" meaning a social event). Edge cases include texts that mention socialization only as a background variable or focus only on scale construction and psychometrics: these are partially relevant for terminology and measurement but less useful for substantive theorizing about socialization processes.
43698	covid19	A user searching "covid19" here is likely seeking COVID‑19–related survey instruments and pretest documentation from German studies (FReDA, LoneCovid) — i.e., the infection and vaccination items, ego‑centric network questions, the epidemic‑related Dark Future Scale for children (eDFSK), and questionnaires for evaluating digital teaching. They want details on item wording/translations, cognitive testing methods (web probing, video interviews), target samples/ages (18–49 adults, partners, children 8–12, students) and how the instruments were implemented and validated.	A document is relevant to the query "covid19" when it directly addresses the coronavirus pandemic or its consequences — for example, questionnaires about COVID‑19 infection and vaccination, scales measuring pandemic-related anxiety in children, studies of social relationships during the COVID‑19 era, or evaluations of digital teaching implemented because of the pandemic. Concrete signals of relevance include explicit terms and variants (COVID‑19, Covid19, coronavirus, SARS‑CoV‑2), descriptions of pandemic‑specific methods (e.g., web probing of COVID items, video cognitive interviews about pandemic effects), and study timeframes tied to 2020–2021. A document is non‑relevant if it only mentions COVID‑19 tangentially (e.g., in passing as background) or if the token appears in metadata but the content focuses on unrelated topics; such items may be borderline relevant if the pandemic context meaningfully shapes the research design. Edge cases include translated items (German originals with English translations) where the translation quality affects keyword matching, and documents about other epidemics that compare to COVID‑19 — these are relevant only when the comparison substantially involves COVID‑19.
4811	ukraine	A general informational overview about Ukraine, including basic facts (location, capital, population), and likely interest in its history, politics, economy, culture, or current events (such as the conflict with Russia) and practical details like travel or visa requirements.	A document is relevant to the keyword "ukraine" if it substantially discusses the country, its people, places, institutions, events, language, culture, or economy — for example a news report on the Russia–Ukraine conflict, a travel guide to Kyiv, a history of Ukrainian independence, or an economic analysis of Ukraine’s GDP. Relevant documents may use variants and related terms such as “Ukrainian,” “Kyiv”/“Kiev,” “Donbas,” “Crimea,” or Cyrillic spellings (Україна), so these should be treated as matches even if the exact English string isn’t present. Non-relevant documents include items that only mention Ukraine in passing (a long list of countries where Ukraine is one of dozens), use a similar-looking word unrelated to the country (e.g., the phrase “you crane”), or are about a company or product that happens to include “Ukraine” in its name but contains no substantive information about the country. Edge cases include misspellings and transliterations, documents focused on territories or cities that are part of Ukraine without naming the country explicitly, and works that are relevant only to a specific intent (e.g., visa application guides vs. breaking news), so matching intent and depth of coverage is important when judging relevance.
5030	sicherheitsgefühl	Wanting to know how to measure residents' subjective sense of safety (Sicherheitsgefühl) in a municipality—covering fear of crime, street/traffic safety, and perceptions of local security work. Also seeking how these survey items were cognitively pretested online using the Web Probing method in the EU AUDITS project to inform local security policy analysis.	A document is relevant to the query "sicherheitsgefühl" if it explicitly studies or measures residents' subjective sense of safety—through surveys, interviews or perceptual indicators—and discusses how those perceptions inform local security policy. For example, texts that report on questions about fear of crime, safety in traffic, or citizens' perceptions of municipal safety work (as in the AUDITS project pretest using cognitive online web probing) are clearly pertinent. Documents that are not relevant include those that only give objective crime statistics, describe technical or IT-security measures, or discuss security policy in purely institutional terms without any attitudinal or perceptual data. Edge cases include papers that use synonyms (perceived safety, fear of crime), related constructs (trust in police, social cohesion) or methodological studies of survey instruments—these can be relevant even if they do not use the exact word "sicherheitsgefühl"—whereas pieces using the term in a different domain (e.g., workplace safety compliance or cybersecurity) may be false positives.
50581	digitalisierung	The user wants an overview of surveys, questionnaires and validated measurement instruments related to "Digitalisierung" — including national and EU surveys on ICT use, workplace digitalisation and IoT modules, scales for digital skills and technology readiness (e.g., ICTSC25, TB), tests of technophobia, and evaluation tools for digital teaching. They need information about available items, languages (German/English), and how these questions were pretested (cognitive interviews/web probing).	A document is relevant to the keyword "digitalisierung" if it substantively addresses digital technologies, ICT use, digital skills or workplace digitalization — for example pretests and modules on ICT at work, IoT surveys, items about home office and digital tools, or instruments like the ICTSC25 and the technology-commitment/technophobia scales. Concrete examples of relevant documents are the BIBB/BAuA Erwerbstätigenbefragung pretest on digitalization of work, the Community Survey modules on ICT use or IoT, and questionnaires evaluating digital teaching implemented during COVID-19. A document is non-relevant if it only mentions "Digitalisierung" in passing, consists solely of administrative metadata (sampling frames, fieldwork logistics) without substantive digital content, or deals with unrelated topics where digital terms are used as buzzwords. Edge cases include bilingual translation or cognitive-testing reports: these are relevant if the tested items cover digital topics (even if the focus is on wording), whereas psychometric papers about unrelated constructs or historical descriptions that do not engage with digital technologies would be borderline or non-relevant.
51730	alkohol	The user is likely seeking information on assessment tools for alcohol dependence, specifically a biographical questionnaire that evaluates underlying personality and life-history factors. They want to know which dimensions it measures (emotional insufficiency/neuroticism, adverse primary socialization, and goal striving) and how this biographical inventory differs from standard personality questionnaires by focusing on the patient's life story.	A document is relevant to the keyword "alkohol" when it substantively addresses alcohol use or alcohol dependence—especially assessment, treatment, epidemiology, or psychosocial instruments designed for people with alcohol problems. For example, the provided paragraph is relevant because it explicitly describes a biographical questionnaire constructed for alcohol-dependent individuals, maps personality dimensions related to alcoholism, and contrasts this inventory with general personality measures. Documents that are not relevant include those that only mention ethanol in a chemical or industrial context, recipes or marketing for alcoholic beverages, or texts where "alkohol" appears only incidentally (e.g., in a bibliography). Edge cases include papers in German (language does not reduce relevance if the topic is alcohol), general personality inventories that become relevant only when applied to alcohol-using samples, and studies focused on biomarkers or comorbid conditions that may be borderline unless they tie findings back to alcohol-specific assessment or outcomes.
52781	alkoholkonsum	A person searching "alkoholkonsum" is likely seeking concise information about alcohol consumption—its prevalence, health risks and possible benefits, recommended drinking limits, and public‑health guidelines. They may want statistics, trends, or practical advice for safer drinking or reducing alcohol use.	A document is relevant to the keyword "alkoholkonsum" if it directly addresses patterns, prevalence, health effects, guidelines, policy or prevention related to alcohol drinking—for example public‑health reports, epidemiological studies, WHO or national drinking‑limit recommendations, or clinical guidance on risks and interventions. Useful documents give concrete details such as consumption metrics (standard drinks or grams of alcohol), age and demographic breakdowns, regional laws or trends, and clear outcomes (liver disease, accidents, pregnancy risks); a page summarizing a study on binge drinking rates in Germany would be a strong match. Non‑relevant documents merely mentioning the word in passing, focusing only on alcohol production or cocktail recipes, discussing unrelated chemicals called “alcohols” in chemistry, or being primarily promotional/advertising content are poor matches. Edge cases include language and scope: German‑language or region‑specific materials are often more pertinent for a German query, while older reports or paywalled abstracts may be less useful unless they provide unique historical or methodological insight. Finally, documents that clarify measurement units, thresholds, and context (e.g., pregnancy, youth, cultural norms) are especially valuable; superficial lists or SEO pages that lack data or interpretation should be deprioritized.
53774	berufsausbildung	The query "berufsausbildung" seeks concise information about vocational training (apprenticeships) in Germany — what they are, their structure, duration, and legal/occupational framework. It may also ask how participation and outcomes are measured in surveys like the BIBB‑BAuA 2018 employment survey pretest (questions on training, workplace tasks, demands and health).	A document is relevant to the keyword "berufsausbildung" if it directly addresses vocational training and initial apprenticeship systems — for example, descriptions of the dual system, curricula, qualification outcomes, apprenticeship numbers, policy measures, or survey findings about participation in Aus- und Weiterbildung. The provided paragraph mentions "Aus- und Weiterbildung" within a broader BIBB/BAuA employment survey, so it would be partially relevant if the report contains substantive results about vocational training, apprenticeship pathways, or training needs identified in the survey. It is non‑relevant if the document only covers survey methodology, pretest procedures, cognitive interview techniques, or focuses solely on occupational health and workload without linking findings to vocational education. Edge cases include texts that discuss continuing education or in‑company training (Weiterbildung) — these can be borderline relevant depending on whether they treat initial vocational qualifications; likewise, mentions of "Ausbildung" in purely historical, legal, or non‑German contexts may be less useful despite keyword overlap.
54621	beschäftigungsverhältnis	The user is likely asking for the meaning and operational use of the German term "Beschäftigungsverhältnis" — i.e., a person’s employment relationship or employment status (employee vs. self‑employed, employer, unpaid family worker; contract type such as full/part‑time, permanent vs. temporary, formal vs. informal). They may also want to know how that variable is recorded in surveys and classifications (for example ESeC uses it together with ISCO08 job codes and occupational position to assign socio‑economic class, and caregiving surveys use it to identify whether and how care workers are employed and paid).	A document is relevant to the query "beschäftigungsverhältnis" if it explicitly discusses the type or status of employment relationships — for example distinctions between formal vs informal work, full‑time/part‑time, self‑employment vs employee status, or the variable "Art des Beschäftigungsverhältnisses" used in coding. Items that describe how employment-status information is collected or harmonized (e.g. ESeC/ISCO08 recoding rules, SPSS syntax, or survey questions about employment and payment of care workers) are directly useful. A document is not relevant if it only mentions employment in passing or focuses solely on a different topic (e.g. survey methodology like the Person Count Technique) without providing definitions, categories, or operationalization of employment relationships. Edge cases include texts that use synonymous terms ("Arbeitsverhältnis", "employment status", "Beschäftigung") — these are relevant if they contain the same operational detail — and materials in another language that quote the German variable name, which can be relevant for cross‑national coding.
56089	arbeitsleistung	The user is looking for a clear definition and explanation of the German term "Arbeitsleistung" (work performance/work output), including how it’s measured or calculated and its relevance in workplace, legal, or technical contexts. They may also want examples and practical ways to assess or improve employee productivity.	A document is relevant to the keyword "arbeitsleistung" if it explicitly discusses work performance or the amount of work delivered—e.g., HR guidance on employee performance evaluation, employment contract clauses about duties or performance-based pay, measurement methods for productivity, or German case law and statutes interpreting an employee’s duty to render Arbeitsleistung. Useful signals of relevance are the term appearing in the title or headings, presence of definitions, examples of how performance is measured (KPIs, output metrics), sample contract language, or citations of labor law (collective agreements, Betriebsvereinbarungen, court decisions). Non-relevant documents merely mentioning the word in passing, focusing on unrelated meanings (for example technical literature about electrical "Leistung" = power, or physics discussions of work and energy that don’t concern labor), or poor machine translations that garble context should be excluded. Edge cases include ambiguity between legal/HR intent and scientific usage, compound words or variants (e.g., "Erbringung der Arbeitsleistung", "Arbeitsleistungspflicht"), and documents in other languages — in those cases look for surrounding context (contract, employer/employee, KPIs, statute citations) to disambiguate relevance.
56749	antisemitism	A user searching "antisemitism" here is likely looking for survey items and methodological information about measuring antisemitic attitudes in German social surveys (e.g., the ZHPFGZ Cohesion Panel and ALLBUS). They want the actual question wordings (including English translations), details on cognitive pretesting methods used (web probing, face-to-face cognitive interviews), and findings about item comprehension and response difficulties.	Relevant documents explicitly treat antisemitism by defining it, presenting survey items or scales about antisemitic attitudes, reporting prevalence or trends, or describing the testing and adaptation of antisemitism questions (for example, cognitive pretests or Allbus evaluations of antisemitism items). Documents that only list antisemitism among many topics without giving item wordings, results, or measurement detail are less relevant because they do not enable assessment of how antisemitism was operationalized. Methodological reports about web probing or panel design are relevant only when they discuss the antisemitism items specifically; otherwise they are incidental. Edge cases include translated questionnaires or metadata-only datasets — these are useful if they preserve original German item wordings or provide clear variable descriptions, but are only partially relevant if they lack the actual items or results.
58154	gesundheitszustand	The user wants to know how the study measures "Gesundheitszustand" — specifically which survey items (self-rated health compared with peers, relative timing preferences for illness, and the estimated probability of using preventive care) are used to predict skin‑cancer screening decisions. They also want to know these items were pretested via face‑to‑face cognitive interviews (with simultaneous interpreters by video) in Serbian, Arabic, Farsi, Russian and English as part of the RESPOND project on asylum‑seeker care.	A document is relevant to the keyword gesundheitszustand if it explicitly addresses health status or measures of it — for example self-rated health, comparisons with peers, clinical condition, or survey items asking about one’s own health. The paragraph is relevant because it directly mentions “Einschätzung der eigenen Gesundheit im Vergleich mit Gleichaltrigen” and links preventive behavior (skin cancer screening) and perceived disease risk to respondents’ health perceptions. It would be non-relevant if the text only discusses unrelated topics (e.g., interpreter logistics, econometric methods, or general project administration) without content on health status. Edge cases include texts that do not use the German term but clearly measure health via screening uptake or risk-probability questions (still relevant), versus passages that mention the word only in passing or metaphorically (borderline or non-relevant).
60378	führungsstil	The query asks for a concise summary of the Leader–Member Exchange (LMX) scale as a measure of leadership style — developed by Graen and Uhl‑Bien (1995) from transactional leadership theory and grounded in dyadic social exchange (Dansereau et al., 1998) — and completed by employees. The LMX captures relationship quality (trust, respect, encouragement, affection) via two main dimensions (supervisor promotion of employee self‑worth and satisfactory employee performance) and subscales for affection, loyalty, professional respect and perceived engagement, using everyday item wording.	A document is relevant to the query "führungsstil" if it discusses leader–follower interaction patterns and measurement of leadership behavior, for example by describing the Leader–Member Exchange (LMX) scale, its dyadic focus, subscales (affection, loyalty, professional respect, perceived commitment), and core aspects such as trust, respect, encouragement and employee-rated items. Concrete signals of relevance are mention of Graen and Uhl-Bien (1995), the transactional leadership basis, that the questionnaire is completed by employees, or practical examples of how LMX captures differences in supervisory support and performance expectations. A document is non-relevant if it only uses the word "Führungsstil" in passing, treats leadership solely as administrative procedure, or focuses exclusively on unrelated topics (e.g., corporate policy or IT systems) without addressing interpersonal leadership patterns. Edge cases include psychometric validation papers (partially relevant if they discuss conceptual implications for leadership style, less so if they only report factor analyses) and translations or language-only descriptions that omit substantive links to leadership behavior.
6267	abtreibung	The user is seeking the specific legal paragraph(s) on abortion in German law (commonly §218 StGB), including the statutory text, what conduct is prohibited or permitted, applicable exceptions, penalties, and any procedural rules or recent legal changes.	Relevant documents explicitly address "Abtreibung" together with the legal paragraph or statutes that govern it (for example discussions of Germany’s §218 StGB), court decisions, official government guidance, medical protocols for lawful terminations, or scholarly/legal commentary that quotes or analyzes the specific paragraph. Examples of strong relevance are the text of the criminal code, explanatory notes from a health ministry, legal blogs that cite the paragraph number and its amendments, or news stories that explain how a particular paragraph was applied in a court case. Non-relevant documents merely use the term in passing, use "paragraph" in a typographic or editorial sense, discuss unrelated statutory paragraphs, or focus only on personal anecdotes without linking to legal text. Edge cases include historical or comparative pieces that mention an old version of the paragraph (relevant for context), translations that use "abortion" instead of "Abtreibung" (still relevant), and opinion pieces that reference the paragraph number but do not explain its content (partially relevant). Look for clear signals of legal citation, quoted statutory language, or authoritative sources to determine strong relevance.
6346	worklifebalance	The user is looking for how "work–life balance" is measured in the ISSP survey—specifically the work–family conflict items (work interfering with family and family interfering with work), their wording and scale. They also want methodological details about the German pretest (face‑to‑face cognitive interviews) and the fact that the documented items are English translations of original German questions with a link to the 2015 source questionnaireThis document is relevant because it explicitly discusses ISSP survey questions on work-life balance, working hours, and a four-item work–family conflict scale (measuring work interference with family and family interference with work), and notes that items were pretested in German and translated to English. It is especially useful when it contains the actual item wordings, details of the cognitive (face-to-face) pretests, or notes on measurement and validity, which researchers can use as examples of instrument construction. It would be non-relevant if the file only contains administrative history (e.g., ISSP membership growth), formatting metadata (font, style tags), or a brief passing mention without any substantive questions or scale information. Edge cases include documents that use the concatenated token "worklifebalance" or only mention related terms (e.g., “working hours”) without the conflict scale — these may be partially relevant but could be missed by strict exact‑match searches — and translations that do not match the original German wording, which are useful for context but may not substitute for the source items.
6501	homosexualität	A short informative paragraph that defines homosexuality — the pattern of romantic or sexual attraction to people of the same sex — and summarizes its social, cultural, and legal context. The user likely wants a concise, neutral explanation suitable for an essay, schoolwork, or general background.	A document is relevant to the keyword "homosexualität" if it substantially discusses homosexuality—its definitions, history, legal status, health issues, social attitudes, cultural representation, or policy debates—especially when written in German or using closely related terms like "homosexuality," "gay," "lesbisch," or "LGBT." Relevant examples include scholarly articles on the history of homosexuality in Germany, news reports about LGBT rights, advocacy pages, medical or psychological analyses, and law texts that explicitly address the status of homosexual people. A document is non-relevant if the term appears only incidentally (e.g., a single passing mention, a filename, or metadata), if the content is about an unrelated subject that only uses the word in a quote or list, or if the page is purely an image with no textual discussion. Edge cases include pornographic or hate sites that mention the term—these are topically relevant but may be low quality or unsafe—and documents that use compound or misspelled forms (e.g., "homosexualitätsdiskurs" or "homosexuality") which should still be considered relevant if the core topic matches. Title and heading mentions usually indicate higher relevance than brief body mentions, and translations or synonym-heavy pages should be evaluated for depth of coverage rather than keyword presence alone.
67543	flüchtling	The user is looking for information about refugees (Flüchtlinge), specifically research on improving healthcare and service structures for asylum seekers — in this case the RESPOND project at Heidelberg University Hospital, its goals to create evidence for more effective, efficient, and needs-based care, and the methods used (cognitive interviews in multiple languages with remote simultaneous interpreters).	A document is relevant to the keyword "Flüchtling" if it directly discusses refugees or asylum seekers (German: Flüchtlinge/Asylsuchende), their legal status, access to services (healthcare, housing, education), or policies and research aimed at improving their care. For example, the RESPOND paragraph is relevant because it explicitly targets Asylsuchende and describes a research project testing interview materials in multiple languages to improve healthcare provision. A document that only mentions migration broadly, tourists, or uses the string "flüchtig" in an unrelated sense would be non‑relevant, and reports that aggregate migrants without separating refugees may be only partially relevant. Edge cases include texts that use synonyms or foreign-language equivalents (refugee, refugiado, Schutzsuchende), studies of internally displaced persons or mixed-migrant flows (which can be relevant depending on scope), and methodological papers that include refugees as a minor subgroup rather than the main focus.
6763	psychotherapie	The user is looking for a concise overview of psychotherapeutic assessment instruments—particularly German-language questionnaires used to screen and quantify problems like health anxiety/hypochondria (Whiteley Index), pathological worry and GAD (PSWQ, Münsteraner Sorgenfragebogen), irritation/stress reactions, workaholism, and broad psychosocial traits (Giessen Test short scales). They likely want to know what each tool measures, how it’s structured and validated, and how it’s used clinically for screening, differential diagnosis, and treatment planning.	A document is relevant to the query "psychotherapie" if it discusses psychotherapeutic assessment, diagnosis, treatment planning, referral to therapy, intervention methods, or outcome monitoring — for example descriptions of instruments used to identify patients who need psychotherapy or to track symptom change during therapy. Psychometric descriptions become clearly relevant when they are tied to clinical decisions: the Whiteley Index’s use to detect hypochondriacal beliefs for referral to specialized treatment or the PSWQ’s role in identifying excessive worry as a target for CBT are directly pertinent. By contrast, purely technical validation studies, isolated scale item lists, or descriptions of somatic-sensory questionnaires that do not link findings to therapeutic action are less relevant. Edge cases include German-language instrument manuals (language does not reduce relevance), preventive screening tools that recommend interventions (relevant), and historical DSM citations that affect diagnostic criteria used in therapy (relevant), whereas instruments presented only for research or psychometric benchmarking without clinical application are borderline or non-relevant.
718	turkey	The user is seeking information about "turkey," an ambiguous term that could refer to the country Turkey, the bird (or its meat/dishes), or related topics like travel, history, recipes, or nutrition. They likely want concise facts, definitions, or practical guidance depending on which sense of the word they mean.	The single-word query "turkey" is ambiguous, so a relevant document clearly matches the intended sense — for example, a recipe describing roasting a turkey (including details like oven temperature and cooking time), an ornithology paper on Meleagris (wild or domesticated turkeys), or a travel advisory, history, or news piece about the country Turkey (capital Ankara, geopolitical coverage). Non-relevant documents either only mention "turkey" in passing or use unrelated senses or idioms (e.g., a sports article about a "turkey" in bowling, the phrase "turkey shoot," or an article about turkey vultures) that don’t match the user’s intent. Edge cases include documents using different spellings or languages (Türkiye, Turquía) that are still relevant to the country, pages about vegan substitutes like "tofurkey" which are only tangentially relevant to the bird, and scientific texts that use Latin names — these should be judged relevant if the surrounding context aligns with the user’s likely meaning. Finally, relevance depends on prominence and specificity: a page devoted to turkey topics is more relevant than a long article where "turkey" appears once without substantive information.
810	bildungsgrad	The user wants a clear definition and translation of the German term "Bildungsgrad"—i.e., the level or degree of education—along with how it is measured or classified and common contexts or synonyms where the term is used.	A document is relevant for the keyword "bildungsgrad" if it explicitly discusses a person's or group's educational level or attainment, such as descriptions of primary/secondary/tertiary education, years of schooling, degrees, qualifications, or survey statistics measuring education. Relevant examples include demographic studies reporting average bildungsgrad, CVs and application forms listing an applicant's bildungsgrad, policy papers on education levels, and datasets using ISCED codes or years of schooling as proxies. Documents are non-relevant when the word appears only once in passing, in unrelated boilerplate or metadata, as an OCR/artifact error, or in contexts where "grad" means degree/angle/temperature rather than education. Edge cases include texts using synonyms or translations ("educational level," "Schulabschluss") that are conceptually relevant despite not containing the exact keyword, and bilingual documents where the German term appears alongside an English explanation; these should be considered relevant if the educational concept is clearly addressed.
9616	politikverdrossenheit	The user is looking for a clear definition and overview of "Politikverdrossenheit" (political disaffection/cynicism), including its causes, consequences, and how it differs from related concepts. They also likely want information on how it is measured in surveys—e.g., the AUTNES short scale of political cynicism (KPZ)—and details about the scale’s theoretical basis and psychometric quality.	A document is relevant to the keyword "politikverdrossenheit" if it directly addresses political disaffection or cynicism — for example definitions, survey instruments (like the Kurzskala politischer Zynismus, KPZ), item wordings, sampling procedures, and psychometric results used to measure general mistrust of political authorities. Relevant examples include AUTNES reports describing the KPZ, papers evaluating its reliability and validity, or studies linking political cynicism to turnout and trust in institutions. Documents that discuss related constructs such as political apathy, alienation, or distrust can be partially relevant if they explicitly connect those concepts to measurement or to the same generalized skepticism toward officeholders. Non-relevant documents would be those that merely use the term metaphorically, focus on unrelated policy topics, or discuss cynicism in a purely philosophical or literary sense without empirical measurement. Edge cases include texts in other languages (German-language sources are often highly relevant), papers that only mention KPZ in passing, and studies that examine individual personality cynicism rather than system-directed politikverdrossenheit, which may be only tangentially useful.
