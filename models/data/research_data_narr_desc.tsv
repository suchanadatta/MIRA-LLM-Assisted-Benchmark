100	immigrant	The user seeks comprehensive surveys and datasets on immigrants and immigration in Germany and the EU, covering public attitudes, policy evaluation, skilled-worker migration, and immigrants’ integration and experiences, along with methodological and demographic details.	A document is relevant to the query “immigrant” if it primarily discusses immigrants or immigration, such as public attitudes to immigration in Germany, integration outcomes, skilled worker admission, asylum/deportation policy, or survey-based findings on immigrant groups (e.g., ENTRA, EU MIDIS II, SCIP). Materials that present methods and demographics specifically for immigrant populations (e.g., sampling Italians, Poles, Syrians, Turks; second-generation studies), or analyze immigrant experiences like language acquisition, discrimination, labor market access, or party positions on immigration, also count as relevant. Items become weakly relevant or non-relevant when “immigrant” appears only tangentially within broad topics (e.g., general environment or rail-service modules) or when the primary focus is the general population with only a passing variable about immigrants. Edge cases include documents about refugees/asylum seekers or second-generation migrants, which are usually relevant if they address immigrant integration or policy; historical migration studies (e.g., 17th–20th century Berlin) are relevant if they focus on immigrant groups rather than generic mobility. Conversely, pieces centered on emigration from a country, generic “migration” without specifying immigrants in the destination, or where “immigrant” appears only in metadata or a single manifesto bullet without substantive analysis, are likely non-relevant.
10109	politik	The query seeks survey-based resources on politics—primarily in Germany—covering media’s role and influence, journalist–politician relations, and public trust. It also spans attitudes toward democracy, parties and politicians, political participation (including women and nonvoters), election behavior, and demographic correlates.	For the query “politik,” a document is relevant if it substantively addresses politics or public policy—e.g., government institutions, parties, elections, media’s role in democracy, voter behavior, public opinion, or issues like equality and reunification. Content such as survey reports or codebooks detailing topics like media influence on political trust, party identification, non-voter motivations, democracy satisfaction, or attitudes toward politicians clearly qualifies. It is non‑relevant if “Politik” appears only as a passing term or in non-political senses, such as corporate “Firmenpolitik,” school rules, or product/brand names, or if the text is primarily methodological without political substance. Edge cases include documents where “Politik” appears inside compounds (e.g., Medienpolitik, Gleichstellungspolitik), which are still relevant, and materials in German that omit the exact keyword but cover synonymous topics (Regierung, Demokratie, Wahlen), which should be considered relevant despite keyword mismatches. Conversely, metadata or tag-only mentions of “Politik” with body text about unrelated topics would be marginal or non-relevant.
10418	politic	The query seeks surveys and datasets on political behavior and culture—covering post-election dynamics, trust in institutions, left-right orientations, participation, socialization, and the interplay between politics and media (including social media)—across various countries and groups (citizens, journalists, students, teachers). It aims to compile evidence on media influence, political communication, extremism, and related demographics/methods, including special cases like GDR political prisoner estimates and comparative election studies.	A document is relevant if it discusses politics in substance—e.g., elections, parties, voting behavior, left–right orientations, citizen trust in institutions, media influence on democracy, political communication, or policy debates—like the surveys on post-election developments, media’s role in politics, political participation, and attitudes toward extremism. Content analyzing political journalism, opinion polls, social media as a political information source, or historical topics such as political prisoners in the GDR also qualifies, as do demographic variables when they are tied to political attitudes or behavior. It may be borderline if it treats media use, education, or social engagement without a clear political link, or if “politic” only appears in coding fields or boilerplate without substantive political discussion. Non-relevant cases include uses of “politic” as an adjective meaning “prudent,” brand or platform names (e.g., Politico) without political content, or unrelated topics where “politic” occurs only as a substring or in tangential metadata. Edge cases include studies centered on students or women where politics is one section—these are relevant if they measure political interest, participation, or opinions, but not if they focus exclusively on non-political life conditions.
1112	politisches interesse	The user seeks survey data and research on political interest and participation, including measures like campaign/election interest, party identification, perceived efficacy, media use, socialization, and demographics. They are especially interested in gender differences (e.g., among women by education and East/West region) and perceptions of equality in Germany, with some comparative context.	A document is relevant if it explicitly measures or discusses political interest (politisches Interesse/Politikinteresse), such as self-assessed interest in politics, interest in election campaigns or outcomes, or the political interest of parents, and often ties this to media use, political discussions, or participation. Examples include surveys of women’s interest in different policy fields, student or youth studies tracking interest before/after major events, and datasets listing variables like interest in politics, campaign attention, or frequency of political information seeking. Proxies also count, such as indices or scales capturing political engagement, talk frequency about politics with family or peers, or intensity of consuming political news, even if the exact keyword appears only in variable labels. Non-relevant are texts where “Interesse” refers to non-political topics (e.g., music or TV genres without a political link) or to “interests” as group advantages (e.g., class or national interests) rather than an individual’s interest in politics. Edge cases include alternative phrasings (Interesse an Politik, politisches Interesse des Vaters), historical DDR/BRD contexts where “Interessen der Werktätigen” is not the target concept, and documents on participation that omit any measure or discussion of political interest.
1156	religion	The user seeks social survey datasets and variables on religion—affiliation, beliefs, practices—and how these relate to politics, values, voting, and demographics. The focus is largely Germany (censuses, ALLBUS, World Youth Day) with comparative international modules on church–state relations, moral issues, and societal attitudes.	A document is relevant to the query “religion” when it substantively addresses religious beliefs, practices, affiliations, or the social and political role of religion—for example, surveys on belief in God or an afterlife, church attendance, denominational membership, secularization trends, religious education, or the influence of churches on government and voting. Materials analyzing attitudes toward other faiths, acceptance of religious out-groups, World Youth Day participation and its impact, or religion–science tensions also clearly qualify. By contrast, content that only mentions “religion” in passing (e.g., as a single demographic checkbox, a variable label, or a venue name) without analysis, or discussions of politics and social issues that lack any explicit religious dimension, would be non-relevant. Edge cases include broad social surveys: they are relevant if they contain dedicated modules or multiple measures on religiosity (as in the examples listed), but only weakly relevant if religion appears as a minor, optional item. Similarly, datasets reporting legal church membership without addressing beliefs or practice may be relevant for affiliation queries but not for questions about lived religiosity or theology.
11910	persönlichkeit	The user seeks social survey data and analyses related to personality and personal identity, including the scales used and evaluations of personality traits across groups and nations. They are especially interested in findings from East/West German longitudinal studies linking personality to political interest, attitudes toward other nations, and life conditions.	A document is relevant if it contains the German keyword “Persönlichkeit” or close variants and uses it in context, such as personality traits, personal identity, or the portrayal/evaluation of persons. Clear hits include phrases like “persönliche Identität Skala,” “Bewertung von Persönlichkeits- und sozialen Eigenschaften,” “Darstellung der Persönlichkeit August Bebels,” or “Sympathie für politische Persönlichkeiten,” as they explicitly invoke the term. Non-relevant items are those discussing politics, media use, or demographics that never include the string or only use related adjectives like “persönliche” without the noun when exact-match retrieval is required. Edge cases include plural and compounds (e.g., “Persönlichkeiten,” “Persönlichkeitsentwicklung,” “Persönlichkeits-”), hyphenation or OCR breaks (“Persönlichkeits und sozialenEigenschaften”), and diacritic variants (“Persoenlichkeit,” “personlichkeit”). Also note the semantic ambiguity: references to “Persönlichkeiten” as notable figures are keyword matches but may be less relevant if the user intended personality-as-traits, whereas identity and personality-scale content is strongly on-target.
12195	persönlichkeitsmerkmale	The user is seeking information on personality traits—how they are defined and measured—and their relationships with political attitudes, education, health behaviors, and social integration. They appear interested in German surveys and longitudinal studies that assess personality characteristics and their development among students and youth, and how these traits relate to outcomes like academic success, career paths, and civic attitudes.	A document is relevant to the query “persönlichkeitsmerkmale” when it explicitly measures, analyzes, or reports personality traits (e.g., via named scales, item batteries, or self-assessments) rather than merely mentioning the term. Clear positives include surveys of students or workers that list “leistungsrelevante/studienrelevante Persönlichkeitsmerkmale,” Big-Five-like constructs, self-control/impulsivity, empathy, dogmatism or rigidity scales, and datasets (e.g., BIBB/BAuA follow-up, GLES modules, Values in Crisis) that contain dedicated personality items alongside demographics. Documents are only partially relevant when “Persönlichkeitsmerkmale” appears in a topic list without corresponding variables, measurement details, or results, or when traits are treated tangentially to broader themes such as ideology, study success, or health. They are non-relevant if the word is used in a non-psychological sense, if no trait constructs or measurements are present, or if content focuses solely on attitudes or behaviors without linking them to stable personality dimensions. Edge cases include DDR-era studies using compound phrases (e.g., leiterrelevante/studienrelevante Persönlichkeitsmerkmale) or synonyms like Eigenschaften/Persönlichkeitsentwicklung; these are relevant only when they clearly denote measured personality traits rather than vague character descriptions or expectations.
1259	sexuelle orientierung	The user seeks surveys and datasets on sexual orientation that capture experiences, attitudes, and behaviors of LGBTQ+ people—covering daily life, relationships, sexual practices, HIV/STI knowledge and prevention, discrimination, and social context—mainly in Germany and the EU. They want to identify relevant studies (e.g., EU LGBTI II, Eurobarometer) and the variables/questionnaire content for comparative analysis.	A document is relevant to “sexuelle Orientierung” if it explicitly treats sexual orientation—such as self-identification (heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual), patterns of attraction or behavior with same- or opposite-sex partners, coming out, or discrimination and social experiences tied to being LGBTI. Examples include survey modules asking for current heterosexual/homosexual orientation, men 16–65 being asked about sexual relations with men, studies on everyday problems of homosexuals or lesbians, or the EU FRA LGBTI II survey reporting on bias and violence due to sexual orientation. Non‑relevant would be materials focused only on AIDS/STI knowledge, condom use, contraception, or general “Wertorientierungen” (value orientations) without linking them to sexual orientation, as well as content about gender identity (trans/intersex) that omits orientation. Edge cases include texts where “Orientierung” means life values or school orientation sessions (false positives), and studies that don’t ask identity but allow inference via partner gender—these can still be relevant as proxies. German synonyms like sexuelle Identität or Ausrichtung, and modules restricted to subgroups (e.g., homosexuelle Männer, lesbische Frauen), also count as relevant even if the exact keyword appears sparsely.
12604	personal	The user seeks social survey datasets focused on personal attitudes, experiences, and behaviors in Germany and the EU. Topics span EU opinions, online privacy/data protection, political communication, social and family networks, religion, health and medication costs, fear of crime, and population displacement, with detailed demographics and survey metadata.	A document is relevant if “personal” refers to individual-level information, attitudes, experiences, or actions and is a central theme, such as protection of online personal data, willingness to provide personal information, personal financial shares for medications, political communication in the personal environment, or measures of personal identity, trust, devoutness, or health. For example, surveys about explicit personal approval before data processing, concerns about personal data being used without consent, personal net income, personal illness, or personal use of the internet would qualify. Documents are non-relevant when “personal” is absent, incidental, or merely lexical noise—e.g., tables about “persons” or “displaced persons,” uses of “personnel,” or broad population statistics that do not discuss personal-level issues. Edge cases include metadata mentions like “personal questionnaire” or single checklist items (e.g., “personal net income”) within a long, unrelated instrument; these are only weakly relevant unless the document substantively analyzes the personal dimension. Given the query’s breadth, prioritize documents where “personal” appears in titles/headings or repeatedly in core measures (e.g., personal data protection, personal trust/approval), and down-rank items where it is a minor attribute in an otherwise unrelated topic.
1293	alcohol	The query seeks survey-based information on alcohol use and attitudes, including consumption patterns, contexts, motives, perceived risks, and policy views, with demographic comparisons. It also covers related behaviors (smoking, drugs, drinking and driving) and health/social consequences, primarily in Germany and the EU across youth and adults.	A document is relevant to the query “alcohol” when it addresses beverage alcohol (ethanol) use, attitudes, risks, or policies—such as drinking frequency, types of drinks (beer, wine, spirits/schnapps/liqueurs), binge episodes, age at first drink or intoxication, motives and contexts for drinking, price sensitivity, warnings, alcoholism/dependence, treatment, or driving under the influence and legal blood alcohol limits. The paragraph is highly relevant because it details surveys on Germans’ and youths’ alcohol consumption patterns, preferred beverages, comparisons to peers, reactions to non-alcoholic options, knowledge of alcoholics, perceived dangers, susceptibility, and policy views (e.g., under‑18 sales bans, advertising restrictions, and random police checks). Mixed-topic health or lifestyle datasets are also relevant if they include substantive alcohol variables (e.g., last-week quantities, household alcohol supply, frequency of 5+ drinks, DUI behavior or knowledge of legal limits). Non-relevant items are those where “alcohol” appears only tangentially or chemically (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, rubbing alcohol, ingredient lists) or materials focused solely on tobacco/drugs without meaningful alcohol measures. Edge cases include documents on non-alcoholic beverages, organ donation, or general health screening that qualify only if they contain specific alcohol consumption or attitude data; synonyms and related terms like intoxication, blood alcohol, alcoholism, dependency, and sobriety also indicate relevance.
1326	demokratie	The user seeks survey datasets and studies on democracy—primarily in Germany—covering evaluations of democratic performance, party preferences, institutional trust, populist attitudes, EU integration, and civic participation, with rich demographic detail. The resources span public and elite samples and include cross-national modules (e.g., CSES) to analyze attitudes and voting behavior over time.	A document is relevant if it substantively treats democracy (Demokratie) as a system or value—examining satisfaction with democracy, democratic principles and rights, institutional trust, the functioning of the political system, or citizens’/elites’ attitudes toward it. Examples include surveys assessing the Grundgesetz, links between democracy and the social market economy, preferences for representative versus direct democracy, fears and threats to democracy, EU integration and federalism as they affect democratic governance, or how populism shapes attitudes and voting in democracies. Documents are non-relevant if they only name-check “Demokratie,” list demographics without connecting them to democratic attitudes, or focus on unrelated topics (e.g., pure economics, lifestyle, or sports) with no democracy analysis. Edge cases include multi-topic datasets where democracy is one module—these are relevant if that module is substantive; historical comparisons (Weimar, Nationalsozialismus) or party preference data are relevant only when tied to democratic norms, performance, or satisfaction. German compounds such as Demokratiezufriedenheit qualify, and cross-national studies of “new democracies” or elite interviews are relevant when they analyze implications for democratic development, quality, or behavior.
13621	kultur	The user is seeking research datasets and survey information about culture and cultural participation. Topics span Sorbian culture in Lusatia and comparative public-opinion studies on cultural values, EU relations and cooperation, institutional trust, immigration and prejudice, media use, and related demographics.	A document is relevant to the query “kultur” if it substantively discusses culture, such as customs, festivals, language use, cultural policy, arts participation, heritage, or cultural institutions. Examples include material on Sorbian customs and language in Lusatia, attendance at theaters or cinemas, preferred venues for cultural events, EU-related cultural exchange, or analyses of “political culture” and “kulturelle Werte.” Statistical surveys or datasets are also relevant when they contain dedicated sections on culture and the arts (e.g., cultural activities, media habits, institutions, funding, or attitudes toward culture), even if embedded among broader topics. A document is non-relevant when “kultur” appears only incidentally or in an unrelated sense (e.g., biological cultures, agriculture, or a passing mention in a list where culture is not treated in depth). Edge cases to include as relevant are German compounds and variants like Kulturveranstaltungen, kulturell, Kultur und Kunst, and politische Kultur, as well as English or other-language equivalents of “culture.”
14255	konsum	The user is seeking resources on “Konsum” (consumption) in Germany, including datasets and studies on historical private income/consumption time series, consumer and media behavior, and substance use (alcohol, tobacco, drugs, medications). They also want research on sustainable consumption (SDG 12) and micro-level analyses such as household Christmas spending.	A document is relevant if it contains the German term “Konsum” or clear compounds and inflections that include it, such as privater Konsum (macro consumption), Konsumverhalten, Alkoholkonsum, Tabakkonsum, Drogenkonsum, or nachhaltiger Konsum, especially when providing measures, time series, surveys, or analyses (e.g., private consumption indices 1851–1913 or CATI surveys on SDG 12 consumer behavior). Studies on consumer lifestyles, brand consciousness, media consumption, or household expenditure that explicitly use “Konsum-” compounds also match the query. Documents are non-relevant if they discuss adjacent topics (income, health, or media use) without mentioning “Konsum,” or if they only use synonyms like Verbrauch/Verbraucherverhalten without the keyword. Edge cases include “Konsum” as a proper noun (retail co-ops like Konsum Leipzig), archaic or variant forms (Konsumtion/Consum), or hits limited to metadata or classification codes; these may be marginally relevant depending on the search’s literal vs. semantic intent.
1537	social media	The user is seeking empirical studies and datasets on social media use—its frequency, platforms, purposes, and user attitudes—and its societal and political impacts. Focus areas include language and identity, political information behavior, hate speech and disinformation, media trust, and social cohesion, primarily in Germany with some cross-national comparisons, including details on methods and demographics.	A document is relevant to the query “social media” when it substantially discusses social networking platforms, their use, behaviors, impacts, or policies—for example, surveys of intensive social media users, frequency of use of Facebook/Instagram/Twitter/YouTube/WhatsApp, political information behavior on social networks, hate speech, regulation, or social media strategies and follower analytics for blogs/podcasts. Content on scientists’ use of Web 2.0 tools (e.g., Twitter, wikis, Mendeley, Zotero), learning with social networks in education, or studies like ValCon examining digital social news media and polarization is also clearly relevant. Material becomes only weakly relevant if it treats “media” broadly but still analyzes disinformation, credibility, or political engagement specifically on social platforms; it is non-relevant when limited to traditional media (radio/TV/print) without a connection to social networks, such as GDR-era media habits or Yugoslav broadcast coverage. Edge cases include using synonyms like “social networks” instead of “social media,” counting specific platform names even without the term “social media,” and excluding methodological terms like “online interviews/CAWI,” which are not topical. Overall, this paragraph is highly relevant because it repeatedly and explicitly covers social media use across populations and contexts, though some historical/traditional-media sections are outside scope.
15423	jugendliche	The user is seeking comprehensive research data and surveys on adolescents in Germany, spanning sexuality, wellbeing, media/social media use, migration and integration, leisure, substance use, violence, legal status, political attitudes, and educational outcomes. They also want details on samples, methods, and time frames across these studies.	A document is relevant if it centers on adolescents (Jugendliche) as the subject, uses the exact term or close synonyms (Kinder und Jugendliche, Teenager, Heranwachsende, junge Menschen), and/or specifies youth age bands such as 12–19, 14–17, or 14–18. Clear examples include surveys of youth sexuality (14–17), wellbeing studies of 7th/9th graders, media-use research on 12–19-year-olds, datasets on the living situation of foreign youths, or legal/statistical tables that explicitly break out categories labeled “Jugendliche.” Documents are non-relevant if “jugendliche” appears only incidentally while the main focus is adults or the general population, if it is purely historical/legal background without youth-focused analysis, or if the adjective is used in unrelated senses (e.g., jugendliche Mode, Jugendstil). Edge cases include materials on “junge Erwachsene” (18–25) or “Heranwachsende” (18–21), which are only relevant when adolescents are included or compared, and parent-focused content that remains relevant if it reports outcomes or behaviors of the youths themselves. Morphological variants (Jugendlicher, Jugendlichen) and compounds (Kinder und Jugendliche, Jugendzentrum) can also indicate relevance when the content concerns adolescents’ experiences, services, or measurements.
1552	religiosität	The query seeks studies and survey data on religiosity—beliefs, practices, and self-assessed spirituality—and how it relates to attitudes toward death, politics, socialization, and demographics. It points to German (and some comparative, e.g., Cologne–Tokyo) datasets across students, youth, and the general population.	A document is relevant if it explicitly treats religiosity as a topic or measure, such as reporting church attendance, frequency of prayer or Bible reading, self-rated religiosity, belief in God or an afterlife, spiritual feelings, or the importance of following religious rules. It is also relevant when religiosity appears as a demographic or scale within broader surveys of politics or society, provided it is actually measured or analyzed—for example, items on Kirchgangshäufigkeit, Beten, Freitagsgebet, adherence to Islamic prescriptions, belief in angels/demons, astrology, or readiness to proselytize. Documents that only mention “Religiosität” in passing (e.g., a lone variable name in a long list) without describing content, methods, or findings are weakly relevant, while pieces focused solely on unrelated topics like housing or party preferences with no religious measures are non-relevant. Edge cases include spelling/umlaut variants (Religiositaet), synonyms like spirituality, or constructs like “thinking about religion” or “divine messages,” which can still qualify; by contrast, texts that reference churches or clergy historically but never address personal religiosity as a trait or practice may not satisfy the query. German-language sections that enumerate detailed religiosity batteries (e.g., frequency of thinking about religion, feelings of divine intervention, or missionizing readiness) strongly match the intent of the query.
15640	karriere	The user is seeking comprehensive information and datasets on career development and trajectories in Germany—especially academic careers but also other professions—covering stages of advancement, education, exams, employment, social origin, gender, and work–life balance from historical to contemporary periods. The goal is to understand determinants of career progression, mobility, and outcomes.	A document is relevant if it uses “Karriere” in the sense of professional or academic career paths, stages, determinants, or outcomes—for example, handbooks on academic careers in Prussia/Germany (1850–1945) describing Karrierestufen like study duration, exams, promotions/habilitation/professorships, surveys on work and career (career goals, mobility, job market), or studies of journalists’ and politicians’ career trajectories. Mentions via compounds and synonyms (beruflicher Werdegang, Laufbahn, Karrierechancen, Karrierebedingungen) and operational indicators (appointments, tenure, publications, mentoring, labor market status) also make it relevant, including analyses of family–career balance or discrimination affecting careers. It is non-relevant when “karriere” appears only as a navigation label, boilerplate, a brand/name, or a passing mention without describing career development, or when used metaphorically unrelated to employment. Edge cases like content about sacrificing or interrupting a career, historical lists of promotions and professorships, or evaluation of journals’ impact on reputation and career remain relevant because they analyze career conditions and outcomes. Conversely, pages that merely enumerate unrelated topics where “karriere” occurs once without context, or contain only administrative metadata, would be non-relevant.
15721	job	The user seeks comprehensive survey data on employment and job market conditions—types of employment, working hours, income/taxes/social security, side jobs, and unemployment. They also want evidence on job-related mobility (commuting, travel, relocations) and its causes and impacts on well-being, family life, career progression, job satisfaction/stress, union attitudes, automation, and gender equality, with demographic breakdowns.	For the query “job,” a document is relevant when it primarily addresses employment and work-related themes such as employment status, job mobility, working hours, pay/benefits, job search and unemployment, job satisfaction, and workplace conditions. Examples include surveys detailing side jobs and their taxation, commuting or overnight travel for work and relocations made for job reasons, occupational histories and promotions, union membership and works council issues, or sector-specific job markets (e.g., journalists). Content about job-creation programs and retraining, temporary or part-time contracts (including rules like “50 days or 2 months per year”), the effects of automation on job stress, or variables like gross income from a primary job and social-security contributions also matches. Documents are non-relevant if “job” appears only incidentally or in another sense (e.g., the biblical Job or computing batch jobs), or if the focus is on unrelated domains (family, religion, health) without substantive links to employment. Edge cases include broad social surveys: they remain relevant when they contain substantial employment modules (even if mixed with other topics) and when they use near-synonyms such as occupation, work, or employment; however, pieces that mention jobs only in passing within a long list of unrelated variables may be borderline.
15758	job satisfaction	The user seeks survey-based research on job satisfaction and its determinants, including working conditions, pay, hours, job security, mobility, company characteristics, and unionization. It also encompasses demographic breakdowns and related attitudes (e.g., retraining, co-determination, equal opportunities), with emphasis on German contexts such as changes around unification.	A document is relevant if it explicitly measures or analyzes job, work, or occupational satisfaction, including named scales (e.g., the SAZ short form) or items like wage satisfaction, satisfaction with job security, promotion prospects, workplace atmosphere, or relationships with colleagues and superiors; examples include surveys of coal and steel employees, EDP users, central Hesse workers, machine fitters, and working mothers. Studies that link job satisfaction to determinants such as wage systems and bonuses, working hours and shift work, commuting distance and costs, company size, co-determination, union membership, retraining, or compare satisfaction across periods (e.g., before/after German unification) or groups (retrainees, guest workers, farmers) are also clearly relevant. Documents where job satisfaction appears as one module within broader quality-of-life surveys remain relevant if they contain a distinct job satisfaction scale or items tied to employment. Non-relevant materials focus only on non-job domains (life or housing satisfaction, neighborhood/yard satisfaction, consumer habits, politics) or discuss employment factors (wages, job security, mobility, training) without any evaluative satisfaction component. Edge cases: synonyms like work satisfaction, occupational satisfaction, satisfaction with choice of occupation, and wage satisfaction should count; student surveys are relevant only when they include post-study or employment-related job satisfaction, not merely satisfaction with study conditions.
1635	depression	The query seeks studies and datasets related to “depression,” including mental health depression measured in German surveys of youth and adults (stress, bullying, unemployment, substance use, PHQ/FPI scales) and analyses of the economic Great Depression in interwar Germany. It aims to identify where and how depression is assessed or discussed across these social science and historical sources.	A document is relevant to “depression” if it substantively addresses psychological depression—its symptoms, measurement, prevalence, correlates, or treatment—including synonyms and operationalizations such as depressive symptoms, melancholy/hopelessness, PHQ scales, FPI depression subscales, suicidal ideation, or use of antidepressants. For example, surveys that record depressive symptoms among youths, PHQ depression tendencies, depressive moods in workplace health modules, or adult health surveys listing diagnosed depression and related complaints are clearly on-topic. It is also relevant when “depression” denotes an economic depression, such as analyses of Germany’s Great Depression, banking crises, wage dynamics, or policy responses framed explicitly as “the depression.” By contrast, documents are weakly or non-relevant if “depression” appears only as a fleeting item in a long variable list without discussion, or if the focus is on politics, education, or religiosity with no substantive treatment of depression. Edge cases include scale labels (e.g., FPI “depression”) or phrases like “depressive moods,” which count as relevant, whereas unrelated usages (e.g., geographic or meteorological depressions, or words like “depressurization”) do not.
16523	klimaschutz	The query seeks datasets and reports on German public attitudes toward climate change and climate protection, including views on the Energiewende, responsibility of actors, personal behaviors, and evaluations of specific measures (e.g., CO2 pricing, speed limits, EV incentives, GEG). It specifically looks for methodology, demographics, and time trends (2021–2024) from recurring CATI dual-frame surveys by Kantar/Verian and related German Internet Panel modules.	A document is relevant to “klimaschutz” if it substantively addresses climate protection—policies, measures, or public attitudes aimed at reducing emissions—such as CO2 pricing/abgabe, subsidies for energy‑efficient retrofits and heating, electric‑vehicle incentives and charging, speed limits, kerosene taxes, coal phase‑out, or progress in the Energiewende. Survey reports are relevant when they measure who should act (government, industry, utilities, consumers), familiarity with initiatives (e.g., Klimakabinett), or expected impacts on prices and sectors like mobility, energy, buildings, and agriculture. Content about climate change risks, extreme weather, or floods is relevant if it links to mitigation or protection actions; broad environmental or health topics are only borderline unless tied to greenhouse‑gas reduction. Non‑relevant documents focus solely on demographics or sampling methods, cover unrelated policies (health system, pensions, smartphone habits) without a climate connection, or mention “Klimaschutz” only in passing without discussing concrete measures. Edge cases include mobility or tourism pieces (e.g., Germanyticket, flying less) that become relevant when framed around emission cuts, and EU‑level discussions (lobbying, legal enforcement) that are pertinent when they address the EU’s climate‑protection stance.
1670	rassismus	The user is seeking research and survey data on racism in Germany, focusing on public perceptions and lived experiences—particularly among people with migration backgrounds—and the prevalence of related prejudices (xenophobia, antisemitism, Islamophobia). They also want contextual measures such as media coverage, trust in institutions and police, evaluations of anti-racism policies, social integration, and demographic/political correlates.	A document is relevant to the query “rassismus” when it directly examines racism—such as perceptions and lived experiences of racial discrimination, attitudes toward minorities, or policy responses—especially in concrete contexts like post–George Floyd debates in Germany. Materials that operationalize racism via surveys or scales, or that analyze related constructs (e.g., Fremdenfeindlichkeit, xenophobia, Islamophobia, antisemitism) as part of a broader racism framework, also count as relevant; for example, questionnaires asking about racist prejudices in daily life, trust in police, and evaluation of anti-racism policies. Content analyses of media coverage of “Ausländer” are relevant when they code or interpret racist framing, language, or portrayals. By contrast, documents that only list “Rassismus” among many tags without substantive treatment, or that focus solely on economics, EU governance, or demographics without linking them to racism, are non-relevant. Edge cases include formal coding schemes or topic lists: they are relevant if they include and use “Rassismus” items in analysis, but borderline if they merely enumerate categories without examining racist content or effects.
17057	kinderbetreuung	The user seeks information on childcare in Germany: types and availability of care, responsibilities of providers (municipal vs. state), costs/support, and impacts on parents’ employment, gender roles, and family life. They may also want survey-based evidence on how childcare arrangements changed during policy shifts or crises such as COVID-19.	For the query “kinderbetreuung,” documents are relevant if they address childcare services, arrangements, or policies—such as availability and types of care (Kita, daycare, preschool, after-school care, childminders), parental leave and division of care, costs/subsidies, usage and satisfaction, or impacts on parents’ employment and time allocation. Studies that examine municipal responsibility for childcare, family support networks (e.g., grandparents’ care), or COVID-era changes in children’s care and schooling are also relevant, as are time-use diaries that quantify hours spent on childcare. Documents become less relevant when “Betreuung” refers to groups other than children (e.g., elder or healthcare support), or when childcare is only listed among many topics without substantive discussion, methods, findings, or policy detail. Edge cases that still count include broader family-policy pieces comparing cash benefits versus expansion of childcare, household expenditure sections that include childcare spending, or education-focused texts that cover supervision and care outside teaching hours. Synonyms and near-terms such as daycare, nursery, Kita, childminding, babysitting, or “Betreuungssituation” for children should be treated as relevant signals.
1719	vertrauen	The user is seeking survey-based research on trust (Vertrauen) across politics, society, and technology—public trust in governments, institutions (e.g., NATO/EU, courts, police), media, and platforms—and its determinants and effects. Emphasis is on how trust shapes acceptance of COVID-19 measures, welfare and security policies, and data sharing/privacy under GDPR, drawing on sources like Eurobarometer and the World Values Survey.	A document is relevant to the query “vertrauen” when it treats trust as a central concept—measuring, analyzing, or explaining trust (e.g., public trust in government, politicians, institutions like NATO/EU/UN, mass media, or generalized social trust) and its consequences, such as acceptance of COVID-19 measures or willingness to share data with apps. Survey-based materials that include explicit “Vertrauen in …” variables, indices from Eurobarometer or World Values Survey (general trust, institutional trust), or models linking trust to behaviors (e.g., technology acceptance, policy support) are strongly relevant. By contrast, texts that only mention the word in passing (e.g., “vertrauensbildende Maßnahme” without measuring trust), lists of names or topics without trust-related analysis, or discussions of security/military issues that do not assess trust are weakly or non-relevant. Edge cases include inverse formulations like “Misstrauen” (often still relevant), ambiguous uses such as parliamentary “Vertrauensfrage” (relevant only if about citizens’ trust, not procedural votes), and non-social meanings of trust (legal “Treuhand,” cryptographic trust stores, or statistical “confidence”) which are non-relevant. German-language documents spanning multiple domains can be relevant as long as trust is a key variable rather than a incidental term.
1743	lebenszufriedenheit	The user is looking for surveys and datasets that measure life satisfaction (Lebenszufriedenheit) and related domains, primarily in Germany (e.g., Hamburg, Cologne, migrant populations) with some comparative European coverage, to support empirical analysis of its determinants and trends.	A document is relevant if it measures, analyzes, or reports on Lebenszufriedenheit (life satisfaction), either as an overall rating or via a specific scale, and may include related domain satisfactions (e.g., income, health, housing) used to assess general life satisfaction. Clear examples include survey or dataset descriptions listing “Allgemeine Lebenszufriedenheit,” “Skala Lebenszufriedenheit,” or modules on life satisfaction within broader studies (e.g., Hamburg BUS, Eurobarometer, integration or migration surveys that ask about life satisfaction). Documents are non-relevant if they only address narrow satisfactions like Wohnzufriedenheit or Arbeitszufriedenheit without linking to overall life satisfaction, or if “Lebenszufriedenheit” appears only in boilerplate metadata with no substantive measurement or discussion. Edge cases: texts using German synonyms like Wohlbefinden or Glück, or English “life satisfaction,” are relevant if they clearly refer to the construct; multi-topic political or social surveys remain relevant when they contain a life satisfaction item or scale. Conversely, general political commentary or historical overviews that merely list the term without data, variables, or findings on life satisfaction should be treated as non-relevant.
17717	kinderwunsch	The user seeks surveys and analyses on childbearing intentions (Kinderwunsch)—ideal number and timing of children, and reasons for or against (further) children—along with how partnership dynamics, work–family balance, housing, social policies, and socio-demographics shape these choices. They also want subgroup perspectives (women, men, youth, academics) and related outcomes such as parenting, career impacts, and living conditions.	A document is relevant to the query “kinderwunsch” when it directly addresses fertility intentions or desire for children, for example discussing the ideal number of children, preferred timing of births, reasons for or against having a first or additional child, and the alignment of partners’ wishes. Highly relevant examples include survey modules on “Kinderwunsch der Befragten und des Partners,” “ideales Alter für das erste Kind,” “Gründe gegen die Realisierung eines weiteren Kinderwunsches,” or assessments of how social policies, childcare, career paths, and housing space affect deciding for or postponing children. Content on work–family balance, financial strain, health, or migration is also relevant if it explicitly links these factors to wanting children or fulfilling a child wish. By contrast, material that only covers housing, EU policy, general health checks, or employment conditions without tying them to fertility intentions, or that merely counts existing children without asking about desired children, is non-relevant. Edge cases include documents that mention “Kinderwunsch” only as a tag in a long topic list with no substantive detail, or pieces focused solely on parenting after birth; these are weakly or non-relevant unless they analyze the desire for future children or motives for childlessness.
1817	mediennutzung	The user seeks data and research on media usage in Germany—what media people use, how often, and how patterns have changed over time (e.g., linear vs non-linear, online/offline). They likely want time-series trends, cross-media comparisons, demographic breakdowns, and key sources such as the ARD/ZDF Media Study (including 2024).	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses Mediennutzung (media usage) as behaviors or metrics—e.g., time spent, frequency, platforms (TV, radio, print, online, social), linear vs non-linear use, and demographic or trend analyses. Clear examples include survey reports like the ARD/ZDF Medienstudie, AGMA’s Media-Analyse, or municipal studies (e.g., Hamburg BUS) that quantify daily media time and compare usage across channels or years. Documents that merely list “Mediennutzung” among many topics without presenting findings, or that primarily discuss other themes (politics, environment, values) with no substantive usage data, are marginal or non-relevant. Edge cases: pieces about “media” in art or IT (e.g., storage media usage) or purely methodological notes without usage results are not relevant; by contrast, works using synonyms such as media consumption, media reception, or social media usage remain relevant if they analyze user behavior. Because the query is German, German-language or Germany-focused studies are especially pertinent, but comparative or international analyses that explicitly examine Mediennutzung also qualify.
1825	glaubwürdigkeit	The user seeks survey measures and findings on credibility (Glaubwürdigkeit)—how people rate the trustworthiness of media, social networks, government communications, political parties, and institutions. They want data across multiple German studies and events, including Chernobyl, COVID-19, and the Ukraine war.	A document is relevant if it directly measures or discusses credibility (Glaubwürdigkeit) of information or actors, for example “Glaubwürdigkeit der Informationen der Bundesregierung zur Corona-Krise,” “Glaubwürdigkeit sozialer Medien,” or comparisons of media credibility (newspapers vs radio/TV, Voice of America, etc.). It also counts when credibility is evaluated in specific contexts, such as risk communication after Chernobyl, credibility of political parties or leaders (e.g., SED/PDS), or credibility of sources about the Ukraine war. Documents that merely describe media usage, political preferences, or demographic variables without assessing credibility are non-relevant. Edge cases include credibility in entertainment contexts (e.g., “Glaubwürdigkeit der Probleme” in a TV series) or institutional reputation ratings; these match the keyword but may be less useful if the intent is credibility of news/information sources. Synonyms and variants like trust/trustworthiness, reliability, veracity, glaubwürdig/unglaubwürdig should be treated as relevant, while hits only in metadata, headers, or boilerplate without substantive discussion are not.
18263	mitarbeiter	The user seeks information and survey data related to employees/staff, including their attitudes, motivation, participation in decision-making, working conditions and safety, and organizational climate. They are likely looking for studies on employee involvement and support mechanisms such as profit/capital sharing, training, and workplace literacy within companies and institutions.	A document is relevant if it centers on employees or staff in organizations—e.g., topics like employee participation and motivation, profit or capital sharing for employees, works councils and employee representatives, functional illiteracy among workers, leadership styles toward subordinates, workplace safety and health, or organizational climate as perceived by employees. Synonyms and compounds count, such as Beschäftigte, Arbeitnehmer, Belegschaft, Personal, as well as Mitarbeiter‑ compounds (Mitarbeiterbeteiligung, Mitarbeiterbefragung) and phrases like unterstellte Mitarbeiter. Content about volunteer “Mitarbeiter” (e.g., church or community staffers) can be relevant when they function as staff members, but mere “Mitarbeit” (collaboration/volunteering) without the person noun is weakly relevant. Not relevant are hits where “Mitarbeiter” means “co-authors” (e.g., “v. Rosenstiel und Mitarbeitern”) or documents focused on unrelated themes (theology students, youth law education, family socialization, general innovation policy) without a staff/employee angle. Edge cases: documents on OSH or employer–employee surveys remain relevant even if they use Beschäftigte/Arbeitnehmer instead of the exact token “Mitarbeiter,” whereas purely demographic sections with no workforce context are not.
1851	education	The user wants datasets and studies on education that cover both historical public spending and its links to economic growth and contemporary participation in and attitudes toward adult/continuing education. The focus is primarily on Germany (including the former GDR) with international comparisons, and includes surveys on education policy preferences and detailed demographic variables.	A document is relevant when it substantively addresses education systems, learning participation, or education policy—such as analyses of public expenditure on education (e.g., Germany, France, Spain, Great Britain 1815–1989), surveys of adult and further education (AES 2022), evaluations of distance education, or public preferences for education spending and governance (INVEDUC). Content focused on educational structures and pathways (schooling, vocational training, higher education), lifelong learning and upskilling, teacher professional development, or historically specific systems (e.g., GDR school and higher education data in HISTAT) is also clearly relevant. By contrast, documents are non-relevant if “education” appears only as a demographic attribute (“highest education attained”), a passing mention, or in an organization’s name without substantive analysis of education. Edge cases include mixed-topic surveys or fiscal datasets that cover multiple sectors: they are relevant if they report dedicated education modules or indicators (e.g., education-specific tables, attitudes to further education), but only marginally relevant if education is incidental (e.g., a labor study that merely records schooling or a hobby “self-education” note without links to broader educational behavior).
18589	migranten	The user seeks empirical datasets and studies on migrants, including international migration flows, demographic and occupational profiles, employment before/after migration, and return migration. They also want surveys on integration and public attitudes toward migrants, with emphasis on Germany and comparative international contexts across historical and contemporary periods.	A document is relevant to the query “migranten” if it substantively discusses migrants as people who move across borders, including their demographics (age, sex, education), occupations, integration experiences, or measured flows, and if it presents statistics, surveys, or policies about them. Clear examples include datasets on Arbeitsmigranten in households, national tables of emigrants and immigrants by origin/destination and occupation, or panel studies of second-generation migrants, returnees, and their life-course outcomes. Texts using closely related German terms such as Zuwanderer, Auswanderer, Rückwanderer, Personen mit Migrationshintergrund, or studies of “Migration” that identify individual migrants (e.g., harbor/passport/border statistics distinguishing migrants from travelers) are also relevant. Non-relevant materials include uses of “Migration” in unrelated domains (IT/database migration, animal migration), or documents where “Migranten” is only a passing mention without data or analysis about migrant persons. Edge cases include colonial/intercontinental vs international classifications and “indirect” statistics (e.g., counts by referenced countries); these remain relevant if they quantify or describe migrants, whereas items that list migrants merely as one of many possible target groups without depth are only marginally relevant.
18995	migrant	Find social science surveys and datasets about migrants and migration, including profiles of migrant workers and their families, migration histories and return, integration experiences, socioeconomic outcomes, and public attitudes toward migrants across countries.	A document is relevant if it centers on people who migrate—e.g., migrant workers, emigrants/remigrants, returned migrants, or second-generation migrants—and provides substantive information about their demographics, movements, work, integration, or impacts. Examples include surveys detailing age, education, employment before and during migration, length and type of migration, return timing, household roles of wives of returned migrant workers, and case studies such as small farming families in Zambia, GERPS panels of German emigrants/remigrants, or the 2000 Families study of Turkish migrants. Studies on attitudes toward migrants (xenophobia, discrimination, integration policy), or panels of new immigrants like SCIP, are also clearly relevant because migrants are the focal subject. Non-relevant items would be those where “migration” refers to non-human or technical processes (e.g., data or bird migration) or where migrants are only name-checked without substantive content. Edge cases include documents focused solely on “refugees” or general social conditions: they can be relevant if they explicitly link to migrants or migration experiences, but may be borderline for a strict keyword match on “migrant.”
20168	muslime	The user is seeking social science surveys and datasets about Muslims, focusing on public attitudes toward Muslims and Islam, Islamophobia, interreligious contact, integration, identity, and discrimination, mainly in Germany and Europe. They want empirical measures alongside demographics and political views to analyze these topics.	A document is relevant to the query “muslime” if it contains substantive information about Muslims, such as attitudes toward Muslims, contact with Muslim neighbors or coworkers, measures of Islamophobia, policies or opinions about Muslim immigrants, or demographics of Muslim populations. Examples include survey modules on “Respekt/Sympathie für Muslime,” “Gefühl der Fremdheit wegen der vielen Muslime,” headscarf policies, “Nachbarschaft ohne Muslime bevorzugt,” implicit attitude tests toward Muslims, or variables distinguishing Muslim religious affiliation. Content in broader interfaith or immigration studies is also relevant when Muslims are an explicitly analyzed subgroup (e.g., interreligious contact with Muslim and Christian participants in Togo/Sierra Leone, or European opinions on Muslim immigrants), and language or morphological variants (Muslime, Muslimen, muslimische, MuslimInnen) count. A document is non-relevant if it discusses religion or migration only in general terms without Muslim-specific measures, or mentions Muslims only in passing (e.g., a brief note about papal meetings) without analytic detail. Edge cases include geographically outside-Germany contexts (still relevant if Muslims are a focus) and tangential mentions that become relevant only when tied to concrete variables, outcomes, or policy stances about Muslims.
20775	mobilität	The user is seeking research and survey-based information on “Mobilität” in both senses: social/occupational mobility (inter- and intragenerational, sectoral, regional) and transport/commuting behavior. They want definitions and typologies, determinants and impacts (careers, wellbeing, integration), and public attitudes and policy measures (e.g., e-mobility, public transport), with emphasis on Germany and Europe.	For the query “mobilität,” documents are relevant if they explicitly address mobility in any German sense—transport/mobility behavior (commuting, mode choice, e-mobility), occupational or job mobility (career moves, sector switches, relocations), regional/geographical mobility (migration, urban–rural moves), or social/intergenerational mobility—using the term or close variants like E‑Mobilität, berufliche/regionale Mobilität, or Jobmobilität. Highly relevant examples include surveys of car commuters’ behavior and attitudes to future mobility, studies of inter- and intragenerational occupational mobility, EU labor mobility within the single market, or datasets measuring commuting distance/time, overnight work travel, and job-related moves. Historical or local studies that analyze vertical mobility between parents’ and children’s occupations, or city surveys where mobility is a core topic among others, are also relevant. Non-relevant items would be texts where “Mobilität” is merely a passing tag with no substantive analysis, or where the string matches unrelated topics (e.g., Immobilien/property, “Immobilität”/immobility, mobile phones). Edge cases include documents using synonyms like Pendeln or räumliche/soziale Durchlässigkeit without the exact keyword, or pieces mixing several mobility types; these are relevant if mobility is central rather than incidental.
21196	motivation	The user seeks surveys and datasets examining motivation, motives, and related attitudes across many life domains (e.g., abortion counseling, education and career choice, migration, military service, leisure and museum visits, language learning, gaming, drug use, leadership, residential moves), mainly in German/European contexts. They want information on topics covered, measurement scales, and demographics to analyze how motivation shapes decisions, behavior, and well-being.	A document is relevant if it centers on human motivation or motives—defining, measuring, or analyzing why people act—such as studies of intrinsic/extrinsic work motivation, achievement motivation, motivational action conflicts and interference in learning, or domain-specific motives like emigration, vocational choice, abortion counseling decisions, museum or forest trip reasons, drug use motives, and gaming motivations. Relevance is strongest when motivation is a primary construct with operationalized measures or scales (e.g., Luhmann–Mayntz, Schenk, militarism/affinity scales) and when it links motives to behaviors, outcomes, or well-being. Documents are non-relevant if they only mention “motivation” in passing among many topics without analysis, or if they use the term differently (e.g., letters of motivation for applications, legal “motive” in a non-psychological sense, or mechanical/engineering terms). Synonyms like “motives,” “reasons for,” “drivers,” and “incentives,” and constructs like work attitude that clearly index motivation count toward relevance; purely demographic or procedural descriptions of surveys without motivational items or findings are borderline. Edge cases include broad multi-topic datasets: they are relevant if they include explicit items or results about motives (e.g., reasons for learning languages or returning from abroad), but not if they only report logistics, coding schemes, or unrelated attitudes.
2160	beruf	The user is seeking sociological studies and datasets on occupations in Germany (Beruf), including vocational training, career trajectories, professionalization, licensing/occupational closure, and occupational prestige. The focus spans pre- and post-reunification periods and related themes such as social networks, mobility, job satisfaction, and demographics.	The query “beruf” is the German term for occupation/profession, so a document is relevant if it discusses jobs, careers, training, licensing/regulation, or occupational status using “Beruf” or clear variants such as berufs-, beruflich, Berufe, Berufsbezeichnung, Berufszufriedenheit. Examples of strong relevance include surveys of flight attendants’ career orientation and job satisfaction, longitudinal work biographies around the Wende, indices of occupational closure/licensing, or intergenerational mobility studies that record “Beruf des Vaters/Mutter.” Non-relevant cases include occurrences where “beruf” only appears inside unrelated words or contexts (e.g., Berufung/academic appointment, Berufsverkehr/rush hour), as a name/code, or without substantive discussion of occupations. Edge cases to consider are hyphenated compounds split across lines (Berufs-), OCR or spacing artifacts (Beruf s), capitalization differences, and English texts about occupations that are conceptually relevant but may not match the exact German token. Lists or metadata that merely enumerate the word are only marginally relevant, whereas detailed questionnaires or datasets specifying occupational variables are clearly relevant.
21846	links rechts	The user is seeking datasets and survey measures on the left–right (Links–Rechts) ideological spectrum—self-placement, party placement, and definitions—primarily in German political surveys (e.g., ALLBUS, GIP) and related historical/comparative studies. The goal is to analyze voter behavior, party competition, and political attitudes using left–right scales.	A document is relevant to the query “links rechts” when it explicitly treats the left–right political spectrum, for example by measuring Left–Right self-placement, positioning parties on a Left–Right scale, or collecting definitions of what “links” and “rechts” mean (e.g., ALLBUS 2008 open-ended questions F029/F030, or GIP modules rating CDU/CSU, SPD, FDP, Die Linke, Die Grünen, AfD on a Left–Right continuum). Material that uses Left–Right as an analytical dimension in election studies, panel surveys, party manifestos, or datasets with variables like “Links Rechts Selbsteinschätzung,” “Links Rechts Einstufung der Parteien,” or “Links Rechts Verständnis” is highly relevant. Documents are non-relevant if “links” and “rechts” refer only to physical directions, hyperlinks, or unrelated legal terms (Recht), or if the terms appear merely as passing labels without substantive analysis or measurement. Edge cases include school or youth surveys that mention “left/right” groups or images but still include a Left–Right self-placement scale (relevant), and metadata lists where “Links Rechts” appears only as a tag without corresponding variables or questions (likely not relevant). Studies that operationalize adjacent constructs (e.g., liberal–authoritarian) may be borderline unless they also map or anchor them to a Left–Right continuum.
21879	links rechts skala	The user is looking for datasets and documentation on the Left–Right (Links-Rechts) political scale, including measures of voter self-placement and party positions. They want sources that code EU/German election manifestos and surveys into left-right placements and related indices/coding schemes.	A document is relevant if it explicitly measures or codes political positions on a left–right scale, for example by including variables like “Selbsteinstufung auf einem Links–Rechts Kontinuum,” “Links–Rechts Einstufung der Parteien (11-point scale),” or “Euromanifesto placement on a Links–Rechts Skala.” It also counts as relevant when it derives indices from such coding (e.g., left–right positions computed from manifesto codes or EMCS/Klingemann–Volkens measures) or discusses methodology for left–right scaling across surveys or party manifestos. Documents are non-relevant if they only mention “links” and “rechts” as political camps or as directions without a scale, or if they feature other scales (liberal–authoritarian, pro/anti–EU) without a left–right dimension. Edge cases include reversed phrasing like “Rechts–Links Skala,” synonymous wording such as “left–right continuum” or “Skalometer,” and items about left- versus right-wing violence that lack a numeric placement—these are relevant only if a scale-based placement is present. Examples of clearly relevant content include datasets that code party manifestos for 1979–2004/2009 on a left–right scale and surveys that ask respondents to place themselves and parties on 0–10 or 11-point left–right scales.
221	immigration	The query seeks empirical surveys and datasets on immigration and integration in Germany and Europe, including public attitudes, policy preferences (asylum, deportation, skilled-worker migration), discrimination, and integration outcomes. It emphasizes study designs, sampling, and demographic variables to enable comparative and longitudinal analysis.	A document is relevant to the query “immigration” if it substantively addresses migration flows, asylum/refugee issues, immigrant integration, public attitudes or policy on immigration, or datasets/surveys focused on migrant populations and their experiences. Examples include panel surveys tracking new immigrants’ integration (e.g., ENTRA, SCIP), opinion polls on deportation vs. toleration, criteria for skilled worker entry, or welcoming culture (e.g., Verian and infratest dimap studies), cross‑EU studies on discrimination of migrants (EU MIDIS II), and coding of party positions or manifestos on immigration restrictions and multiculturalism. Methodological descriptions are relevant when they pertain to immigrant samples, sampling via registers/onomastics, CAWI/CATI/CAPI modes, or historical migration statistics (e.g., Canada inflows), because they enable analysis of immigration phenomena. A document is non‑relevant if immigration appears only tangentially within a broader topic (e.g., environment, rail services, consumer protection) without substantive immigration content, or if “integration” refers to non-human contexts (like software). Edge cases include security/terrorism or crime topics that are relevant only when explicitly tied to asylum or immigrant policy debates, and studies of children of immigrants or general political surveys that are relevant only when they include specific immigration items or migrant subsamples.
22708	media use	The query seeks comprehensive surveys and datasets on media use—especially digital media and learning—in Germany, detailing devices, applications, contexts (education, work, leisure, purchasing), motivations and attitudes, and demographic breakdowns across time. It also looks for evaluations of digital learning practices, target groups, infrastructure, challenges, and assessment formats across schools, higher education, vocational, and continuing education.	A document is relevant if it explicitly describes how people use media: which channels (TV, radio, social networks), how often and for what purposes (learning, political information, product research, leisure), on which devices, and with which user groups or demographics. Examples include surveys like AGMA Media Analyse on television/radio consumption, studies of digital learning that track use of WhatsApp, Moodle, YouTube or e-books, research on social media behavior and political information seeking, or scientists’ adoption of Web 2.0 tools. Documents are non-relevant if they only cover institutional equipment inventories, procurement or digitization strategies, or general attitudes without connecting them to actual media-use behavior; “media” in the sense of teaching aids or biological culture media is also out of scope. Edge cases: education-focused reports are relevant when they quantify or detail actual usage (e.g., frequency of LMS or webinars), but mere policy statements, methodology blurbs, or lists of available tools without user behavior are not. Historical or subgroup-specific media-use surveys (students, trainees, older adults, intensive social media users) remain relevant if they report patterns, frequencies, or contexts of use.
2272	work life balance	Find empirical studies and survey data on work–life balance, focusing on gender differences and how COVID-19, platform work, and academic employment affect the reconciliation of paid work and family life, especially in the EU. Include the role of unpaid care and the impact of policies such as family leave, institutional supports, and working time reduction.	A document is relevant if it directly examines work–life balance, such as measuring satisfaction with balancing work and private life, conflicts between job demands and family responsibilities, working-time arrangements or flexibility, parental or family leave, and the impact of caregiving or public policies on this balance. Examples from the passage include EU surveys on COVID-19 and gender equality covering changes in paid work and unpaid care and use of institutional instruments to handle work–life balance challenges; studies of platform workers’ work patterns and work–life balance; university staff surveys on reconciling academic careers and parenthood; rural Germany interviews on quality of life and work–life balance; and GIP modules explicitly asking about satisfaction with work–life balance and working-time reductions. Documents that only touch adjacent constructs (e.g., job satisfaction, working hours, childcare, partner support) can be partly relevant if they connect those factors to the ability to reconcile work and family/private life, whereas purely methodological or psychometric scale tests without work–family content are weakly relevant. Non-relevant materials include datasets on Germany’s balance of payments, political attitudes of FDJ youth, historical population studies, agrarian reform economics, or a church magazine copy test—these may contain words like “balance” or “work” but do not address the work–family interface. Edge cases include records that list “work–life balance” without any measures or findings (not relevant), and items focusing on unpaid care or leave that materially affect the ability to combine work and private life (relevant even without the exact phrase).
22951	medienkonsum	The user is looking for information on media consumption: how people use TV, radio, newspapers, and online media, how this is measured in surveys (time spent, exposure, preferences), and how it relates to demographics, political attitudes, and behaviors.	A document is relevant if it contains concrete measures or descriptions of media consumption behaviors, such as time spent with TV, radio, newspapers, internet or social media; frequency of use; program or genre preferences; primary information sources; trust in media; or household media equipment used as proxies for usage. Examples include time-use diaries that log quarter-hour media use, surveys of “Medienkonsum bei Tageszeitungen und Fernsehen,” datasets with “Zeitbudget für den Medienkonsum,” and panels like MEOF that passively track web/app usage. Studies that analyze how media consumption relates to political attitudes and voting, lifestyle and fashion segments, environmental concern, or COVID-19 information seeking are also relevant when they include explicit media-use variables. Edge cases include documents focusing mainly on media trust or interest without usage metrics (partially relevant), or on media devices and access where equipment variables serve as usage proxies. Non-relevant documents are those that only mention media consumption in passing without data, focus on content production or advertising markets rather than use, or discuss other kinds of consumption (e.g., diet) without specific media-use measures.
230	umweltbewusstsein	The user seeks research and data on environmental awareness, focusing on how public attitudes and behaviors are measured and have evolved over time. Specifically, they want details and findings from Germany’s biennial “Umweltbewusstsein in Deutschland” surveys (1996–2024), including methodology, samples, thematic modules (e.g., mobility, energy, health, agriculture), and trend results.	A document is relevant if it explicitly examines environmental awareness (Umweltbewusstsein), for example reporting on the “Umweltbewusstsein in Deutschland” survey series, its methods (e.g., CAWI panels, sampling), time trends, and constructs such as affect, cognition, and behavior. Content that analyzes attitudes, behaviors, policy perceptions, and segmentation related to environmental awareness, or related modules like environmental labels, Energiewende acceptance, or biodiversity awareness tied to consumers’ awareness, is strongly relevant. By contrast, pieces where “Umweltbewusstsein” appears only as a minor attribute in otherwise unrelated topics (e.g., corporate image studies of computer firms that include one item about a company’s environmental consciousness) are weakly relevant or non-relevant. Discussions of environment or technology without assessing awareness levels, or generic consumer studies without an explicit awareness construct, are not relevant. Edge cases include older spellings (Umweltbewußtsein), corporate vs. population awareness, and methodological details that are relevant only insofar as they illuminate how Umweltbewusstsein is measured or changes over time.
23614	medien nutzung	Find empirical studies and datasets on media usage in Germany, including how people use different media for product information and purchase decisions, social media behaviors and discourse, and the adoption and evaluation of digital media/OER in schools, vocational training, higher education, and adult learning. Emphasis on demographic breakdowns, attitudes, reliability assessments, and challenges of digital learning.	A document is relevant to the query “medien nutzung” when it reports how people use media—devices, platforms, and channels—covering purposes (e.g., learning, shopping, politics), intensity or frequency, contexts (school, university, workplace, home), and demographics. Examples from the paragraph that clearly match include the Monitor Digitale Bildung surveys detailing smartphone/tablet use, LMS like Moodle/ILIAS, OER adoption, digital exams, and attitudes across schools, training, higher education, and continuing education; the Kantar Public study of intensive social media users (language, discussion culture, hate speech); AGMA’s Media-Analyse on TV/radio consumption (1992–1997); and modules on using media to inform purchase decisions and assessing reliability across media. By contrast, pieces that only describe policies, technical specifications, or purely methodological notes without describing actual user behavior, usage metrics, or adoption patterns would be non-relevant. Edge cases: studies about “Medien” as teaching materials or OER are relevant only if they include concrete usage or adoption (e.g., whether teachers or learners actually use apps, videos, or LMS); items where “Medien” refers to laboratory culture media, artistic mixed media, or legal/media-industry structures without user usage data are not relevant.
2386	politische einstellung	The user is seeking studies and survey data on political attitudes—such as left-right orientation, party preference, participation, and views on democracy, protests, and extremism—across various populations, especially German students and youth. They likely want instruments and findings covering related issues (e.g., international relations, media use) with demographic correlates.	A document is relevant if it explicitly measures or analyzes people’s political attitudes or orientations, such as left–right self-placement, party identification or preference, sympathy scales for parties (e.g., CDU, SPD, FDP, NPD, DKP), evaluations of politicians, issue positions (e.g., NATO, Notstandsgesetze, Vietnam, DDR recognition), or views on democracy, protest, and use of political violence. Surveys of students, youth, teachers, or the general population that cover political participation, voting behavior, political efficacy, issue competence, and attitudes toward campus or national politics (e.g., SDS/APO, student parliaments, Hochschulreform) are strongly relevant. Mixed-topic datasets are relevant when they include political-attitude scales or items, even if they also cover media use, lifestyle, or consumption. Non-relevant would be documents where “Einstellung” means settings, adjustment, or hiring, or materials limited to administrative, economic, or cultural topics without attitudinal measures toward politics. Edge cases include datasets mentioning political attitude only as a single background variable—these are weakly relevant unless they report distributions or analyze it—and domain-specific attitudes (e.g., higher-education politics) which are relevant if they still capture broader political orientation or partisan sympathies.
23986	ungleichheit	Find comprehensive datasets and studies on social inequality (Ungleichheit), including trends, determinants, attitudes, and outcomes across employment, education, income, health, and politics. Emphasis is on German and comparative international sources (e.g., ALLBUS, ISSP, GISD) and research on factors such as mobility, atypical employment, and the effects of direct democracy on inequality.	A document is relevant when it treats “Ungleichheit” as a primary topic and provides measures, analyses, or theory related to inequality, for example ALLBUS or ISSP modules on Soziale Ungleichheit, the German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation, TwinLife’s study of social inequalities, or research on how direct democracy affects socio-economic, political, or legal inequalities. Relevance is strengthened by concrete indicators and variables tied to inequality, such as income distribution, deprivation scores, social mobility, acceptance of inequality, mechanisms producing inequality, or migrant–native disparities in education. Documents are non-relevant if they only mention inequality in passing while focusing on other themes (e.g., environment, national identity, or survey methods), or if “inequality” appears in an unrelated sense (like mathematical inequalities). Mixed-scope survey overviews are borderline: they count as relevant only when an inequality-focused module or items are explicitly included, while duplicate or generic versions without such content should be down-weighted. Geographic scope can be broad—Germany, Poland, or cross-national datasets are all relevant—provided the work includes measures or outcomes of unequal conditions or attitudes; otherwise, it should be treated as non-relevant.
24946	umweltschutz	The user seeks comprehensive statistics and surveys on environmental protection, including revenues from environmental goods and services by industry and environmental area, employment, and domestic vs. foreign sales in Germany over time. They also want research on public attitudes, behaviors, and policy evaluations related to environmental protection, transport, and consumer issues in Germany and the EU.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses environmental protection—such as reporting statistics on environmental goods and services, sectoral revenues by environmental domain (e.g., waste, water, air pollution control, climate protection), employment in the green sector, or exports vs. domestic sales of green technologies (e.g., solar, wind, insulation) from 1997–2020. It is also relevant if it analyzes environmental attitudes and behavior (recycling, energy saving, transport mode choice, willingness to pay, eco-tax), evaluates environmental quality (noise, air, water) or policy effectiveness, or discusses EU/German environmental policy and governance. By contrast, content primarily about consumer protection, TV program evaluations, general civil law, EU integration, or union politics is non-relevant unless it specifically examines environmental protection within those topics. Edge cases include multi-topic surveys where Umweltschutz is one module—these are relevant if that module is substantial or retrievable; closely related terms like Klimaschutz, Naturschutz, Luftreinhaltung, and environmental goods markets also qualify, while mere incidental keyword mentions without data, policy, or behavioral analysis do not.
2500	violence	The query seeks comprehensive survey-based information on violence—its prevalence, forms, perpetrators, attitudes, consequences, reporting, and protective behaviors—across varied contexts (schools, domestic, political/public) and populations, with emphasis on Germany and the EU. The aim is to understand patterns and correlates (e.g., social change, demographics) to inform prevention and policy-making.	A document is relevant if it substantively examines violence—its prevalence, forms (e.g., physical, sexual, stalking), contexts (school, domestic, political demonstrations, neighborhood), perpetrators and victims, consequences (health and well‑being), reporting behaviors, or prevention/protective measures and policies. Clear examples include surveys on violence against women and girls, schoolchildren’s use and experience of violence and property damage, readiness to use violence in political protest, group-focused enmity and neighborhood conflict, or conflict-related violence and self-protection strategies. Studies that measure attitudes, norms, and legal knowledge around violence (e.g., acceptance of corporal punishment, effectiveness of police or social services, reasons for violence, trends over time) are also relevant. Non-relevant items are those where “violence” is only mentioned in passing within broader topics (EU institutions, pensions/aging, fishery consumer habits) without dedicated data, analysis, or measures about violence, or where the term is used metaphorically. Edge cases include multi-topic datasets: they are relevant if they contain a dedicated module with detailed questions on violence or fear/threats of violence, and content on attitudes toward foreigners is relevant only when it explicitly addresses violent acts or reactions.
2585	kriminalität	The user seeks comprehensive information on crime, including official statistics and time-series trends, offense and offender data, regional patterns, and criminal justice outcomes. They also want survey-based insights on fear of crime, victimization, and institutional trust, focused on Germany (including former East Germany) and related EU topics like cybercrime.	A document is relevant if it provides empirical information about crime, such as statistics on offenses, offenders, convictions, or police/judicial processing (e.g., DDR time series of Straftaten and Täter per 100,000, regional crime rates by Bezirk, or Kaiserreich conviction rates by offense). Surveys that measure fear of crime, victimization, safety perceptions, trust in institutions, or attitudes toward crime and punishment (e.g., Saxony 2022 security study, student victimization/fear surveys, gastronomy owners’ experiences with extortion, or Eurobarometer modules on cybercrime) are also relevant. Content discussing crime types and structures (Deliktstruktur, Gewalt, Diebstahl, Raub, Cybercrime), “innere Sicherheit,” media consumption about crime, or policy measures to combat crime qualifies as relevant. By contrast, broad political or living-conditions surveys where “Kriminalität” appears only as a single item in a long list of issues, or modules unrelated to crime (e.g., agriculture or rail privatization) are non-relevant unless they include a substantive crime section. Edge cases include mixed datasets with both crime and non-crime modules (partially relevant) and documents using synonyms like Straftaten/Delikte without the exact keyword (still relevant).
26363	verkehrsmittel	The user is seeking surveys or datasets about transportation modes—public transport, car, bicycle, walking—covering factors that drive mode choice, accessibility, frequency of use, and satisfaction, alongside environmental attitudes and demographics. They likely want findings on commuting and travel behavior and the impact of policy measures in Germany.	Documents are relevant if they discuss transport modes (Verkehrsmittel) explicitly, such as mode choice, usage frequency, accessibility, headways, satisfaction, or attributes like cost, speed, flexibility, safety, and environmental impact; examples include surveys on ÖPNV (bus, tram, U-Bahn, S-Bahn, Regionalbahn), car ownership and licensing, taxi and bicycle use, Semesterticket/BahnCard possession, and combinations of modes for commuting, shopping, or leisure. Content covering attitudes and policies tied to mode choice—e.g., readiness to switch from car to public transport under certain conditions, evaluations of measures like cheaper ÖPNV or car restrictions, or environmental beliefs affecting mode selection—is also highly relevant. Vacation and weekend mobility modules remain relevant when they record the transport used for trips or the reasons for choosing one mode over another. Documents are non-relevant if they only mention the term in passing (e.g., a demographics section with no mode information) or discuss traffic/policy in the abstract without reference to specific transport modes or their use. Edge cases include health or local-quality-of-life surveys that record the mode to the doctor or city center (still relevant), and datasets where “Verkehrsmittelwahl” or variable lists enumerate modes without narrative (minimally but still relevant due to explicit mode coverage).
2662	politische orientierung	The user is seeking studies and datasets that define and measure political orientation (e.g., left–right, liberal–authoritarian, pro/anti-EU) and examine how it forms and diffuses. They want evidence from German/European contexts on determinants like socialization and networks and how orientations relate to party preferences, issue attitudes, and participation across groups such as students, youth, and the general public.	Documents are relevant if they explicitly measure, model, or discuss political orientation, such as ideological self-placement (e.g., left–right scales), party identification or sympathy thermometers (SPD, CDU/CSU, FDP, etc.), liberal–authoritarian or multiculturalism–ethnocentrism scales, or attitudes toward democracy, extremism bans, coalitions, or national/European integration. Highly relevant examples include surveys of political attitudes and socialization, network diffusion of political orientations, coded analyses of party manifestos positioned on ideological dimensions, or studies linking values to party preferences. Documents are non-relevant if “orientation” refers to non-political constructs (e.g., time orientation, lifestyle or group-style orientation, technical/computer orientation) or if politics is merely background without measuring political stance. Edge cases include domain-specific political orientations (e.g., university politics or East–West alignment), which are still relevant but narrower; datasets where political orientation appears only as a control or demographic field, which are weakly relevant; and historical content analyses of political language that infer ideology, which are relevant if they derive clear orientation measures. Mentions of “orientation” as guidance, onboarding, or geographic orientation without ideological content are not relevant.
26823	technology	The user seeks surveys and datasets on attitudes toward and adoption of technology, and their perceived impacts on work, environment, economy, health, and daily life, with detailed demographic variables. This includes European and German studies on ICT/5G, biotechnology and genetics, digital media, and industrial automation, as well as company- and worker-level data on technology use, skills, and training.	A document is relevant if technology is a primary focus—its adoption, use, impacts, or public attitudes—such as surveys on acceptance of gene technology and biotechnology, public opinion on 5G, studies of ICT use by managers, or company-level use of CAD/CNC, PPS, and automation. Content that analyzes technological change or policy (e.g., patent-based measures of innovation waves, nuclear power attitudes, multimedia and communication tech in daily life, or digital behavior and competence) is also squarely relevant. By contrast, documents that only mention “technology” tangentially (e.g., as a demographic code, a background variable, or in a proper name like “Institute of Technology”) without substantive discussion should be treated as non-relevant. Edge cases include broad social surveys (e.g., Eurobarometer) that touch many topics: they are relevant if the technology module is substantial, but low-relevance if technology appears only as a minor item. Likewise, texts about “technique,” “technicalities,” or generic “skills” without reference to technological artifacts, systems, or digital infrastructure should be considered non-relevant.
2741	sport	Find survey datasets on sports participation and attitudes, including leisure activities, club membership, facility access, barriers, and demographics. The goal is to analyze determinants and impacts of sport engagement—its links to life goals, work/family expectations, health behaviors, social values, and local sport offerings/policies—across different populations.	A document is relevant to the query “sport” when it substantively discusses athletic activity or its context, such as participation and frequency of leisure sport, motivations and barriers, facilities and equipment, club membership, competitions or festivals (e.g., Spartakiade), training intensity, or the financing and organization of sport clubs. Omnibus materials remain relevant if they include dedicated sections on sport (for example, surveys that pair attitudes to Hungary or the EU with detailed modules on sport participation, facilities, or club judgments). References to specific disciplines (soccer, long-distance running, swimming), sport badges/certificates, or evaluations of local sport centers also indicate strong relevance. By contrast, documents that only mention “sport” in passing, or match the string as part of unrelated words or names (e.g., transport, passport, or institution names without substantive athletic content) are non-relevant; an edge case is institutional or student-life surveys that are only relevant if they include explicit sport-motivation or activity modules.
2817	populismus	The user seeks survey datasets and research on populism in Germany and Europe, focusing on how populist attitudes are measured, their distribution and determinants, and their effects on voting behavior and democratic representation. Relevant sources include CSES Module 5, ValCon, ALLBUS 2018, GLES, and the German Internet Panel, with attention to sampling and fieldwork modes.	A document is relevant to the query “populismus” if it substantively examines populism as an ideology, party family, or set of citizen attitudes, or if it provides data and instruments to measure it. Examples include surveys or projects focused on populism (e.g., CSES Module 5 on the politics of populism, the ValCon project on social media and the rise of populism), or datasets that contain explicit populism scales and items such as “people vs. corrupt elites,” anti-compromise statements, demands for referendums, or claims that “politicians talk too much and act too little” (as in ALLBUS, GLES, and GIP). Documents that primarily present methodology or sampling can still be relevant when they include a populism module or enable analysis of populist attitudes, party competition, or effects on electoral behavior and democratic satisfaction. Non-relevant materials would discuss general politics without any populism construct, use “populist” only as a passing adjective, or focus on unrelated policy domains (e.g., taxation, health) without linking them to populism. Edge cases: German-language descriptions, repeated dataset summaries, or discussions of related constructs (trust, efficacy, national identity) are relevant only when explicitly tied to populism’s measurement or theorized effects.
28540	worklife balance	The user seeks research and datasets on work-life balance: the interplay between paid work and unpaid care/family life, its determinants, and policy supports such as family leave. They are especially interested in evidence from European/German surveys on COVID-19’s effects and gender differences.	A document is relevant if it examines how people reconcile paid employment with personal or family life and the supports or constraints shaping that, such as family leave, flexible work, unpaid care, time use, wellbeing, or gender differences. Clear examples here include the EU survey on COVID-19’s effects on work–life balance, the rural Germany survey that explicitly measures quality of life and work–life balance, and the platform work study assessing workers’ work patterns and work–life balance from a gender perspective. Documents are non-relevant when “balance” refers to economic accounting (e.g., balance of payments, trade balance, foreign exchange balances), historical monetary stocks, or when “work” refers to institutions or outputs rather than employment and private life. Edge cases include texts that only mention work–life balance in passing without measures or findings, analyses of work patterns that never connect to family/care or personal time, or alternative spellings (worklife, work-life) that are still relevant if the substance matches. Similarly, items about a “balance of power” in politics or “work of an organization” contain the keywords but are not about work–life balance and should be treated as non-relevant.
2884	fremdenfeindlichkeit	The user is seeking survey-based data and measures of xenophobia (Fremdenfeindlichkeit) and related prejudices (e.g., racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia), along with their socio-economic, political, and demographic correlates and trends. They want datasets and instruments from German and European studies (e.g., Thüringen Monitor, Eurobarometer) to analyze prevalence, contexts, and changes over time.	A document is relevant to the query “fremdenfeindlichkeit” if it directly examines xenophobia—such as attitudes toward foreigners, xenophobic behavior or violence, measurement scales, policy preferences about immigration, or its links to related prejudices like racism or Islamophobia. The provided paragraph is highly relevant because it repeatedly lists Fremdenfeindlichkeit as a measured construct in surveys (e.g., Thüringen Monitor, Eurobarometer), details items like frequency of hostile remarks toward foreigners, reactions to attacks, contact with migrants, and associated scales (authoritarianism, social dominance, antisemitism). Content using close synonyms or operationalizations—Ausländerfeindlichkeit, xenophobic violence, right‑wing extremism, willingness to live near foreigners, or support for restrictive immigration—also qualifies. Non‑relevant would be texts where the term appears only in passing without analysis (e.g., a generic list with no data or discussion) or where “fremd” refers to unrelated topics like tourism (Fremdenverkehr) or abstract “fear of the unfamiliar” not tied to out‑groups. Edge cases include media content analyses: they are relevant if they assess how xenophobia is portrayed (e.g., word choices, framing), but not if they merely quote headlines without addressing xenophobia itself.
2911	happiness	Identify surveys/datasets that measure happiness and life satisfaction and include rich covariates—especially alcohol use—alongside health, work, family, social networks, political attitudes, and demographics. The goal is to analyze determinants and cross-national patterns of subjective well-being across diverse populations and contexts.	A document is relevant if it directly measures or analyzes happiness as a psychological state or outcome, such as items on “feeling of happiness,” a “happiness scale,” general contentment with life or life satisfaction, or dependence of happiness on factors (e.g., work, partnership, money). Surveys focused on other domains (alcohol use, politics, EU integration, family, imprisonment) are relevant only when they explicitly include happiness or well-being measures, like “assessment of current contentment with life,” “associations with the term happiness,” or “self assessment of psychological well-being.” Non-relevant documents discuss those domains without any link to happiness or only provide demographics/interviewer ratings. Edge cases include uses of “happy” in narrower contexts—such as “happy partnership,” “a woman must have children to be happy,” or attitude items like “happy life without family”—which hit the keyword but may be tangential if they don’t assess overall well-being. Synonyms and related constructs (well-being, life satisfaction, contentment) should be treated as relevant signals.
29207	zufriedenheit ausbildung	The user seeks data or studies measuring satisfaction with vocational training (Ausbildung), especially survey items assessing trainees’ contentment with their training experience. They likely want variables on training quality, school–work balance, difficulties, outcomes, and background factors in German contexts (e.g., youth and DDR-era surveys).	A document is relevant if it explicitly measures or discusses satisfaction in the context of training or apprenticeship (Ausbildung), such as “Zufriedenheit mit der Berufsausbildung,” “Ausbildungs- und Arbeitszufriedenheit,” or evaluations of vocational school quality, training conditions, and outcomes during or right after an apprenticeship. Materials that report determinants or consequences of training satisfaction—e.g., problems in the apprenticeship, alignment of school and workplace training, recognition as a trainer, or satisfaction with the time split between Berufsschule and on-the-job learning—also qualify. By contrast, content about satisfaction in unrelated domains (household income, housing, health, politics, magazine satisfaction) or documents that describe education/training structures without any satisfaction angle are non-relevant. Edge cases include uses of Ausbildung outside vocational contexts (e.g., vormilitary or political training), which may match the keyword but be off-topic if the focus is vocational training, and job satisfaction after graduation that is only relevant if it is clearly linked to the prior training experience. Mentions of “Zufriedenheit” only as a label in a codebook or scale list without substantive analysis are also borderline.
29262	zufriedenheit arbeit	Find surveys and analyses on job satisfaction in Germany—how satisfied people are with their work and working conditions—including factors influencing it and variations by region, age, or occupation.	A document is relevant if it measures or discusses job satisfaction—terms like Arbeitszufriedenheit, Zufriedenheit mit der Arbeit/den Arbeitsbedingungen, or satisfaction with pay, recognition, workload, work collective, shift work, and career prospects, often via scales or surveys. Examples include studies on shift systems and workers’ well-being, descriptions of workplace demands paired with job satisfaction scales, or youth/DDR surveys listing “Zufriedenheit mit Arbeitsbedingungen insgesamt und konkret.” By contrast, items such as “Zufriedenheit mit der Arbeit der Bundesregierung” or satisfaction with political developments, housing, or neighborhood services are non-relevant unless they explicitly tie back to one’s own job satisfaction. Edge cases include documents that only describe working conditions or employment characteristics without an explicit satisfaction measure—these are borderline but can be considered if they analyze determinants of job satisfaction. Synonyms and close formulations like Berufszufriedenheit, Zufriedenheit mit dem Beruf, or Zufriedenheit mit der Tätigkeit should be treated as relevant.
29421	zufriedenheit	The user seeks survey-based research and datasets on life satisfaction and quality of life across multiple domains—housing, income, health, work, family, safety, environment, and leisure—along with demographic correlates and future expectations. Emphasis is on East and West Germany (including the former GDR) with comparisons across cities, rural areas, and diverse groups (e.g., seniors, youth, prisoners, social workers), plus some international perspectives.	A document is relevant to the query “zufriedenheit” if it explicitly mentions the German term or close variants and compounds (e.g., Lebenszufriedenheit, Arbeitszufriedenheit, Berufszufriedenheit, Zufriedenheit mit dem Einkommen/Wohnung/Gesundheit/Familienleben/Kirche/Sozialsystem, Zufriedenheitsindex) or describes measurements/scales of satisfaction (Skalometer, LSI). The provided paragraph is highly relevant because it repeatedly covers satisfaction across many domains: income and living standard, housing and neighborhood, health and healthcare, work and job conditions, partnership/family and childcare, social contacts, safety and crime, local politics and services, media programs, and seniors’ and prisoners’ satisfaction. Documents that discuss related constructs like Glücksgefühl (happiness), Wohlbefinden (well-being), Lebensqualität (quality of life), hopes/fears, or optimism without using the satisfaction keyword may be borderline—contextually related but possibly missed by a strict keyword match; negative forms like Unzufriedenheit are still relevant. Edge cases include morphological forms (zufrieden as adjective), instrument names (Zufriedenheitsindex, Lebenszufriedenheitsskala), or brief mentions within larger multi-topic surveys (still relevant), whereas passages limited to demographics, interviewer ratings, or procedural details without any satisfaction content are non-relevant.
2945	life satisfaction	The query seeks empirical surveys and measures of life satisfaction and quality of life, including their determinants and trends. It focuses on domains such as housing, employment, income, health, family/partnerships, social networks, politics, and the environment, with particular emphasis on West and East Germany and some international comparisons over time.	A document is relevant if it directly measures or analyzes life satisfaction or closely related constructs such as subjective well-being or happiness, especially when using explicit scales or global items (e.g., “general contentment with life,” “feeling of happiness,” LSI or general satisfaction scales). Highly relevant examples include surveys that assess overall life satisfaction alongside domain satisfactions (income, housing, health, family/partnership, leisure, public safety, democracy), compare satisfaction over time or across regions (e.g., East vs. West Germany), or examine determinants like unemployment, environmental stress, and social security with life satisfaction outcomes. Non-relevant documents are those that only provide demographics or interview logistics without any life satisfaction measure, or that discuss “satisfaction” solely in unrelated contexts (e.g., job or customer satisfaction) without linking to overall life evaluation. Edge cases include studies focused on predictors (pollution, crime, rent, political attitudes) that are still relevant if they include a life satisfaction variable or analyze its change; conversely, pieces on future expectations or values are borderline unless tied back to a life satisfaction or happiness metric.
30368	work	The user seeks comprehensive, survey-based information on working life, including actual and preferred working hours, shift/overtime practices, commute, workplace organization, compensation, and attitudes toward work. They want analyses—particularly in GDR/FRG contexts—linking these factors to satisfaction, health, performance, and labor relations (e.g., unions and works councils) across demographic groups.	A document is relevant to the query “work” when it centers on employment and workplace topics such as working hours, overtime, shift and night work, job satisfaction, pay, safety, unions, commuting, and works councils. Materials that discuss attitudes to work, coordination of schedules between partners, health effects of work, performance evaluation, collective dynamics, and time-budgeting (e.g., core hours, flextime, overtime compensation) also qualify. Demographic or political details remain relevant if they are explicitly tied to work contexts—union membership, occupational qualification, readiness to change jobs, leadership style, or plan fulfillment in a work collective—but become less relevant if they stand alone without a workplace link. Non-relevant cases include “work” used in other senses (physics work, “the machine works,” “works of art”), or schoolwork/housework not tied to employment. Edge cases include documents that mostly describe leisure or family but frame them as work–life balance, or sector-specific notions like socialist “work collectives” and plan discussions; these are still relevant due to direct linkage to employment.
31054	schule	The user is seeking research and datasets related to schools, particularly the German education system. This includes its historical development and enrollment statistics, cross-country education indicators, and contemporary surveys on student attitudes, teacher practices, digital learning, classroom management, and school resources (e.g., via HISTAT).	For the query “schule” (German for school), a document is relevant if it primarily concerns schooling and the school system, including students, teachers, institutions, and policies. Examples include historical datasets on Höhere Schulen in the German Empire (e.g., Gymnasien, Realgymnasien, and lateinlose Anstalten in Preußen, Bayern, Württemberg), tables on enrollment and Abiturienten from HISTAT, and studies on transitions after grade 4, school inspections, VERA tests, classroom management, or digital infrastructure and learning in schools. It is non-relevant if it focuses mainly on universities or adult/vocational education without a clear school link, or uses “Schule” figuratively (e.g., Frankfurter Schule as a school of thought) or only in passing. Edge cases include mixed series that combine school and university indicators—partially relevant when school metrics are present—and documents centered on “Schüler” or “Lehrer” without the word “Schule,” which can still be relevant due to direct topical overlap.
3107	drugs	The user is seeking comprehensive, survey-based information on drug use and attitudes—covering alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs—especially among youth, including prevalence, motives, risk perceptions, accessibility, and personal/network exposure. They want datasets/questionnaires (e.g., Germany and EU Eurobarometer/BZgA) with measures of policy and prevention attitudes, sanctions, and institutional roles, along with detailed demographics and social-context variables.	Highly relevant documents for the query “drugs” explicitly discuss illicit or psychoactive substance use, attitudes, availability, risks, prevention, policy, or enforcement—like surveys on youth consumption of cannabis, ecstasy, cocaine, heroin, perceptions of health danger and dependence, motives for use, access within 24 hours, legalization, drug testing, and effectiveness of anti-drug campaigns. Content that ties drugs to related public health issues (e.g., AIDS transmission, harm reduction), gateway substances (alcohol and nicotine), and comparative assessments across places or demographics also fits well, especially when it includes measures, settings (schools, parties, clubs), and social networks. Examples here include questions on personal drug offers, places to obtain drugs, preferred sentences for drug crimes, therapy vs. punishment, and knowledge of legal consequences—all squarely on-topic. Documents would be non-relevant if “drug” appears only tangentially (e.g., general health, housework, or job stress without a drug component) or refers solely to unrelated uses of the word (pharmaceutical stock markets, “drug” as the past tense of drag). Edge cases include pieces focused solely on alcohol/tobacco or medications used as prescribed; they may be borderline unless framed as entry drugs, abuse, or part of a broader intoxicant/drug problem.
31126	schichtarbeit	The query seeks survey-based information on shift work—its schedules, prevalence, and conditions—and how it influences TV/radio consumption, daily time use, health, family life, and satisfaction. It also calls for demographic breakdowns and related workplace factors (e.g., overtime, weekend work, partner’s schedule).	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses shift work (Schichtarbeit) structures and timing, such as two-, three-, or four-shift rotations, late-shift end times, night-shift routines, and the frequency or necessity of shift schedules. It is especially relevant when it analyzes the effects of shift work on workers’ lives and jobs—health complaints, family and childcare, sleep, leisure, and media habits (for example, TV preferences after a late shift or radio listening by shift status), including the partner’s shift schedule. Surveys that include “Schichtarbeit” as a demographic field can be relevant if they stratify or compare outcomes by shift status or explore time budgets and weekend work in relation to shifts; a mere checkbox without analysis is only weakly relevant. Documents focused solely on audience ratings, program evaluations, or general demographics with no link to shift schedules are non-relevant. Edge cases like studies of on-call duty, Saturday/Sunday work, or flexible hours are relevant when they clearly imply rotating or nonstandard work hours akin to shift work.
3125	arbeitslosigkeit	The user seeks comprehensive information on unemployment—its trends, determinants, and policy responses—with a focus on Europe (especially Germany), including cross-country comparisons since the 1970s and macroeconomic frameworks like Okun’s law and hysteresis. They also want relevant datasets and survey evidence and analyses of social impacts across periods such as the Weimar era and post-reunification East Germany.	A document is relevant to the query “arbeitslosigkeit” if it directly analyzes unemployment—its trends, levels, causes, or remedies—such as studies of rising EU joblessness since 1974, cross-country comparisons (Germany, France, UK, Italy), or macro models like Okun’s law and the hysteresis hypothesis that explain persistence. Empirical resources centered on unemployment (e.g., time series tables of EU/US/Japan jobless rates, variable-parameter regressions for Germany 1960–1990, or longitudinal surveys of East German unemployed and their partners) are also clearly relevant. Macro discussions that link unemployment with inflation and growth, or evaluate labor-market institutions and policy responses, count as relevant when unemployment is a principal outcome. By contrast, documents are weakly relevant or non-relevant if “Arbeitslosigkeit” appears only as a minor survey item among many neighborhood or political topics, or if the focus is mainly on other issues (e.g., inflation) with little substantive treatment of unemployment. Edge cases include historical analyses (e.g., Weimar-era unemployment) and methodological overviews or tables of contents that still provide unemployment measures or frameworks—those are relevant—whereas materials on employment or training that never connect to unemployment rates, or metaphorical uses of the term, are not.
3147	antisemitismus	The user seeks comparable survey data and analyses on antisemitism, including prevalence, forms (hate crime, hate speech, discrimination), attitudes toward Jews, and personal experiences, along with legal awareness and reporting behavior. The focus is on EU- and Germany-based studies and trends over time with demographic detail.	A document is relevant to the query “antisemitismus” when it explicitly examines antisemitism as attitudes, experiences, incidents, or policy/legal responses—such as surveys of Jewish people’s exposure to harassment, hate crime, discrimination, or perceptions of safety and media/internet hostility. For example, reports of the FRA’s 2018 EU survey of 16,395 Jewish respondents, question modules on antisemitic comments, vandalism, legal awareness, and trends over time, or datasets like Eurobarometer, ALLBUS, GLES, and Thüringen Monitor that include classic, secondary, and Israel‑related antisemitism scales are clearly relevant. Documents that only list “antisemitism” alongside many topics (e.g., racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia) are still relevant if they specify measures, items, or results on antisemitism; they are non‑relevant if the term appears merely in passing without any content, data, or findings. Materials focused solely on unrelated modules (e.g., housing conditions or biodiversity) are non‑relevant unless they contain a dedicated antisemitism section. Edge cases include methodology‑only descriptions (sampling, weighting) that are relevant if they pertain to an antisemitism module, and texts about Israel/Palestine that are relevant when operationalized as antisemitism items (e.g., NS comparisons, boycotts), but not when discussing geopolitics without an antisemitism frame.
3148	health	The user seeks comprehensive survey and time-series data on health-related topics—health education, personal behaviors, occupational safety/psychosocial risks, and the organization and financing of health care—primarily in Germany and Europe. They need sources, indicators, and methodologies (e.g., ISSP, ESENER, HISTAT) for cross-time and cross-national analysis to support research or policy.	A document is relevant to the query “health” when it substantively addresses human health, health behaviors, health education, healthcare systems/financing, public health metrics, or occupational safety and health. Examples that clearly qualify include surveys of children’s health education, descriptions of Germany’s statutory health insurance and expenditure accounts, ISSP modules on health and healthcare, OSH surveys on psychosocial risks, and studies of nutrition, smoking, exercise, and preventive checkups. Materials that are heavy on methodology, demographics, or codes can still be relevant if they measure or inform health outcomes, services, or policy; by contrast, texts that only mention “health” in passing (e.g., in an institution’s name) without substantive health content are not relevant. Edge cases such as historical insurance statistics, workplace risk management, and food risk assessments are relevant because they concern determinants or measurement of human health, whereas uses of “health” to describe business or system performance, or incidental mentions in unrelated topics, are non-relevant. Variants and related terms (e.g., health care, healthful lifestyle, OSH, GKV/RVO) and even misspellings count toward relevance, but documents that are just variable lists without health context or that focus on non-human health (plants/animals) would not.
31794	safety	Find survey-based information on how organizations manage safety—especially occupational safety and health—covering risk assessments, psychosocial risks, training, regulatory compliance, supervisory oversight, and employee participation. Emphasis is on European and German studies (e.g., ESENER, company/employee surveys, Eurobarometers) and related topics like product and consumer safety.	A document is relevant if it treats safety as a central theme—such as occupational safety and health (risk assessments, training, regulatory compliance, accident/illness rates), consumer and product safety (testing, labeling, recalls), or public safety domains like road or flight safety—and describes concrete measures, policies, practices, or perceptions. Empirical materials (e.g., surveys of enterprises about OSH, supervision by authorities, prevention culture, psychosocial risk management) are highly relevant because they show how safety is organized, implemented, and evaluated. A document is non-relevant when “safety” appears only incidentally, as a brand name or metaphor, or in unrelated contexts (e.g., financial safety nets, inventory safety stock, or cybersecurity without a clear link to physical/occupational/product safety). Edge cases include broad workplace well-being texts that mention safety alongside health: they are relevant only if they detail safety procedures, roles, or outcomes rather than listing safety as a buzzword. Historical or region-specific surveys also qualify when they describe concrete safety frameworks or outcomes, even if they use variant terms like H&S, OSH, GDA, or ESENER.
32087	sexualität	The user is seeking social research datasets and surveys on sexuality in Germany, including attitudes, behaviors, education, contraception, and HIV/AIDS across populations such as adolescents, students, and prisoners. They want studies with methodological details and demographics that explore relationships, sexual health knowledge, and protection practices.	A document is relevant if it centrally discusses human sexuality (Sexualität) or closely related constructs, such as sexual behavior, attitudes, education, contraception, HIV/AIDS, consent, or sexualized peer violence—e.g., surveys of adolescents and students on first intercourse, masturbation, contraceptive use, sexual orientation, or evaluations of sex education and protection concepts. Materials like study descriptions, questionnaires, data dictionaries, or reports from BZgA/BMBF projects that enumerate variables on “Liebe und Sexualität,” sexual morals, partner dynamics, or AIDS knowledge are strongly relevant, even when presented as topic lists. Documents are only weakly or non-relevant if “Sexualität” appears in passing within a broader health or lifestyle inventory (for instance, listed once among many life domains without substantive analysis), or if it is used metaphorically or solely in citations. German-language content and morphological variants (Sexualverhalten, sexuell, sexualisierte Gewalt) increase relevance; so do population-specific studies (e.g., youth, students, prisoners) that measure sexual practices, norms, and protection behaviors. Edge cases include duplicates of the same survey description, items about film reception tied to youth love/sexuality (relevant if they analyze sexual themes), or biology-focused texts on animal reproduction without the human-social context (likely non-relevant to this query).
32407	sexual	The query seeks comprehensive survey data on sexual behavior and partner relations—covering attitudes to love/sexuality, first intercourse, contraception and condom use, practices and frequency, orgasms, orientation, cohabitation, partner violence, and HIV/AIDS knowledge and communication—across groups such as youth, students, workers, prisoners, and homosexuals, with relevant demographic and social context.	For the query “sexual,” a document is relevant when it directly addresses sexuality or sexual behavior, using terms like sexual intercourse, masturbation, sexual orientation, contraception, AIDS/HIV risk, or partner relations. The provided text is highly relevant because it enumerates survey topics on first intercourse, contraceptive use, orgasms, masturbation, orientations (heterosexual/homosexual/bisexual), sexual practices, and AIDS knowledge across multiple populations (youth, students, workers, prisoners). By contrast, documents where “sexual” appears only incidentally or in unrelated contexts—such as sexual reproduction in plants, sexual dimorphism in animals, or “sex” used solely as a demographic field—would be weakly relevant or non-relevant. Edge cases include content that avoids the exact word “sexual” but clearly discusses sexual conduct via synonyms like intimacy, cohabitation, or partner practices, which should still be treated as relevant. Another edge case is policy or violence-focused texts (e.g., sexual violence, rape) that discuss sexual matters without detailing behavior; these are generally relevant due to the explicit sexual context even if the emphasis is legal or safety-related.
3247	political orientation	The user seeks empirical research and survey evidence on political orientation—how it is measured (e.g., left–right self-placement, participation, trust, values) and what determines it—focusing on the relative impact of individual factors versus local/municipal context, particularly in Europe/Germany. They are looking for findings, datasets, and indices that assess these orientations across populations including youth.	A document is relevant if it defines, measures, or analyzes political orientation at the individual or collective level—e.g., left–right self-placement, party preference and sympathy scales, attitudes toward democracy and institutions, political interest and participation, or value orientations (such as materialist/postmaterialist) that are explicitly linked to political beliefs. Studies examining contextual determinants of political orientations—like the impact of municipalities, Europeanization, or globalization on citizens’ ideological views—also qualify, including multilevel analyses combining individual and local data. Non-relevant material includes uses of “orientation” in non-political domains (consumer, price, innovation, or purely moral orientations) or generic political content that does not address ideological placement or related attitudinal constructs. Edge cases: “East/West orientation of the country” or “European orientations” can be relevant if the focus is on political alignment rather than geography; methodological and demographic inventories are relevant only insofar as they are tied to measuring or explaining political orientation. By contrast, logistical interview details, clothing and lifestyle topics, or youth culture content without a clear link to political beliefs should be treated as non-relevant.
32738	sicherheit	Find survey-based datasets and analyses related to “Sicherheit” (security/safety) across Germany and Europe, including social security systems, personal and internal security perceptions, victimization and protective measures, workplace safety and health (ESENER), cyber/data protection, and defense policy. The user seeks studies with detailed measures, methodologies, and demographic variables.	A document is relevant if it uses the German term “Sicherheit” or clear compounds of it (e.g., innere Sicherheit, Sicherheitsbehörden, Sicherheitsgefühl, Arbeitssicherheit/Arbeitsschutz, soziale Sicherheit/Sozialversicherung, Sicherheitspolitik) and substantively discusses safety/security in contexts such as public/internal security, workplace health and safety, social protection, national defense, nuclear safety, or internet security/data protection. Examples that fit include surveys on perceptions of inner security and crime, ESENER studies on occupational safety and psychosocial risks, evaluations of government security measures, NATO/EU security and defense topics, and modules on nuclear plant safety or cybersecurity and privacy. Non-relevant material would be text that lacks the concept or uses “Sicherheit” in an unrelated sense (e.g., “Sicherheit” as certainty/assurance, “Sicherung” as a fuse or backup) or sections like sunbathing habits that do not connect to safety/security; purely demographic lists without security content also do not qualify. Edge cases include relevant synonyms without the exact keyword (Schutz, Gefahrenabwehr, Arbeitsschutz) or compounds like Sicherheitslage/Sicherheitsgefühl that should count, while adjectival “sicher” meaning “sure” may not. In multi-topic surveys, documents remain relevant if they contain a distinct section on security (even among many themes), but items that only name-drop “Sicherheit” in a checklist without explanation are marginal.
32820	selbstdarstellung	The user wants to locate German survey datasets or questionnaire sections that measure “Selbstdarstellung” (self-presentation), especially within election studies and modules on political attitudes. They seek items on candidate self-presentation and individual self-presentation alongside related scales on prejudice, authoritarianism, and social integration.	A document is relevant to the query “selbstdarstellung” when it explicitly addresses self-presentation—how people or actors present themselves to others—such as survey items or analyses on “Selbstdarstellung der Wahlkreiskandidaten im Wahlkampf” or statements about “Ideenlosigkeit zur Selbstdarstellung.” It also counts if it operationalizes the concept (questions, scales, variables, results) in political communication, social psychology, or media contexts, including motives, strategies, or perceived effects of self-presentation. Documents are non-relevant if they only discuss other “Selbst-” constructs (e.g., Selbsteinschätzung, Selbsteinstufung, Selbstverantwortung) or focus solely on prejudice, economic assessments, or party preferences without any link to how someone presents themselves. Edge cases include synonyms or near-synonyms like Selbstinszenierung or Außendarstellung, plural or hyphenated forms (Selbstdarstellungen, Selbst-Darstellung), and lists that merely mention the term; a mere variable label can still be relevant, while “Darstellung” of parties or media portrayal that is not self-directed generally is not.
3294	haushaltseinkommen	The user is seeking data or analysis on household income as a demographic variable in German surveys, including its measurement, distribution, and links to household characteristics, economic conditions, and political preferences.	A document is relevant to the query “haushaltseinkommen” when it explicitly discusses household income—e.g., reports or surveys that measure, compare, or analyze household income by demographics (age, education, occupation), region, or over time, or relate it to macro topics like unemployment and price developments. Entries that list “Haushaltseinkommen” as a survey variable or demographic attribute (such as in topic lists of economic or election studies) are relevant, though they may be lower priority if they only enumerate variables without analysis. Synonyms and close variants—“Nettohaushaltseinkommen,” “Familieneinkommen,” “Äquivalenzeinkommen,” “HH‑Einkommen,” the genitive “Haushaltseinkommens,” or the English “household income”—also count. Non-relevant items include uses of “Haushalt” meaning a public budget (“Staatshaushalt,” “Haushaltsplan”) or documents discussing “Einkommen” in general without a household context. Edge cases include OCR/line-break variants (“Haushalts­einkommen,” hyphenation), metadata-only mentions, or duplicate listings; these still match but may provide little substantive information.
3297	schulische bildung	The query seeks an overview of school education in Germany, including system structures, curricula, and the role of parents and cultural education in children’s development. It also looks for empirical findings and datasets on educational pathways, competencies, transitions, and inequalities (e.g., by migration background or region) across historical and contemporary studies.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses formal school education (primary and secondary)—for example, curricula, school types and transitions (e.g., 4th grade to Gymnasium/Realschule), classroom practices, teacher cooperation, student competencies (IQB studies), or parental roles in school-based cultural education. Items describing the DDR school structure (POS/EOS), gifted education measures, or participation in “schulische und außerschulische” offerings that explicitly compare or anchor the analysis in the school context are clearly in scope. By contrast, works focused mainly on adult/continuing education (Weiterbildung, PIAAC for adults), higher education, labor-market mobility, or historical qualification crises in public service—where “schulische Bildung” appears only as a background variable—are not relevant. Edge cases include mixed studies spanning school and vocational/tertiary sectors; these are relevant if they contain dedicated analysis of school-age populations or school-based programs, and cultural education counts when it is explicitly situated in schools rather than solely out-of-school contexts. German variants like “Schulbildung,” “allgemeinbildende Schule,” and “schulische Bildungsgänge” are strong signals, but mere keyword mentions in long variable lists without substantive discussion should be treated as non-relevant.
32984	security	Find studies and survey datasets on “security” in multiple senses—social security systems, perceptions of internal/public safety, surveillance and data retention, defense/foreign policy, and security sector reform. Emphasis is on Germany and Europe (plus a Syrian SSR survey in Germany), covering attitudes, experiences, institutions, and survey methodologies.	A document is relevant to the query “security” when it substantively addresses public safety, security sector reform, internal security policy, defense and policing, surveillance/data retention, cyber/Internet security, or citizens’ perceptions and trust in security institutions (e.g., surveys on Syrians’ views of security sector reform, German public opinion on CCTV and airport measures, or attitudes toward the Bundeswehr). Methodological descriptions of such studies (samples, CATI/CAWI, weighting) remain relevant if they investigate security outcomes like fear of crime, civilian oversight, or data protection against online threats. Content focused on “social security” as welfare systems (pensions, health insurance, family allowances, FRG–GDR comparisons) may be only marginally relevant unless the user intent clearly includes welfare-state security; otherwise these are typically non-relevant for safety/defense-oriented searches. Edge cases include “security” meaning job security or housing security (usually non-relevant) versus Internet security topics like viruses, fraud, and data protection (relevant). Documents that only mention “security” in passing (e.g., as a keyword or funding note) or that solely present historical social expenditure without linkage to safety, crime, defense, or security institutions should be considered non-relevant.
3307	political participation	The user is seeking surveys and datasets that measure political participation (voting, protest, organizational and online engagement) and related attitudes (interest, efficacy, alienation), along with rich demographics and socialization factors across different groups and time periods. The goal is to analyze the drivers, forms, and trends of participation—primarily in Germany but also in other European contexts.	A document is relevant if it describes behaviors, readiness, or opportunities for political participation—such as voting, protesting, contacting politicians, signing petitions (online or offline), party or union membership, or participation in civic initiatives—and often pairs these with measures like political interest, efficacy, alienation, or the Kaase index. Content detailing contexts where participation occurs (e.g., municipal renovation protests in German cities, Bundeswehr members’ political attitudes, online political activities like letters to the editor, signature campaigns, or donations) and the demographic or social predictors of participation (education, class, religion, media use) also fits. Documents focused on closely related attitudes and intentions (e.g., protest willingness, perceived influence, postmaterialism) are typically relevant, especially when linked to concrete participatory acts or scales. Non-relevant items would be those using “participation” only in non-political domains (family or school participation without a political dimension), or that discuss politics solely as opinion or policy issues (e.g., climate change or anti-Americanism) without tying them to participatory behavior. Edge cases include media-use or wellbeing surveys that are relevant only if they explicitly measure political engagement outcomes, and union or student-organization elections that count when they analyze political behavior rather than purely internal administrative participation.
33259	selbstwirksamkeit	Find studies and datasets that measure self-efficacy (Selbstwirksamkeit), including definitions, validated scales, and survey items, particularly within German/European social research on youth development, parenting/education, entrepreneurship, coping with post-reunification change, and value orientations.	A document is relevant if it directly addresses Selbstwirksamkeit (self-efficacy), for example by including a “Selbstwirksamkeit” scale, reporting results on general or domain-specific self-efficacy (e.g., parental/learning self-efficacy, coping self-efficacy), or evaluating an intervention’s effect on self-efficacy. Surveys or panels that list “Skala/Skalometer Selbstwirksamkeit,” “Allgemeine Selbstwirksamkeit,” or equivalent English terms (self-efficacy, GSE) count as relevant even if they primarily describe measurement design or item wording rather than outcomes. It is non-relevant if it only treats adjacent constructs such as self-esteem (Selbstwertgefühl), autonomy/self-determination (Autonomie, Selbstbestimmung), self-responsibility (Selbstverantwortlichkeit), or resilience without measuring or analyzing self-efficacy. An edge case is domain labeling: parental or academic self-efficacy is relevant, but references to “Selbstständige” (the self-employed) or other “Selbst-” terms are not. Brief topical lists that explicitly include “Selbstwirksamkeit” (e.g., among personality scales in youth, entrepreneurship, or European value surveys) are still relevant, whereas mere tangential mentions in citations or metadata are not.
33371	selbstverwirklichung	The query seeks survey-based insights on “Selbstverwirklichung” (self-actualization) in Germany—how it is defined, valued, and pursued across domains like leisure, work, family, and culture, and which factors correlate with or hinder it. It aims to identify measures, attitudes, motives, and pathways to self-realization reported in the referenced studies.	A document is relevant to the query “selbstverwirklichung” when it explicitly discusses self-fulfillment as a value, motive, or outcome, such as “Wege der Selbstverwirklichung,” the importance of self-realization in work or leisure, or survey/value batteries that include Selbstverwirklichung alongside items like Leistung, Pflichtbewusstsein, or Leben genießen. Content that operationalizes or measures the concept (e.g., attitudes toward self-actualization, goals like “Selbstverwirklichung im Fach,” or the role of culture, hobbies, and reading as avenues of self-realization) is highly relevant, even if embedded in broader studies on lifestyle, politics, or work-life balance. Documents referencing related constructs in recognized frameworks (e.g., postmaterialist values, autonomy and self-direction) or synonyms like Selbstentfaltung also count. Non-relevant items include texts that only list demographics or unrelated topics without linking to self-fulfillment, or false positives where similar words (e.g., Selbstständigkeit for self-employment or Selbstverwaltung for self-administration) appear without conceptual overlap. Edge cases include long topic lists that mention Selbstverwirklichung only once; these are still relevant if they indicate measurement or discussion, but marginal if the term is merely name-checked without context or analysis.
3340	sex	The user seeks studies and datasets where sex is central—both as gender and as sexuality—including gender-disaggregated labor force and demographic tables and surveys on sexual behavior, AIDS, and LGBTI experiences. They appear to want sources primarily from Germany/Europe across historical periods (e.g., censuses, microcensuses, and FRA surveys).	For the keyword “sex,” documents are relevant if they address sexual behavior, sexuality, or sexual health (e.g., surveys on attitudes to sexuality, AIDS-related condom use, number of sexual partners, group sex, homosexual contacts, or sex education), or if they use sex as an analytic demographic variable (e.g., employment rates, age structure, or labor force tables broken down by male/female). The provided text is highly relevant because large sections focus directly on sexual conduct and HIV prevention, while many datasets explicitly segment results “by sex” or “sex assigned at birth.” Documents are partially or marginally relevant when “sex” appears only incidentally in metadata (e.g., “sex of the interviewer”) or as a routine stratification in studies whose primary topic is unrelated to sexuality (such as economic statistics), unless sex-based analysis is central to the findings. Edge cases include content like “sex tourism” or “orientation to one’s own sex,” which still match sexual topics, and historical or labor datasets that merely list “by sex” in table headings without substantive discussion, which may be too thin for some intents behind the query. Non-relevant documents would be those where “sex” is an acronym or appears only as a stray label with no meaningful connection to gender or sexual behavior.
33461	rechts links	The user is seeking information on the German left–right (links–rechts) political spectrum, including how people define “left” and “right,” self- and party placements on left–right scales, and related measures of voter behavior. They appear interested in survey datasets and studies (e.g., ALLBUS, GIP, panel studies) that operationalize and analyze left–right ideology.	A document is relevant if it explicitly measures, defines, or analyzes the political left–right spectrum, often signaled by terms like Links-Rechts Einstufung, Selbsteinstufung, Links-Rechts Kontinuum, or Verständnisse der Begriffe links und rechts. Clear examples include surveys asking open-ended definitions of “links” and “rechts” (e.g., ALLBUS 2008 F029/F030), party and voter placements on left–right scales in the German Internet Panel, or coded manifestos and election studies that locate parties on a left–right axis. Historical or comparative studies that operationalize left–right (e.g., Weimar-era left–right dichotomies, Euromanifesto left–right codes) are also relevant even when embedded in broader topics like issue competence or value orientations. By contrast, documents that use rechts/links only as physical directions, legal “Recht,” or incidental mentions without ideological placement, or that list parties without left–right coding, are non-relevant. Edge cases that still count include half-scales, derived indices, or proxies (state intervention vs market, liberal–authoritarian) when they are tied back to a left–right placement; datasets with demographics or party preference alone, absent any left–right measure, are not.
3365	drogen	The query seeks survey-based information on drug use and attitudes—covering illegal drugs, alcohol, and tobacco—including prevalence, initiation age, contexts of use, perceived risks, access, prevention measures, and policy/testing opinions. It emphasizes youth and general populations in Germany and Europe, with detailed demographics and related topics such as AIDS awareness.	A document is relevant to the query “drogen” if it substantively discusses drugs in the German sense—illegal and/or legal psychoactive substances—covering topics like consumption patterns, access and availability (e.g., within 24 hours), age of initiation, settings of use (schools, parties, clubs), health risks, prevention/education campaigns, legalization, or drug testing by police or employers. Content detailing specific substances (cannabis, heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamines), motives for use, consequences, or survey-based attitudes and demographics clearly qualifies. Material focused solely on alcohol and tobacco can still be relevant when treated as drugs in comparative health or policy contexts, or when included in broader drug behavior surveys. Non-relevant cases include texts where “drogen” means something else (e.g., Dutch “drogen” = to dry, retail “Drogerie”), or documents that only mention AIDS or other health topics without any drug-related link. Brief, passing mentions of drugs without substantive discussion would also be marginal or non-relevant.
34145	rechtsextremismus	The user seeks empirical, survey-based information on right-wing extremism in Germany—especially Thuringia—including its definitions, attitude scales, and trend data. They want datasets, variables, and methodology from studies like the Thüringen Monitor, ALLBUS, and SOCRIS, and how such attitudes relate to democracy, migration, and socio-economic change.	A document is relevant if it directly examines right‑wing extremism (Rechtsextremismus) as a phenomenon or as a measured attitude, for example through definitions, item batteries, scales, trends, or analyses of groups, parties, and societal responses. Clear positives include survey programs like the Thüringen Monitor or ALLBUS that operationalize Rechtsextremismus via items on xenophobia, nationalism, chauvinism, social Darwinism, antisemitism, relativization of National Socialism, and support for a right‑wing dictatorship, or studies of local acceptance, policing, NPD evaluations, and crisis effects on far‑right support. Methodological details (sampling, weighting, variable lists) remain relevant when they specify what and how Rechtsextremismus is measured and reported over time or by region. Documents are non‑relevant if they only mention the term in passing among many topics without substantive content, or if they focus on unrelated politics/economics or other forms of extremism without linking to right‑wing extremism. Edge cases include media content analyses that code “Rechtsextremismus” as a category (relevant if coding rules and findings are described), discussions of right‑wing populism (relevant when explicitly tied to extremist attitudes or organizations), and historical Nazi references (relevant when used as measurement items like “Verharmlosung des Nationalsozialismus,” but not when purely historical without an extremism focus).
3420	left right	The user seeks datasets and survey measures capturing left–right political orientation, including self- and party placement on left–right scales and open-ended associations with “left” and “right,” alongside related attitudes (e.g., extremism, democracy, asylum). The focus is on German and European studies such as ALLBUS 2008, GIP, ICCP, and Euromanifesto data.	A document is relevant to the query “left right” when it uses the terms to denote the political spectrum, for example through self-placement or party placement on a left–right scale or continuum, coding of manifestos by left–right position, or analysis of left- and right-wing extremism. The provided paragraph is highly relevant because it repeatedly references left–right scales, open-ended associations with “left” and “right,” votes by left–right polarity, and survey modules that classify parties and respondents on a left–right continuum (e.g., ALLBUS, GIP, Euromanifesto, and historical voting studies). Documents are non-relevant when “right” means a legal entitlement (e.g., “right to asylum”) or when “left/right” indicates physical direction or layout, without any link to ideological positioning. Edge cases arise when both senses appear; signals such as “scale,” “continuum,” “placement,” “wing,” “polarity,” or “extremism” should tip the judgment toward relevance. Variants like “left-right,” “left wing/right wing,” or synonymous ideological labels (e.g., liberal/conservative) also support relevance.
3474	arbeitszeit	The user seeks historical and statistical information on working time in Germany, including datasets and studies on effective hours, sectoral trends since the 19th century, and the role of unions and policy. They also want survey evidence on schedules, overtime, shift work, and preferences regarding work-time regulation and reduction.	A document is relevant to the query “arbeitszeit” if it substantively treats working time—defining and measuring it (for example, distinguishing nominal vs. effective hours), tracing its historical development (e.g., Meinert’s and Schröder’s estimates for German industry, the 8‑hour day, postwar 48→40 hours), or analyzing concrete scheduling features such as weekly hours, overtime, shift/night/weekend work, core time and flexitime, and tariff or statutory regulations. Material that provides data tables or survey results focused on hours worked (Mikrozensus actual hours vs. enterprise-based paid hours), sectoral differences (textile, metal, mining, construction), or worker preferences for shorter/longer weeks is clearly relevant. Documents become only marginally relevant when “Arbeitszeit” appears as one of many background variables in broader studies (e.g., time-budget diaries or lifestyle surveys listing weekend or partner’s hours) or when the focus is another topic (like European currency or general political attitudes) with just a single item on flexible hours. Edge cases include occupationally narrow studies (e.g., nurses’ shift blocks or farmers’ seasonal hours) which are relevant if they report actual working-time patterns, and references that mention “Arbeitszeit” only in metadata or lists without analysis, which are typically non-relevant.
36787	sustainability	The user seeks datasets and surveys that measure sustainability—especially SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and production—including public awareness, attitudes, and behaviors in Germany. They also want broader European social indicator time series and historical agricultural data relevant to sustainability assessment.	A document is relevant to the query “sustainability” when it explicitly examines sustainability concepts, targets, behaviors, or metrics—for example, surveys on SDG 12 awareness and sustainable consumption, youth studies on environment and climate engagement, or indicator frameworks like the European System of Social Indicators that include a sustainability domain with time series. It is non-relevant when “sustainability” appears only as a passing topic in a broad list (e.g., COVID-19 information surveys that merely include “sustainability” among many interests) or is used in a different sense, such as durability/long-term impact (World Youth Day “impact and sustainability”) or fiscal viability (the “sustainability of the pension system” in euro-related attitudes). Edge cases include agricultural historical time series: these can be relevant if they enable analysis of resource use, yields, and inputs (e.g., fertilizers) tied to sustainable production, but are less relevant if presented solely as production trends without a sustainability framing. Repeated methodological details (CATI, dual-frame sampling) do not by themselves confer relevance unless they support substantive sustainability findings. Duplicate descriptions of the same indicator system add little new value despite using the sustainability label.
37090	stress arbeit	The user is seeking information on work-related stress, including its causes (e.g., workload, time pressure, long hours, job insecurity), prevalence, and health and well-being impacts. They may also want evidence and survey data on how employers assess and manage psychosocial risks and what measures help reduce workplace stress.	A document is relevant to the query “stress arbeit” when it addresses work-related stress, psychosocial risks, or the conditions that generate stress at work, including measurement, causes, consequences, and management. Clear signals include explicit terms like arbeitsbedingter Stress, Arbeitsbedingungen, Arbeitsbelastung, Zeitdruck, Überstunden, Arbeitsdruck, psychosoziale Risiken, and scales of Stress, as in the ESENER surveys and sections that gauge stress, time pressure, and workload or discuss employer measures to handle stress, bullying, and violence. Content linking stress to overtime, job insecurity, unemployment, work–life boundaries, commuting, or organizational changes is also relevant. By contrast, texts that discuss stress unrelated to employment (e.g., medical or exam stress) or discuss Arbeit without any stress dimension (e.g., EU constitution, pensions, or ICT use without mentioning stress) are non-relevant. Edge cases include generic health “stress” items not tied to work, uses of “Stress” in other senses (e.g., stress tests, material stress), or references to “Arbeit” as schoolwork or a thesis; methodological descriptions remain relevant if they center on managing or measuring work-related stress.
38053	social status	The user seeks social science data and surveys on social status and mobility—especially comparisons of respondents’ and parents’ occupational status, self-classification of class, and related demographics. They want variables linking status to political behavior, memberships, religiosity, education, urbanization, and social networks to analyze determinants and consequences of social stratification across populations.	A document is relevant if it explicitly measures or analyzes social status/class, stratification, prestige, or mobility—such as self-assessed social class, interviewer-rated class, assessment of social rank, or comparisons of a respondent’s occupational status with their father’s (intergenerational mobility). Clear positives here include topics like “self assessment of social class,” “assessment of the social prestige of various occupations,” “interviewer rating social class of respondent,” “social mobility,” and “occupational status of respondent in comparison to father status.” Content that lists demographics (age, sex, marital status), memberships, or political attitudes is relevant only when these are used to classify or explain social class/stratification; otherwise, they are peripheral. Edge cases include uses of “status” that are not about social hierarchy—e.g., marital status, employment status, or geopolitical “status of Bosnia and Herzegovina” and “status of Serbs”—which are non-relevant, whereas “occupational status” is relevant if treated as a proxy for social standing. Surveys on social networks or community support are relevant when they contain self-classification or interviewer class ratings; if they only describe contacts or leisure without class/prestige measures, they are not.
38113	social mobility	The user seeks information on social mobility—how people move between social positions across and within generations—and how it is measured. They want studies and datasets (primarily from Germany, with some U.S. context) on occupational, sectoral, and regional mobility and their links to education, class origin, and demographics.	A document is relevant if it examines movement between social strata—typically intergenerational (parent-to-child) or intragenerational (career) mobility—using concrete indicators such as parental occupation/education, respondent occupation, income, prestige scores, or explicit mobility matrices across cohorts. Examples of high relevance include surveys comparing the occupational positions of fathers and respondents (e.g., 1955/1965/1970 panels), status-attainment studies using Siegel prestige scores, or community studies that explicitly code inter- and intragenerational mobility alongside social origins and education. Documents are non-relevant when “mobility” refers only to physical/geographic movement, telecommunications, or technology (e.g., 5G rollouts, mobile phone usage, passive mobile data collection) or when they focus on pensions/politics without measuring class or occupational movement. Edge cases include sectoral or regional mobility studies that are relevant only if they link moves across industries or regions to changes in status/class; likewise, surveys capturing perceived chances of upward mobility or expected occupational change are only marginally relevant if they lack observed transitions. Historical or niche group studies that still code inter-/intragenerational mobility (e.g., a community’s occupational classifications over time) are relevant despite their narrow scope.
38133	sozial	The user is seeking German-language studies and datasets on “sozial” topics, including social media use and political information behavior, social policy and welfare, social housing, social inequality/stratification and mobility, and social security. The goal is to find surveys and analyses profiling attitudes, behaviors, and demographics in these domains in Germany.	A document is relevant to the query “sozial” if it uses the German term or its inflected/compound forms and substantively focuses on social topics, such as soziale Netzwerke, soziale Ungleichheit, Sozialpolitik, sozialer Wohnungsbau, oder soziale Sicherheit. Examples of highly relevant content include studies of intensive users of soziale Netzwerke and their political information behavior, analyses of sozialer Wohnungsbau across federal states, datasets on the Geschichte der Sozialpolitik, and ALLBUS modules on Soziale Ungleichheit, Wohlfahrtsstaat, and soziale Gerechtigkeit. Non-relevant or weakly relevant items are those where “sozial” appears only in passing (e.g., in an institution’s name like „Bundesministerium für Arbeit und Soziales“), in bibliographic boilerplate, or as an isolated variable label without substantive discussion. Edge cases: compounds and derivations (Sozialstaat, Sozialversicherung, sozialpolitisch, Soziale Mobilität) and inflections (soziale/sozialer/sozialen/soziales) should count as matches; occurrences only as English “social” or as a substring in unrelated terms are less likely to be relevant. If the user’s intent is specifically social media, then documents centered on soziale Medien/soziale Netzwerke are most relevant, while broader Sozialpolitik or Wohnungsbau items are thematically social but less on-target.
3856	generationen	The user seeks empirical studies and datasets on “generations,” including Gen Z values, intergenerational mobility, relations and conflicts, demographic change, and first/second migrant generations, with a focus on Germany and the EU. It also spans historical “generations” of industrial technologies (e.g., steelmaking processes) and related statistical tables.	A document is relevant to the query “generationen” if it directly discusses human generations or intergenerational dynamics, such as surveys of Generation Z, intergenerational mobility, Alt–Jung relations, or concepts like the Generationenvertrag. It is also relevant when “Generationen” is used as a technical label or family structure, for example “zweite Generation von Kokshochöfen,” “erste Generation Thomaswerke,” or “Drei‑Generationen‑Familie.” Proper nouns and compound forms containing the token count as well, e.g., “Letzte Generation,” “Generation Jetzt,” “Generationenkonflikte,” “intergenerationelle Transfers,” or references to first/second‑generation immigrants. Non‑relevant documents are those that lack the token, use only unrelated meanings (e.g., English “generation” as power production), or include a single incidental mention in metadata without substantive discussion. Edge cases include hyphenation and declension variants (Generationen-, Drei‑Generationen‑Familie), OCR quirks, and industrial “generation” usages that match the string but are less about age cohorts, which may be keyword‑relevant yet topically peripheral.
3938	gender	The user is seeking survey-based information on gender roles, equality, and discrimination, including time use and division of household labor, employment histories, partner dynamics, and gender role orientations. The goal is to analyze patterns of gender inequality and related attitudes and policies in Europe, especially Germany.	A document is relevant to the query “gender” when it substantively addresses gender roles, equality, discrimination, identity, or gendered behaviors and outcomes—for example, modules on time use and distribution of household tasks, partner history and gender role orientation, women’s employment and the gender pay gap, representation of women in politics, or attitudes toward women in the armed forces. Surveys that assess gender inequality and sexism, own experience of gender or gender identity discrimination, or policy measures to improve work–family balance and women’s participation are clearly relevant. Content focused on unrelated topics such as nuclear power, corruption, healthcare safety, natural hazards, or elections is non-relevant unless it explicitly analyzes differences by gender. Edge cases include documents that only list “sex/gender” as a demographic variable or briefly note a parent’s gender; these are only weakly relevant unless they provide breakdowns or questions centered on gender. Also be cautious with modules labeled “gender roles” that contain little gender-specific content, or uses of “gender” in non-social senses, which would be non-relevant.
39449	sozialleistungen	The user seeks an overview and data on Germany’s social benefits (Sozialleistungen), centered on the federal Sozialbudget—its definition, coverage, classifications (by function, institution, and type), financing sources, and key indicators such as the social benefits-to-GDP ratio. They also want related time-series datasets (including West/East comparisons) and surveys on public attitudes, policy preferences, and the use of social benefits, particularly among low-income groups.	A document is relevant if it defines Sozialleistungen in the German context and details their scope, purpose, and measurement, especially via the Sozialbudget’s classifications by functions, institutions, types of benefits, financing sources, and indicators like the Sozialleistungsquote. It is also relevant if it provides empirical data on social benefits—tables or time series on pensions, unemployment benefits, social assistance, Asylbewerberleistungen, Bürgergeld reforms, or household receipts of monetary transfers, including West–East comparisons or VGR breakdowns that isolate social transfers. Documents are less relevant when they only mention social benefits in passing within political attitude questions or fiscal trade‑offs (e.g., “cut social benefits vs. raise VAT”) without substantive definitions or data. Edge cases include “employer social benefits”: these are relevant only when they correspond to Sozialbudget items such as wage continuation or occupational and supplementary pensions, but not when they are generic corporate perks. Content centered on unrelated topics (defense policy, workplace climate, administrative contacts) or on macro aggregates that do not identify social transfers should be considered non‑relevant.
39506	sozialisation	The user is seeking research and survey data on how socialization in family, school, and broader social contexts shapes authoritarianism, democratic attitudes, and related political orientations among German youth and students. They are particularly interested in measurement scales (e.g., authoritarianism, ethnocentrism, antisemitism), political participation, and demographic correlates across multiple domains.	A document is relevant if it analyzes the processes, agents, and contexts of socialization (e.g., family, school, peers, political institutions, workplace/university) and how they shape attitudes or behavior, especially among youth. Examples include studies using scales on authoritarianism and family authority, surveys of school or political socialization, professional/organizational socialization of students, teachers, elites, fraternities, or even socialization in sports clubs and prisons, ideally with explicit measures, indices, or longitudinal tracking. Demographic blocks and interview metadata support such analyses but, by themselves, do not make a document relevant. Non-relevant items are those that only mention “Sozialisation” tangentially or in other senses (e.g., animal socialization, “socializing” costs in economics), or that discuss attitudes and party preferences without linking them to socialization processes or agents. Edge cases like studies on authority, prejudice, or participation are relevant only when they explicitly connect these outcomes to socializing influences from family, school, peers, or organizations.
40249	soziale herkunft	The user seeks studies and datasets on social origin (family background/class) and its effects on schooling outcomes, educational transitions, spatial/occupational mobility, and related attitudes, mainly in German contexts. They want variables and replication materials measuring parents’ education/occupation, class and wealth indices, grades/test scores, and demographics.	A document is relevant if it directly examines soziale Herkunft (social origin/class background) as a measured variable or concept and links it to outcomes or behaviors, for example studies on school success and grades, educational transitions and spatial mobility (e.g., NEPS analyses), or occupational prestige, class identification, and parental education/occupation. Dataset descriptions are also relevant when they include concrete variables capturing social origin (father’s job, parental education, class/Schichtzugehörigkeit) or report results such as the social origin of medical or sports students. Historical analyses that present tables on students’ social background or discuss how social origin shaped professionalization count as relevant. Non-relevant or weakly relevant items include documents where Herkunft refers only to regional/ethnic origin, or where “soziale Herkunft” appears merely in a long demographic checklist without analysis or findings tied to it (e.g., surveys on dialect or housing that just record social origin). Edge cases include replication files that analyze social-origin effects (relevant), and surveys on mobility that mention social origin among controls but never interpret it (borderline).
4027	migrationshintergrund	The query seeks datasets and research on people with a migration background in Germany, with a focus on higher education (equality work, students and academic staff), support structures, and policy. It also covers integration experiences, discrimination and racism, labor market and hiring experiments, political attitudes and participation, neighborhood diversity and social networks, and religiosity.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses “Migrationshintergrund” (migration background) as a core concept—e.g., comparing people with and without migration background, reporting shares of students or staff with migration background, or using it as a sampling or analytical variable in surveys or experiments. Examples include university equality work that covers support and discrimination by ethnic origin for students and scientific staff with migration background, nationwide surveys on values or racism among Germans with and without migration background, election studies of groups defined by origin (e.g., Turkish or ex‑Soviet), or hiring experiments where “Migrationshintergrund” is an experimental factor. Documents that operationalize the concept indirectly—such as distinguishing “Deutsche mit/ohne Migrationshintergrund,” onomastic name-based classification, second/third generation markers, or neighborhood measures of residents with migration background—are also relevant. Non‑relevant are items that discuss migration in general without defining or measuring “Migrationshintergrund,” equality topics with no migrant dimension, or texts where the term appears only incidentally (e.g., a single variable label) without substantive analysis; clearly unrelated uses like data or animal “migration” are out. Edge cases include studies that only restrict a subsample (e.g., parents of youths without migration background) or mention the term in metadata—these are borderline unless they provide definitions, data, or findings about groups by migration background.
4034	soziale ungleichheit	The user seeks survey-based datasets and analyses on social inequality—its determinants, perceptions, and consequences—focusing mainly on Germany (with some references to Poland), covering socioeconomic status, mobility, education, income, health, and political attitudes. They are looking for resources like ALLBUS and ISSP modules, GISD, TwinLife, and IQB studies to enable trend and comparative assessments.	A document is relevant if it directly addresses social inequality—e.g., measures or discusses socioeconomic status, income distribution, social mobility, education and occupational stratification, deprivation indices (such as a German deprivation index), or public attitudes toward inequality and the welfare state, ideally with empirical data from surveys like ALLBUS or ISSP. Content that analyzes mechanisms and consequences of inequality (acceptance of inequality across classes, intergenerational comparisons, regional disparities, or links to health outcomes) is highly relevant, as are studies on related domains like educational disparities, labor-market status, or political trust when explicitly tied to inequality. Materials focused mainly on other topics (national identity, religion, or general politics) without an explicit connection to social inequality, or purely methodological/administrative notes about surveys without inequality measures, are less relevant. Edge cases include documents on specific subtypes (gender inequality, migration-related disparities, or digital divide) which are relevant if framed as aspects of social inequality, and pieces using “Ungleichheit” in non-social senses (e.g., mathematical inequalities) which are non-relevant.
40380	soziale lage	The query seeks research and survey data on “soziale Lage” (socioeconomic status and living conditions), especially in Germany, including subjective perceptions, social mobility, inequality, and related attitudes toward poverty, wealth, and marginalized groups.	A document is relevant to the query “soziale lage” if it explicitly analyzes social position or strata (soziale Lagen) of individuals or groups, operationalized through socio-economic indicators, class/stratification schemes, or mobility, and not merely general “situational” assessments. Highly relevant examples include studies using a multidimensional typology of social strata, qualitative interviews on perceived social mobility and participation among disadvantaged groups, historical analyses of poverty records (“soziale und ökonomische Lage” of the house-poor), or datasets detailing the social position of professions (e.g., shoemakers) or academics, with variables like income, education, occupation, household structure, and “Schichtzugehörigkeit.” Documents that only discuss the general or economic situation (“wirtschaftliche Lage,” “Lage Berlins,” “weltpolitische Lage”) without linking it to social status, stratification, or inequalities are non-relevant. Edge cases can be surveys listing “soziale Lage,” “soziale Integration,” or “soziale Gerechtigkeit” among many themes: they are relevant if they provide measures or analysis tied to social positioning, but weakly relevant if the term appears only as a checklist item. Synonyms and close concepts such as “soziale und wirtschaftliche Situation,” “soziale Mobilität,” “Schicht,” and “sozialer Auf- bzw. Abstieg” strengthen relevance, whereas pure market research or media-use studies without a social-status frame do not.
40505	soziale kontakte	The user is looking for studies and data on social contacts in Germany—how often and with whom different groups (e.g., refugees, guest workers, homeless, elderly, students, professionals) interact in neighborhoods, friendships, and workplaces. They want to understand how factors like housing type and demographics affect social integration, networks, and well-being.	A document is relevant if it explicitly examines social interactions or networks—such as the frequency and context of contacts with neighbors, friends, colleagues, or members of other groups—and links these contacts to integration, well‑being, or community life. Examples include studies reporting contacts between refugees and Germans in the neighborhood, surveys of older adults on how often they meet family and friends, or instruments measuring contacts with Gastarbeiter at work, in the family, or friendship circles, as well as research on homeless residents’ contacts to non-homeless or young Aussiedlers’ friendship and leisure contacts. It may also be relevant if it captures related indicators like time spent with others, neighborhood ties, or club/association membership as proxies for social contacts. By contrast, documents that focus mainly on economic conditions, policy assessments, or demographics without measuring interpersonal interactions, or that use “contact” in a procedural/institutional sense (e.g., interviewer contact attempts, contacts with authorities) are non-relevant. Edge cases include broad multi-topic surveys: they are relevant if they contain substantive items on contact frequency or networks, but not if “contact” appears only as a technical fieldwork note or phone/communication access variable.
40541	soziale kompetenzen	The user seeks an explanation of social competencies (social skills), including their definition, key components, and ways to assess or develop them. The focus may be on German educational and institutional contexts where such competencies are surveyed or evaluated.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses social competencies (Sozialkompetenz), such as interpersonal communication, empathy, cooperation, teamwork, conflict resolution, prosocial behavior, or social-emotional learning, including their definition, development, assessment, or training. Studies reporting validated scales or interventions (e.g., classroom SEL programs, workplace soft-skill training, SOKO-type measures) or curriculum frameworks that include a “social competence” domain count as relevant. Documents are non-relevant when “Kompetenz” refers to institutional/political competence (e.g., competence of parties, police, Bundestag) or to academic competencies in math/science, or when “sozial” refers to social policy, institutions, or demographics rather than interpersonal skills. Edge cases include mentions of “soziales Engagement” or “soziale Zusammensetzung”: these are not relevant unless they explicitly link engagement/composition to individuals’ social skill levels; similarly, higher-education “study competence” is irrelevant unless it includes a social-skills subscale. Useful synonyms and cues include Sozialkompetenz, sozial-emotionale Kompetenzen, Soft Skills, zwischenmenschliche Fähigkeiten, Empathie, Teamfähigkeit, Kommunikationskompetenz, as well as terms like Skala, Validierung, Intervention, Training.
40674	soziale arbeit	The user seeks a comprehensive overview of Germany’s social welfare system and social policy, tracing their historical development, legal foundations, and major programs (health, pensions, accident and unemployment insurance, social assistance). They also want access to statistical tables and surveys on beneficiaries, financing, contribution rates, and social outcomes such as inequality, labor market dynamics, and quality of life.	A document is relevant to the query “soziale arbeit” when it addresses the practice and delivery of social services, the client groups and settings of social work, or the legal and organizational frameworks that govern it (for example Sozialhilfe and Grundsicherung under SGB XII/SGB II, Jugendhilfe, Pflegeversicherung, Asylbewerberleistungen, or “Soziale Infrastruktur und soziale Dienste”). Parts of this text are relevant because they compile data and history on Germany’s welfare systems and social services, including tables on Sozialhilfe, Jugendhilfe, family policy, care for the elderly, and the social service infrastructure that social workers operate within. Content focused mainly on social insurance financing, contribution rates, accident insurance, labor court statistics, or the professionalization of physicians and industrial workplace studies is non-relevant unless it clearly links to social work practice, clients, or service provision. Edge cases include historical overviews of social policy (Bismarckian laws, Weimar/BRD reforms) or surveys on inequality and older people’s living conditions, which become relevant when used to contextualize mandates, needs assessments, or interventions in social work but are otherwise peripheral. Highly relevant documents provide micro-level details on service users, eligibility, casework processes, and the roles of agencies like Jugendamt or Jobcenter; largely non-relevant ones stay at macroeconomic indicators or sectors unrelated to social services.
41495	soziale medien	The user seeks empirical studies or datasets about social media usage and its effects—especially on political information, discourse, credibility, hate speech, and polarization—as well as government communication on social platforms. The focus is largely on Germany and Europe and also includes the use of social media within digital learning contexts.	A document is highly relevant to the query “soziale medien” when it substantively discusses social media platforms, usage, attitudes, or effects—for example, studies of intensive social media users, platform rankings (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, YouTube, WhatsApp), hate speech experiences, credibility of information in social networks, or political information behavior on these platforms. Content analyzing policy or civic communication in or about social media (e.g., government information offers on social networks, regulation of online harassment, or the ValCon project on social media and populism) also fits well. Partial or marginal relevance occurs when social media is only one item in a broader “digital media” or education survey (e.g., lists of tools where Facebook/Twitter/Instagram are mentioned among many apps) or when social media appears as one of several crisis information channels in a disaster study. Non-relevant documents focus on unrelated media or topics without a clear social-media angle—such as general media use (radio/TV/print), video gaming habits without social platforms, or legal/professional surveys that mention “Mediennutzung” but not social networks. Edge cases include texts using synonyms like “soziale Netzwerke,” discussions that use only platform names without the phrase “soziale medien” (still relevant), or documents where “soziale” and “Medien” appear separately without referring to social media (not relevant).
41546	soziale netzwerke	The user seeks empirical studies and survey data on social networks/social media, including usage frequency and purposes, device preferences, credibility/trust, and interactions with political content. The focus is on how network ties shape information behavior, political attitudes and participation, and social integration, with consideration of demographics and government communication channels.	A document is relevant to “soziale netzwerke” if it focuses on social networks, whether as online social media (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, YouTube, WhatsApp) or as interpersonal network structures in sociology (ties, homophily, diffusion, support). Highly relevant cues include detailed treatment of usage frequency, purposes, devices, political information encounters, credibility and fake news, and government communication on social platforms, all of which appear here. Also clearly relevant are empirical analyses of offline networks—such as school-class network co-evolution (CILS4EU), social support and integration among DDR migrants, American city friendship and association networks, ISSP modules on social relationships, and measures of network size, contact frequency, and tie characteristics. Borderline cases are studies where social networks are only a small subsection (e.g., broader media or gaming surveys that merely include a short “social network” battery), while non-relevant items would use “Netzwerke” in a purely technical sense (computer networks) or mention the term without substantive analysis. Overall, this document is highly relevant because it centers on social networks across multiple contexts—social media and offline relational networks—with rich, concrete variables and outcomes.
4160	stress	The user seeks datasets and studies measuring perceived stress and stress-related behaviors across populations—especially hospital employees—and contexts such as work, family, health, and COVID-19, to understand stress levels, determinants, coping, and outcomes.	A document is relevant if it directly measures, analyzes, or reports on psychological or occupational stress as an experienced burden, typically via variables or scales (e.g., degree of perceived stress, individual reaction to stress at work, job/ward stress averages). Strong matches include surveys of hospital employees’ work stress, COVID-19 supplements capturing stresses, health surveys with perceived stress by problems and feelings, family/child-related stress, and stress in school or work contexts, as well as “conduct in stress situations.” Content is also relevant when stress is tied to specific contexts or behaviors, such as stress from commuting routes, menstruation-related stress, stress from intoxicant use or gambling, and work stress alongside satisfaction. Non-relevant material uses “stress” only as a verb meaning emphasize (e.g., “stressing positive characteristics” of coin designs) or mentions stress in passing without measures, variables, or analysis. Edge cases are broad, multi-topic datasets; they count as relevant when they include explicit stress items (e.g., perceived stress scales, job stress, work stress and satisfaction) but not when they describe unrelated domains without operationalizing stress.
41655	soziale mobilität	The user is seeking research and data on social mobility—definitions and types (occupational, sectoral, regional; inter- and intragenerational), its determinants such as social origin and education, and implications for social participation and societal openness, especially in German and U.S. contexts. They want studies and methods (qualitative and quantitative) that analyze mobility patterns and trajectories over time.	A document is relevant if it explicitly examines social mobility—such as intergenerational or intragenerational moves between social strata or occupations—and links movements in jobs, sectors, education, or regions to social origin, class position, or prestige (e.g., father–son occupation comparisons, Siegel prestige scores, ARB Survey, NEPS-based analyses). Studies that analyze occupational, sectoral, or regional mobility as pathways of status change, or treat mobility as an indicator of societal openness, are clearly on-target; for example, historical local studies of vertical occupational mobility or work on educational transitions that tie geographic distance to parental education are relevant. Mixed-methods or qualitative work that explores perceived chances of upward mobility, barriers to participation, and coping patterns in disadvantaged strata also qualifies. By contrast, documents that reference “mobility” only as physical relocation, commuting, or resettlement without connecting it to status, class, or social origin are not relevant, nor are bare variable lists without analysis of stratification dynamics. Edge cases include datasets or replication files that are relevant only when they accompany analyses of status movement, and studies of geographic mobility that count if they explicitly demonstrate consequences for educational or labor-market returns by social background.
4182	stress am arbeitsplatz	The user is seeking information on workplace stress, especially psychosocial risks like work-related stress, bullying, and violence, and how organizations manage them. They likely want survey-based evidence (e.g., ESENER) on prevalence, risk factors, employer policies, barriers, and interventions to prevent and address stress at work in Europe.	A document is relevant to “stress am arbeitsplatz” if it addresses work-related stress or psychosocial risks at work, such as time pressure, high workload, overtime, harassment/mobbing, violence, work-life conflict, or organizational measures to assess and manage these risks (e.g., risk assessments, ESENER survey findings, management procedures, and employee participation). Detailed questionnaires or results that measure stress, “Arbeitsbelastung,” “Zeitdruck,” or “psychosoziale Risiken,” and describe interventions or barriers (training, policies, effectiveness) are highly relevant. By contrast, material about unrelated topics (e.g., EU constitution, general ICT use, household income, student timetable stress, general health behaviors) or “stress” in a non-work or non-psychological sense (e.g., mechanical stress) is non-relevant. Edge cases include documents that discuss workplace safety only in terms of physical hazards without mentioning psychological strain (weakly relevant) or texts that merely list “Stress” among many items without substantive treatment (low relevance). Mentions in German synonyms like “arbeitsbedingter Stress,” “Belastung,” and “psychosoziale Risiken” should count, but the focus must remain explicitly on the workplace context.
427	migration	The user seeks comprehensive datasets and surveys on migration, spanning migrant demographics, labor migration and return trajectories, integration outcomes and public attitudes, and international migration flow statistics. They want micro- and macro-level data (historical and contemporary, especially for Germany/Europe) to analyze social, economic, and family effects of migration.	A document is relevant to the query “migration” when it addresses human mobility across borders or regions and provides substantive information on migrants, flows, or consequences of migration, such as surveys of migrant workers and returnees, international migration statistics (e.g., Ferenczi & Willcox/NBER–ILO compilations), immigration statistics for Canada, Vienna time-series on migration flows, or German panel studies like GERPS on emigrants/remigrants. Analyses of migration-related subtopics—e.g., the social roles of wives of returned migrants, attitudes toward immigration, migrants’ job satisfaction, political behavior of groups with a migration background, or children’s educational trajectories by migration background—are also strongly relevant, especially when they include measures like duration of stay, reasons for migration, remittances, or integration outcomes. By contrast, content using “migration” in other domains (IT/data migration, animal migration) or sections offering only general demography, health, or environment without a migration component (e.g., hospital or air quality tables unlinked to migrants) is non-relevant. Edge cases include items labeled “population movement” or “foreign persons” that are relevant if they quantify migration flows or biographies, while brief passing mentions of “migration background” or duplicated metadata are only weakly relevant unless tied to concrete migration variables or analyses.
43444	consumer	The user is seeking empirical survey data on consumer issues—especially awareness and use of consumer rights, trust in institutions, media exposure, product safety, and consumer behavior—primarily in European contexts (notably Poland and Germany) with demographic detail. They also want insights into retailers’ knowledge of and compliance with consumer legislation and obstacles to cross‑border online sales.	A document is relevant if it directly focuses on consumers or consumer issues, such as consumer rights and protection, consumer behavior and education, consumer price indices, or institutions and laws that safeguard or inform consumers. Examples include surveys on Polish consumer rights and media attention to them, evaluations of consumer protection organizations like Federacja Konsumentów, studies of retailers’ compliance with consumer legislation and ADR, and official statistics like the consumer price index for households. Material framed from the business or regulatory side is still relevant when its core is the impact on or treatment of consumers (e.g., monitoring of unfair commercial practices, product safety oversight, or companies’ knowledge of consumer law). A document is non-relevant if “consumer” is merely incidental in a broader topic (e.g., environmental protection without a consumer angle), appears only in metadata, or uses “consumer” in another domain (software queue consumers or ecological food-chain consumers). Edge cases include texts about “consumption” or “customers” without the word “consumer”—these can be relevant if they clearly target end-users/households—and mixed-topic surveys are relevant only when they contain substantial, not passing, modules on consumer matters.
43910	covid	The user wants information on COVID-19-related surveys and longitudinal studies—especially in Germany and the EU—covering behaviors, attitudes, compliance with regulations, vaccination views, and socioeconomic and health impacts. They seek datasets/study documentation with details on target populations, sampling, modes, and survey waves/time frames.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses the COVID-19 pandemic (SARS‑CoV‑2), such as surveys or analyses of behaviors, health, socioeconomic impacts, compliance with regulations, vaccination attitudes, or lockdown effects. In this paragraph, items like TwinLife’s 2020–2021 COVID-19 supplemental waves, the U COMPLY panel on adherence to COVID-19 rules, the EU “Women in times of COVID‑19” survey, the ENTRA additional COVID-19 module, and forsa’s repeated population surveys on the “Corona crisis” are all clearly relevant. Content that only describes general study designs, twin genetics, or immigrant integration without linking outcomes to the pandemic would be non-relevant for the query. Edge cases include documents that use related terms (Corona, pandemic, lockdown, vaccination status, non‑compliance) without the exact string “covid” which should still count as relevant, while mentions of “Corona” in non-pandemic contexts or mere date markers like “during COVID” without substantive COVID-related measures would not. Repetition of the same COVID survey description is still relevant but adds no additional unique value.
44361	culture	The user seeks an overview of empirical studies and survey data on cultural education and participation, especially in Germany, covering digital transformation (e.g., in public libraries), parental influences, municipal funding, and patterns of cultural engagement across arts and media. They want to understand how these factors shape access, participation, and policy in culture.	For the query “culture,” documents are most relevant when they substantively address cultural practices, education, participation, institutions, values, or media representations, not just mention the word in passing. Examples of high relevance include surveys on how public libraries shape digital cultural education, panel studies of cultural participation across music, film, literature and gaming, or analyses of municipal funding and coordination of cultural education—like the library digitization study, the KuBiPaD panel, and the cities’ financing survey described here. Mixed-topic social surveys are relevant if the culture modules are detailed and central (e.g., EU polls on cultural activities, values, and access), while items where “culture” is incidental—such as a transport or poverty report with a single question on museum visits—are borderline; documents using “culture” in a different sense (cell culture in biology or brief corporate-culture slogans) are non-relevant. Edge cases include locality studies where culture is examined via media narratives about rural areas or youth-leisure research tied to cultural activities (e.g., FDJ-related cultural engagement), which are relevant when they provide definition, measures, services, or outcomes. Overall, depth and specificity to cultural content and policy make a document more relevant, whereas bare methodology, demographic tables, or tangential uses of the term reduce relevance.
4472	stress work	The user is seeking information on work-related stress and working conditions, including surveys or measures that capture hours, shift work, job demands, and commuting stress. They also want related variables and outcomes such as health complaints, job satisfaction, and family/housing context across different occupations and study waves.	A document is relevant to “stress work” when it discusses stress in the context of employment or the workplace, such as perceived work stress, job stress scales, workload or deadline pressure, shift or night work, overtime, commuting stress to and from work, and health complaints occurring during or after work. Examples that strongly match include sections on “working conditions and stress at work,” “deadline stress,” “lifting heavy loads, noise, hazardous materials,” “perceived change of work stress,” “mobbing,” “psychological and physical disturbances to health from work,” and ward-level job stress among hospital employees. Content is borderline but potentially relevant when stress is tied to employment indirectly (e.g., “stress from the route to work,” stress among professional drivers due to achievement pressure, or stress from household work if framed as occupational labor). By contrast, material on family or partnership problems, stress from children, menstruation complaints, sexuality, housing satisfaction, leisure culture, or general health behaviors is non-relevant unless explicitly linked to work conditions. Edge cases: synonyms like job strain, occupational stress, workload pressure, and burnout are relevant, whereas “stress tests,” material/engineering stress, or school-only stress are not.
45770	climate change attitudes	The user is looking for survey-based insights on public attitudes toward climate change and climate protection, including perceived risks, support for and awareness of specific policy measures, energy transition assessments, and personal behavior changes. They seek data—primarily from Germany and the EU—with demographic breakdowns to compare opinions across actors, sectors, and policies.	A document is relevant if it measures people’s beliefs, concern, or judgments about climate change and climate protection, including attribution (human-caused vs natural), perceived risks, and support or opposition to specific policies. Clear examples include surveys on opinions of a CO2 tax, motorway speed limits, kerosene taxes, higher VAT on meat, coal phase-out timelines, EV subsidies and charging expansion, individual actions (eating less meat, flying/driving less), willingness to pay higher energy prices, and confidence in the energy transition. Also relevant are attitudes toward which actors should do the most (government, industry, citizens), perceptions of lobbying’s influence on EU climate policy, trust in institutions on climate, and self-reported climate-friendly behaviors. Non-relevant are documents that only present climate science, emissions data, technology assessments, or policy descriptions without public opinion, as well as general political/economic surveys lacking a climate-attitudes component or pages with only demographic/method metadata. Edge cases: broader environmental-attitudes or transport/energy-transition studies are relevant if they explicitly capture opinions or behavioral intentions linked to climate change, while modules on biodiversity or chemical product safety are out of scope unless directly tied to climate change attitudes.
45793	climate	The user is looking for survey-based insights on public attitudes in Germany toward climate change and climate protection, including concerns, responsibility of different actors, and support for specific policies (e.g., CO2 tax, transport, energy, building measures). They want representative study results with demographic breakdowns and methodological details from recurring government-commissioned polls.	A document is relevant to the query “climate” when it substantively addresses climate change or climate protection, such as public attitudes, policy measures, mitigation and adaptation strategies, or the energy transition. This includes surveys or analyses discussing actors’ roles (government, industry, citizens), sector contributions (transport, energy, buildings, agriculture), and concrete measures like CO2 taxes, electric vehicle subsidies, speed limits, kerosene taxes, or public-transport tickets (e.g., the Deutschlandticket). Content that only mentions “climate” tangentially—such as administrative survey metadata, coding variables, or unrelated policy areas (health technology assessment, GDPR) without a clear link to climate policy—would be non-relevant; likewise, uses of “climate” as a metaphor (business climate, political climate) are not relevant. Edge cases include documents focused on natural disasters or flooding that explicitly connect impacts to climate change (relevant), or mixed-topic datasets where a substantial module analyzes climate policy or lobbying’s influence on EU climate policy (relevant), even if other modules are unrelated. Brief, passing references to climate without analysis, findings, or policy context would not meet the bar for relevance.
4600	gewalt	The user is seeking studies and survey data on violence (Gewalt) that cover prevalence and forms (domestic/gender-based, youth/school, political/xenophobic), perpetrators and victims, health and social impacts, reporting behavior, risk factors across demographics, and prevention/policy measures. Focus is on Germany and the EU, including trends since reunification and in conflict-affected contexts.	The German keyword “Gewalt” (violence) makes a document relevant when it substantively treats violence as a topic—e.g., prevalence, forms (domestic, sexualized, school, political/xenophobic), perpetrators and victims, attitudes and norms toward violence, causes, prevention, reporting behavior, health impacts, or policy responses. Studies or surveys describing modules on häusliche Gewalt gegen Frauen, Gewaltbereitschaft, Gewaltanwendung an Schulen, Gewalt gegen Ausländer, sexual harassment, stalking, or victimization are clearly relevant, even if listed among many other themes. Content that only name-drops “Gewalt” in a long keyword list without analysis is weakly relevant, while texts using near-synonyms like Übergriffe, Misshandlung, oder Viktimisierung can still be relevant if they clearly address violent acts. Non-relevant hits include homographs and idioms such as Gewaltenteilung (separation of powers), höhere Gewalt (force majeure), or the adjective gewaltig (huge), as well as general political or EU topics that lack a violence component. Borderline cases include defense or security-policy discussions that mention violence only tangentially; they become relevant when they assess experiences, risks, or measures related to violent acts.
46134	care arbeit	The user is seeking information on care work (Care-Arbeit), particularly unpaid family caregiving and children’s assistance with household/family care. They are interested in how these responsibilities were experienced or distributed during the COVID-19 period in Germany (and possibly Ghana).	For the query “care arbeit,” documents are relevant when they address care work (Care-Arbeit) such as unpaid family caregiving, childcare, eldercare, domestic care tasks, or paid care labor, including how these duties are distributed, experienced, or supported. In this paragraph, the World Vision Children’s Study explicitly mentions “assistance with family care work” during the COVID-19 crisis, which is directly relevant; mentions of “Betreuung der Kinder” (childcare) can also be relevant if tied to caregiving responsibilities or burdens. By contrast, materials about general work or labor statistics, home office and work addiction, wage and hours indices, or job satisfaction are non-relevant unless they link specifically to caregiving or domestic care responsibilities. Mentions of “health care,” Electronic Health Care Records, or the NGO “CARE” are likely false positives unless they explicitly discuss caregiving work and its performance. Edge cases include references to “Hausarbeit” or family versus work comparisons, which are relevant only if they analyze the performance or load of care/household work rather than mentioning it in passing.
4690	gesundheit	The user seeks comprehensive, survey-based information and datasets on health and healthcare—particularly in Germany and Europe—covering occupational safety and psychosocial risks, public health behaviors and attitudes, healthcare systems, and health expenditures. They are interested in sources, methodologies, and variables from studies such as ESENER, ISSP, Eurobarometer, and national panels.	A document is relevant to the query “gesundheit” if it substantively discusses health, healthcare, or health-related topics, including public or occupational health, individual health behaviors, health systems and insurance, health expenditures, or policy (e.g., surveys on workplace safety and psychosocial risks like ESENER, datasets on German health expenditures, ISSP Health modules, studies on AIDS prevention, environmental impacts on health, or local “Gesundheit und Pflege” needs in aging). Keyword and compound matches in German such as Gesundheitswesen, Gesundheitsschutz, Gesundheitsausgaben, Gesundheitsversorgung, and related terms like Pflege, Krankenversicherung, Prävention, oder Arbeitsschutz strengthen relevance, as do sections on mental health, SRHR, or preventive screenings. Mixed-topic surveys remain relevant if they contain a clearly described health module or analysis, even when health is only one of several themes. A document is non-relevant if “Gesundheit” appears only as a passing value in a list (e.g., a generic ranking of life priorities), as the sneeze exclamation “Gesundheit!”, in brand/place names containing “gesund,” or in safety/finance texts without a concrete health angle. Edge cases include economic or legal reports that qualify only when tied explicitly to health spending, services, or outcomes, and materials in which “gesund” (healthy) is used adjectivally without meaningful health content.
47291	drug	The user is looking for survey-based insights on public and youth attitudes and behaviors related to drugs, especially in Germany and across Europe. They want information on prevalence and contexts of use, perceived risks, motives, access, social networks, and opinions on prevention, legalization, punishment, and institutional responses, often alongside alcohol and tobacco.	A document is relevant if it substantively discusses drugs in the sense of use, abuse, access, attitudes, policy, or health risks—especially surveys of public or youth opinions, prevalence, motives, and measures to combat drug problems (e.g., personal contact with drug users, perceived availability within 24 hours, legalization debates, testing at school/work, sentencing vs. therapy). Content on specific substances (illicit drugs, “intoxicants,” cannabis, ecstasy, heroin, cocaine) and related topics like alcohol/nicotine as “entry drugs,” risk assessments, and cross-country comparisons are highly relevant. Examples include Eurobarometer modules on why people try drugs, who youths would ask for information, and judgments on the effectiveness of anti-drug campaigns. Non-relevant are pieces where “drug” appears only incidentally or in unrelated senses—such as pharmaceutical marketing, routine medical treatments, or “drugstore” mentions—without discussion of drug use/abuse, policy, or access; likewise, items solely about alcohol/tobacco with no link to illegal drugs may be borderline. Edge cases include AIDS or general health surveys: they are relevant if they address drug use, testing, or policy (e.g., urine tests, harm, dependence), but not if drugs are mentioned only as medications in passing.
4811	ukraine	Find survey-based evidence on the Ukraine war focusing on German public attitudes, information behavior/media use, misinformation, and foreign policy views, plus EU surveys on displaced Ukrainians’ integration, with details on methods, samples, and waves (2022–2024) from forsa/Info Markt and FRA.	A document is relevant if it substantively focuses on Ukraine—such as the war, its effects on Germany and the EU, public opinion about the conflict, media and information behavior, refugee experiences, and related policies. Examples include the forsa “Crisis Monitor” and Info Markt studies on attitudes toward the Ukraine war, news use and credibility, as well as the EU FRA survey of people displaced from Ukraine and discussion of the Temporary Protection Directive. Material that only name-checks Ukraine within a broad foreign policy or TTIP discussion, or pages dominated by sampling frames and fieldwork logistics without reporting Ukraine-related findings, are less relevant. Edge cases include repeated listings of survey waves that are still relevant if they track Ukraine-related questions, while mentions of Ukraine in long country lists or as a brief historical aside may not meet the user’s likely intent for information about Ukraine itself.
4835	media	Find information on AGMA’s annual Media Analyse surveys of media usage in Germany. The user likely wants data and reports on press and electronic media (TV, radio) consumption across the 1990s–2002, including related youth leisure and media behavior.	For the query “media,” documents are relevant when they discuss mass communication channels (press, television, radio, digital), patterns of media use, audiences, or industry actors such as advertising agencies and media research bodies. For example, the paragraph on AGMA’s Media Analyse describes annual surveys of German media usage, sampling and interview methods, and multiple waves focused on press and electronic media as well as youth media behavior—clearly matching the query. Non-relevant results would use “media” in other senses (e.g., biological culture media, data storage media, or artistic mediums) or as a proper noun/place name without any connection to mass communication. Edge cases include texts where “media” appears only in an organization’s title or in boilerplate repeated text; these are weak or tangential unless they actually analyze media consumption, availability, or advertising contexts. Time-bounded studies (e.g., 1992–2002 waves) are still relevant to “media” broadly, though they may be less suitable if the user’s intent is specifically about current social or digital media trends.
49615	digitalization	The user seeks comprehensive, representative survey data on digitalization in Germany and Europe—especially in education (schools, universities, further training), workplaces, public services/libraries, and privacy. They want evidence on adoption, attitudes, benefits, challenges, and policy responses (e.g., OER, e-assessment, infrastructure), with demographic breakdowns.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses digitalization/digitization as a social, organizational, or policy transformation—such as the adoption, use, impacts, strategies, and governance of digital media and technologies. Clear fits include surveys of digital learning in schools, universities, and further education (equipment, OER, e-assessment, blended learning), public services going digital, broadband expansion, data protection and cybercrime, workplace “Work 4.0” changes, and library digital transformation, as well as expert panels on digital privacy. Items focused mainly on EU politics or Brexit are only relevant where they explicitly analyze hopes/fears, policies, or consequences related to digitization; likewise, broad value surveys (e.g., EVS) qualify when they contain modules on internet use or attitudes toward digital tech. Non-relevant materials are those that only list demographics or administrative codes, or that mention digital tools in passing without discussing adoption, effects, or policy tasks. Edge cases: scanning/archiving “digitization” is borderline unless tied to wider digital transformation; synonyms like “digital change,” “digital transformation,” “Industry 4.0,” and “e-learning” also indicate relevance.
50072	digital	The user seeks representative surveys and datasets on digitalization—especially digital learning and media use—in Germany and Europe, covering attitudes, practices, infrastructure, and challenges across education, work, and cultural institutions. They are looking for sources like the Digital Education Monitor, European Values Study, and TAPP Panel that capture public and expert perspectives, including on digital privacy and “Work 4.0.”	A document is relevant to the query “digital” when it substantively discusses digitization or digital technologies—such as digital learning platforms (e.g., Moodle, ILIAS), e-assessment systems, open educational resources, digital privacy and regulation, or policy and infrastructure topics like fast internet/WLAN expansion and cybersecurity—rather than merely mentioning the word. Materials that center on the “Monitor Digitale Bildung,” digital media in universities and schools, digital testing, libraries’ digital transformation, or Work 4.0 and attitudes toward digitization clearly match the query. Content where “digital” appears only in passing within a broader, unrelated topic (e.g., a survey mostly about EU politics or general values, with a brief nod to digitalization) would be only marginally relevant. Edge cases include “digital” used as a brand name or in non-technical senses (e.g., digits/fingers), which are non-relevant, and long equipment lists (smartphones, projectors, digital cameras) that are relevant only if tied to analysis of digital learning or services rather than cataloging items. Duplicate or boilerplate mentions of “digital” without explanatory context also reduce relevance.
50270	digital skills	The user is seeking surveys and datasets on digital skills and digitization in Germany across work and education, including competencies, internet use, digital learning practices, and attitudes toward digital change/AI. They want measured results and demographics on literacy and digital consumer competence, workplace impacts (Work 4.0), institutional readiness, challenges, and related policy implications.	A document is relevant if it explicitly measures, describes, or develops digital skills or competencies, such as tests of digital consumer competence, self-assessments of media or internet skills, training participation in digital learning, or employer demands for digital qualifications. Surveys that evaluate skill gaps, workforce upskilling needs in the context of digitization (e.g., “skills and qualifications for the future world of work”), or the effectiveness of digital education programs also qualify as relevant. Content focused mainly on infrastructure or usage (hardware availability, OER catalogs, platform usage) is only weakly relevant unless it ties usage to learners’ or workers’ abilities and outcomes; for example, a library’s digital transformation becomes relevant if it includes programs that teach digital literacy. Documents about immigration attitudes, EU politics, or general digitization attitudes without a competence component, as well as pure demographic descriptions, are non-relevant. Edge cases include general literacy studies that also report “digital practices and basic skills,” or AI-use surveys that assess capability or training; these are relevant only if they quantify or evaluate users’ digital competence.
5030	sicherheitsgefühl	The user is looking for surveys and datasets that measure “Sicherheitsgefühl” (sense of security), including perceptions of personal and public safety, fear of crime, and victimization. They want indicators, trends, and demographic breakdowns, plus related attitudes toward security policies and institutions, primarily in Germany with some comparative contexts.	A document is relevant if it directly discusses people’s perceived sense of safety (Sicherheitsgefühl), measures it in surveys, or analyzes factors that influence it, such as fear of crime, victimization, trust in police, or differences by place and time (e.g., daytime vs. nighttime, neighborhood, public transport). Examples include city studies like “Leben in Frankfurt,” national surveys on inner security in Germany, modules on internet security feelings (Sicherheitsempfinden online), or research linking policies (CCTV, airport controls, data retention) to changes in perceived safety. Content in other contexts that still measures the public’s Sicherheitsgefühl—such as studies in Macedonia or Iraq, or Bundeswehr/ZMSBw surveys that include threat perception and safety feelings—also counts; synonyms like “Sicherheitsempfinden” or phrases like “Gefühl der Sicherheit” are relevant. A document is non-relevant if it focuses only on objective security/defense policy, crime rates, or institutional measures without asking about or reporting people’s subjective safety feelings, or if “Sicherheit” appears without any experiential or perceptual dimension. Edge cases include documents that mention the term only in passing (e.g., a long topic list with no results or analysis), purely technical IT-security pieces that lack user feeling measures, or marketing copy that uses “gives a feeling of security” without empirical discussion.
505	diskriminierung	The user seeks comprehensive survey-based information on discrimination in Germany and across the EU, including experiences, attitudes, prevalence, and drivers across domains like employment, education, housing, health, and services. They also want comparisons between affected and non-affected groups (e.g., migrants, ethnic minorities, Roma, LGBTI, Jews), awareness of rights and legal frameworks (e.g., AGG), reporting behavior, and assessments of anti-discrimination measures.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses discrimination (Diskriminierung) as unequal treatment or prejudice, especially structural discrimination, including victims’ experiences, perceived prevalence, causes/mechanisms, impacts, coping and reporting, and legal or policy frameworks (e.g., Germany’s AGG). Examples include surveys or studies that measure discrimination in employment, education, housing, health, policing or services; cover targeted groups (ethnic origin, gender and gender identity, age, religion, sexual orientation, disability, Roma, migrants, Jews); and detail forms like material disadvantages, social devaluation, harassment, or physical attacks, along with awareness of rights and support channels. Multi-topic surveys that contain a dedicated discrimination module are relevant when they provide concrete items, variables or findings on discrimination, but are weakly relevant or non-relevant if the word appears only in a list of themes or metadata without substantive content. Non-relevant items use “discrimination” in unrelated senses (e.g., signal discrimination, price discrimination) or focus strictly on other policy areas without discussing unequal treatment of social groups. Edge cases such as studies of observed (not self-experienced) discrimination, antisemitism-focused surveys, or datasets that merely code discrimination variables are still relevant because they operationalize the concept; general social surveys lacking any discrimination measures are not.
50581	digitalisierung	The user seeks empirical studies and monitoring data on digitalization in Germany, covering the status quo, trends, and impacts across sectors (e.g., higher education, work, public administration, culture), along with public attitudes, opportunities/risks, and policy priorities.	A document is relevant if it treats Digitalisierung (digitalization) as a central theme—describing status, trends, policies, or impacts in Germany—such as in higher education, public administration, labor markets, or cultural institutions, ideally with empirical surveys, monitoring, or project results. Examples include reports like the Monitor Digitalisierung 360 on universities, studies on e-government services and citizen use, workplace surveys about Arbeiten 4.0, or research on libraries’ role in the digital shift. Materials remain relevant even when Digitalisierung is one module within broader surveys (e.g., Eurobarometer waves, mixed-topic polls on EU and digitalization, or projects that also cover AI/Big Data) if they contain dedicated items, findings, or datasets on digitalization. Non-relevant items only mention the term in passing (e.g., in a funding title or reference list), are duplicates without added substance, or focus on unrelated issues (such as resistant germs) unless they include a substantive digitalization section. Edge cases include metadata-only entries with no content, synonyms like digitaler Wandel or Arbeiten 4.0 that should still count as relevant, and narrowly technical “digitization” (e.g., document scanning) without societal transformation, which may be out of scope.
5065	sicherheitsempfinden	The query seeks survey datasets and findings on perceived safety (Sicherheitsempfinden), fear of crime, and victimization, including how media consumption relates to crime perceptions, the perceived severity ranking of offenses, and trust in institutions. It also covers attitudes toward security measures versus civil liberties, policy preferences, and detailed demographics and methodologies from German (and some EU/UK comparative) populations.	A document is relevant if it measures or analyzes subjective Sicherheitsempfinden (perceived safety), for example feelings of safety in one’s neighborhood after dark, on public transport, or online, and includes related constructs like crime fear, victimization experiences, media use with crime content, or the trade-off between security and freedom. Surveys or datasets that explicitly include items such as “Sicherheitsgefühl nachts in der Wohngegend,” rankings of offences by perceived severity, or CATI/CAWI studies on “innere Sicherheit” with demographic controls are strong matches. Documents are not relevant if they discuss security policy, defense, or institutional arrangements without capturing respondents’ personal feelings of safety, or if “Sicherheitsempfinden” appears only tangentially (e.g., as a buzzword without measurement). Partial or edge cases include studies that focus solely on internet security feelings (relevant if they measure perceived online safety) or broad projects where Sicherheitsempfinden is a small module embedded among many topics—these are relevant but narrower in scope. Pure crime statistics, economic “security” without subjective perception, or evaluations of CCTV/airport measures that omit any reported safety feelings would be non-relevant.
50992	digitalisierung arbeit	The user seeks data-driven insights on how digitalization is transforming work in Germany, including employee attitudes, workplace practices (e.g., home office), required skills, and impacts on employment. They want empirical studies and surveys across sectors (business, public administration, education, and civil society) to understand opportunities, risks, and policy needs in the Work 4.0 context.	A document is relevant if it links digitalization to work, employment, or workplace dynamics—e.g., studies on Homeoffice effects, workers’ skills for “Arbeiten 4.0,” impacts on labor demand (job losses/gains), changes in personnel policy and labor relations, or how specific digital tools (PCs, laptops, smartphones) shape workload, time pressure, or work-life balance. Empirical surveys of employees, firms, or sectors about digital transformation at work (such as SOEP LEE2, DiWaBe, or Kantar’s “Zukunft der Arbeit”) are strong matches, as are analyses of atypical employment where digitalization is a driver, or assessments of employers’ digital readiness. Documents mainly about digitalization in education, libraries, higher education teaching, or public e-services are not relevant unless they explicitly connect to working conditions, employment outcomes, or workplace practices (for example, how university digitization affects staff work or how e-government changes public servants’ work). Edge cases include volunteer work (Ehrenamt)—potentially relevant if treated as “work” practices in rural settings—and broad attitude surveys on “digitalization” that count only when they report labor-market or workplace-specific effects; general privacy, EU policy, or open science topics without a work nexus would be non-relevant.
51730	alkohol	The user is seeking research-based information on alcohol, especially German survey and epidemiological data about prevalence, consumption patterns, misuse, related behaviors (e.g., driving, drug use), health effects, and attitudes among adolescents and adults. This includes insights from national studies like the Epidemiologischer Suchtsurvey (ESA) and related modules on risk factors, prevention, and demographics.	A document is relevant to the query “alkohol” if it substantively covers beverage alcohol use, misuse, dependence, measurement, behaviors, contexts, or consequences (for example, prevalence rates, binge drinking, DUI, therapy, or health effects). The provided paragraph is highly relevant: it details the ESA 2018 survey and related studies, reports 30-day/12-month/lifetime alcohol prevalence, applies diagnostic criteria via the M-CIDI, and enumerates rich alcohol-specific modules (drink types, first intoxication, hospitalizations, self-help, parental drinking, driving under the influence, attitudes, risk perception, and prevention knowledge). Documents remain relevant even when alcohol appears alongside other substances, as long as alcohol receives dedicated measures, analyses, or outcomes. Non-relevant cases include texts that mention “Alkohol” only in passing, use it strictly in chemical/industrial senses (e.g., polyalcohols, solvents, disinfectants), or list it without substantive content. Edge cases include TV program references or broad health surveys where alcohol is only a token item; these are weakly relevant unless they provide concrete alcohol behaviors, harms, or attitudes.
5274	familie	The query seeks datasets and studies on families—covering household composition, marriage and fertility, parenting and childrearing, gender roles, work–family balance, caregiving, and attitudes—spanning historical records and contemporary surveys (from postwar Germany to the COVID-19 era and some international comparisons). The goal is to analyze family structures, living conditions, and their social and demographic determinants and outcomes across time and regions.	A document is relevant to the query “familie” when family is a central analytic focus—e.g., studies of family living conditions, structure and decision-making, parenting and childcare, marriage and divorce, work–family balance, kinship networks, or demographic measures like household size, family type, and Familienstand. Examples from the paragraph that are clearly relevant include surveys on Lebensverhältnisse von Familien, Vereinbarkeit von Beruf und Familie (including COVID-era changes), attitudes to Ehe und Familie, genealogical family reconstruction (Familien- und Kindertabellen), and ego-centered kin networks (KINMATRIX). Documents are less relevant if “Familie” appears only incidentally, such as TV viewing studies that merely note “watching with the family,” or if “Familie/Familienstand” appears only as a routine demographic control in research about unrelated topics. Edge cases: household-focused statistics without the word “Familie” can still be relevant if they analyze family composition or parent–child relations, while terms like “Familienname” (surname) or passing mentions in policy names don’t qualify unless the content examines family roles or outcomes. Strong signals of relevance include “Familie/Familien-” in titles, headings, or keywords and detailed variables on parenting, childcare, marriage, intergenerational support, or family finances; language, period, or country are secondary to topical focus.
5275	democracy	The user is looking for surveys and datasets on democracy in Germany that measure citizens’ attitudes toward democratic institutions, political participation, media and populism, and changes around reunification, alongside rich demographic variables. They also seek references to specific studies (e.g., Democracy Audit Mannheim, CSES) enabling national and cross-national comparisons of democratic attitudes and electoral behavior.	For the query “democracy,” documents are relevant when their primary focus is on democratic governance, institutions, rights, or citizens’ attitudes and behaviors within democracies. Examples include surveys or studies that measure satisfaction with democracy, the functioning of political systems, core freedoms (press, speech, elections), party competition and opposition, populist attitudes and their electoral implications, or initiatives like the Democracy Audit Mannheim and CSES modules. Highly relevant content also covers Germany’s democratic development and reunification-era views (e.g., democracy vs. socialism), assessments of constitutional performance, and the media’s role in sustaining or undermining democracy, as well as cross-national elite and citizen surveys on democratic norms. Documents are non-relevant if they only name “democracy” in passing, focus solely on unrelated topics (e.g., personal demography or general market-economy issues) without connecting them to democratic principles, or use “Democratic” merely as a party label. Edge cases include mixed-topic questionnaires where democracy is one of many themes (relevant if they contain substantive democracy measures), historical comparisons with dictatorship or authoritarianism (still relevant), and items where “demography” might be mistaken for “democracy” (not relevant unless linked to democratic processes).
52781	alkoholkonsum	The user seeks survey-based information on alcohol consumption, including prevalence, frequency, contexts and motives for drinking, preferred beverages, binge episodes, and comparisons to others, as well as how price or policy changes might affect use. They also want attitudes and risk perceptions (especially for youth), knowledge of alcoholism, co-use with tobacco/other drugs, health and social consequences, and demographic patterns in Germany/EU.	A document is relevant to the query “alkoholkonsum” if it discusses alcohol use patterns, attitudes, risks, measurements, or behaviors, especially when it uses the German term “Alkoholkonsum” or close synonyms. Clear signals include surveys or reports detailing drinking frequency, binge/rauschtrinken episodes, preferred beverages (beer, wine, spirits), contexts and occasions for drinking, self-assessment versus peers, youth drinking and legal age, price elasticity, DUI limits/promille, and health or social consequences, as seen throughout the paragraph. Content primarily about tobacco, illegal drugs, medication use, or gambling is only relevant if it contains substantive sections quantifying or evaluating alcohol consumption (e.g., days with 5+ drinks, motives, treatment/therapy), rather than a brief name-drop. Edge cases: materials centered on alcoholism (Alkoholiker) or therapy that reconstruct drinking histories and impacts are typically relevant; mentions of “Alkohol” in unrelated contexts (chemical solvents, mouthwash, or pure advertising policy without consumption metrics) are not. Also treat variants like Trinkverhalten, Alkoholgebrauch, Rauschtrinken, beverage-specific counts, or “last 4 weeks” drinking measures as relevant, while documents offering only interviewer ratings or standalone demographics with no linkage to alcohol use should be considered non-relevant.
52895	inequality	The user seeks survey-based evidence on inequality—particularly social and gender inequality, fairness, and intergenerational mobility—in Germany and the EU. They want to identify relevant datasets (e.g., ALLBUS, ISSP, Eurobarometer) to analyze public perceptions, attitudes, and trends over time.	A document is relevant to the query “inequality” when it substantively discusses social or economic disparities—such as definitions, measurements, attitudes, causes, or consequences—or provides datasets and survey modules focused on topics like material inequality, relative deprivation, intergenerational mobility, or gender pay gaps. For example, descriptions of ALLBUS modules on Social Inequality, ISSP “Social Inequality” waves, or Eurobarometer modules on “Fairness, inequality and intergenerational mobility,” as well as surveys covering perceptions of conflict and attitudes toward material inequality, are clearly relevant. Content is partially relevant if inequality is one of several modules in a broader instrument but includes dedicated questions, indicators, or downloadable data on inequality; it is non-relevant if “inequality” appears only in passing or as a tag with no substantive treatment. Documents centered on other themes (e.g., nuclear energy, corruption, or health) are non-relevant unless they explicitly analyze unequal outcomes within those domains (such as gender inequalities in the EU or disparities in healthcare safety). Edge cases include boilerplate repeated mentions without added substance, mathematical uses of “inequality” unrelated to social issues, or country-specific studies (Germany, EU) that remain relevant only if they engage inequality as a core analytic topic.
5335	social media nutzung	The user is seeking studies and datasets on social media usage in Germany—who uses which platforms, how often, and for what purposes—across contexts such as academia, politics/elections, digital learning, and the general public. They also want related attitudes and outcomes (privacy concerns, trust, misinformation, scholarly impact) with demographic breakdowns.	A document is relevant if it describes or measures how people use social media (Nutzung), such as frequency (e.g., daily use), platforms involved (Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp, Xing, Academia.edu), purposes and contexts (research, teaching, administration, political campaigning, learning), or types of engagement (active vs. passive). Examples include surveys of German researchers’ platform use and work-related practices, social media monitoring of election candidates’ posts and user interactions, or panel studies that report account ownership, device preferences, and usage intensity before/after GDPR. Content focused on attitudes tightly tied to usage—privacy concerns, trust in platforms, reasons for or against using online tools—is also relevant when it includes concrete measures of social media use. Non-relevant are documents about general media consumption without social networks (e.g., TV/radio only), datasets that list accounts or IDs without behavior or engagement metrics, or broad digitalization/democracy studies that lack actual social media usage data. Edge cases like digital learning studies, smartphone activity surveys, or analyses of blogs/podcasts are relevant only if they report social-media-specific behaviors or frequencies (e.g., using WhatsApp/Facebook for learning or documented follower/interaction metrics).
5377	social media use	The user seeks empirical studies and survey data on how people use social media—frequency, platforms/devices, motivations, and attitudes. They want evidence on its impacts on political information behavior, credibility/trust and disinformation, and its use in education and research, including demographic breakdowns.	A document is relevant if it describes how people or organizations use social networks, such as reporting frequency or intensity of use (e.g., daily use), platforms used (Facebook/Instagram/Twitter/YouTube/WhatsApp), purposes and contexts (news, politics, learning, research, communication), and concrete behaviors like posting, sharing, commenting, following accounts, or device preferences. Studies that measure attitudes tied to usage (credibility, trust, hate speech exposure), political information behavior on social media (e.g., encountering or seeking political content, following politicians), or institutional/producer-side practices (social media strategy, follower interactions) are also relevant. Documents are non-relevant if they discuss general media or digital tools without isolating social networks, mention social media only in passing without usage metrics or behaviors, or cover historical media use unrelated to social platforms. Edge cases include messaging apps (WhatsApp) and video platforms (YouTube) that function as social networks—these count if the document treats them as social channels with usage data; likewise, broad “Web 2.0” or “online tools” surveys are relevant only when they report specific social media use rather than just listing platforms.
53774	berufsausbildung	The user is seeking comprehensive information on vocational education and training (Berufsausbildung) in Germany—particularly the dual system—covering goals, coordination, school–industry roles, and stakeholder perspectives (teachers, trainees). They also want data and longitudinal evidence on training outcomes and transitions into work, plus historical context and statistics from the GDR education system.	A document is relevant if it substantively describes, evaluates, or measures vocational education and training, such as analyses of the dual system, deficits in company-based training and coordination, or longitudinal tracking of trainees’ transitions from apprenticeship to employment (e.g., the 1989 cohort study with waves on completion, employment status, and contract type). Also relevant are contextual overviews of the DDR system that explain Berufsausbildung mit Abitur, and administrative or survey data that report the share of employees with/without vocational training or capture detailed training trajectories (including in settings like children’s homes with “Berufsausbildung und Arbeitserziehung”). By contrast, items focused on radio listening, political attitudes, or other topics that only list “Berufsausbildung” as a demographic field are non-relevant, as are uses of “Ausbildung” referring to non-vocational contexts (e.g., premilitary training). Edge cases include datasets where vocational training is one of many variables: they are relevant if training pathways or outcomes are analyzed, but only marginally relevant if merely coded as background. Synonyms and variants such as Lehre, duale Ausbildung, apprenticeship with Abitur, or Fort-/Weiterbildung are relevant when explicitly tied to vocational training pathways and outcomes.
53827	berufsabschluss	The user seeks information on vocational/professional qualifications (Berufsabschluss) in Germany—what they are, how they are obtained and recognized, and how they are measured in educational and labor-market data. They also want to understand how such qualifications influence school-to-work transitions, career progression, and employment outcomes.	Documents are relevant if they discuss a vocational qualification (Berufsabschluss) as an outcome, requirement, or variable—e.g., highest vocational degree, completion of an apprenticeship (betriebliche oder schulische Ausbildung mit Berufsabschluss), passing an Abschlussprüfung or Facharbeiterprüfung, timing of obtaining a Berufsabschluss, or recognition of foreign vocational credentials. Highly relevant examples include survey modules asking for “höchster Berufsabschluss,” “angestrebter Berufsabschluss,” notes or results of vocational final exams, pathways like Berufsvorbereitung leading with or without Berufsabschluss, and policy pieces on recognizing foreign Berufsabschlüsse or regulated professions that require a formal vocational credential. Partially relevant are texts that mention Berufsabschluss only as metadata (e.g., parents’ Berufsabschluss) or focus mainly on school or university degrees unless they explicitly connect to Berufsausbildung; discussions of licensing/closure (Lizenzierung) are relevant if linked to the necessity or equivalence of a Berufsabschluss. Non-relevant are documents centered on political polling, values, or general schooling experiences that lack substantive treatment of vocational credentials, or those using “Abschluss” solely for general school or academic degrees without a vocational context. Edge cases: research on upskilling of unskilled workers to Fachkraft roles is relevant when it references the role of a formal Berufsabschluss (or lack thereof) in advancement, whereas mentions of “Studienabschluss” or generic “Abschluss” are not unless tied to vocational training.
5407	medien	The query seeks studies and datasets about media usage and influence, including how people use and trust different media for product decisions and political information, and the media’s role in democracy and election coverage. It also looks for evidence on the adoption of digital media and learning technologies across schools, universities, vocational training, and adult education, along with device access, usage patterns, and demographic profiles.	A document is relevant if it centers on mass media in the German sense of “Medien,” such as media use and reach, device ownership, consumption habits, credibility and trust, the role of media in politics and democracy, social media, or digital learning with media. Examples include surveys listing TV/radio/newspaper usage, SmartTV/smartphone availability, assessments of media objectivity, media–politics interactions (journalists vs. politicians), analyses of election coverage, and studies of Medienkompetenz or Soziale Medien. Materials on education that focus on digital media, learning platforms (e.g., Moodle), E-Assessment, or media literacy also qualify, especially when using German compound terms like Mediennutzung, Medienvertrauen, or Medienpädagogik. Non-relevant items include “Medien” used in other senses (biological culture media, artistic mediums, storage media, CSS media queries), the historical region “Media,” or documents where the word appears only incidentally without substantive discussion. Edge cases: organization or project names containing “Medien” are relevant only if the content substantively addresses media topics; broad political or lifestyle surveys count only when media coverage, influence, or consumption is a primary focus rather than background detail.
54621	beschäftigungsverhältnis	The user is seeking German datasets and statistics on employment relationships—employment status/type, contract terms, duration, wages, and employer characteristics. They are interested in sources like social insurance–based employment records and higher-education personnel data (HISTAT/DFG), including analyses of atypical and recall employment.	A document is relevant to “beschäftigungsverhältnis” if it defines, measures, or analyzes an employment relationship, such as contract type (temporary/permanent), employment type (full-/part-time), start/end and duration of a job, or employer characteristics. Clear examples include social-insurance employment statistics listing variables like employment type, reason for insurance change, gross daily wage, begin/end of employment, as well as higher-education staff series that tabulate academic personnel by employment relationship and funding, and studies of “recalls” or atypical work. Also relevant are datasets on social-security-exempt jobs and side jobs, or panels that explicitly ask about contract status (befristet/unbefristet), public service, Stellung im Beruf, or Beschäftigungsumfang; synonyms such as Beschäftigungsstatus or Vertragsart count. Non-relevant are materials where employment relationship is absent or merely incidental (e.g., an addiction study that only notes a respondent’s job as demographics, or education statistics focused solely on students). Edge cases include documents that mention the term only as a column label in long variable lists, or policy databases where Beschäftigungsverhältnis appears for a narrow subgroup (e.g., childcare staff), which are only marginally relevant depending on the search intent.
54808	berufsprestige	Find datasets and coding resources for occupational prestige (Berufsprestige), especially ISCO-based mapping files to prestige/status scales such as Treiman SIOPS, Wegener MPS, ISEI, and related SES measures. Identify German and European surveys (e.g., ALLBUS, ZUMA, Eurobarometer) that include these variables to enable matching prestige scores to other ISCO-coded data.	A document is relevant if it directly measures or operationalizes occupational prestige (Berufsprestige), for example by providing or applying scales such as Treiman’s SIOPS, Wegener’s Magnitude Prestige Scale (MPS), ISEI (Ganzeboom), or German variants like TBP/MBP, or by mapping ISCO-68/88 occupation codes to these prestige/status indices. Materials that include survey items asking respondents to rate the prestige of selected occupations (e.g., ZUMABUS or Eurobarometer modules) or that analyze the prestige of specific professions (e.g., doctors, stewardesses, shoemakers) also clearly qualify. Documents are typically still relevant even when Berufsprestige appears as a derived variable within broader datasets (e.g., ALLBUS files listing “Berufsprestige nach Treiman/Wegener” for each ISCO code) or when prestige scales are provided to be matched onto other data. By contrast, texts that discuss prestige in non-occupational contexts (e.g., neighborhood prestige, brand prestige) or that only treat general socio-economic status without any occupation-based prestige scale are non-relevant. Edge cases include files that mention only abbreviations (SIOPS, MPS) without the German term, or datasets that require ISCO coding to attach prestige scores—both are still relevant, whereas measures like “social distance to occupations” without a prestige metric are borderline unless explicitly tied to occupational prestige.
54995	arbeitgeber	The user seeks German datasets and surveys focused on employers—their roles, attitudes, responsibilities, and public perception. Key areas include workplace functional illiteracy, evaluations of employers (e.g., the Bundeswehr), employer responsibilities in social insurance and training, and employer-related working conditions and atypical employment.	A document is relevant to the query “arbeitgeber” when it treats employers as central actors, policies, or contexts—e.g., surveys of employers about hiring unskilled workers and support for functionally illiterate staff, analyses of employer-provided training or obligations to be informed by employees, or perceptions of an organization as an attractive employer (such as repeated modules on the Bundeswehr as an employer). Data where employers finance or deliver benefits, like social budget tables distinguishing employer contributions or “Arbeitgeberleistungen,” and business/establishment censuses that count employees at employers’ worksites in NRW, also qualify as relevant. Studies of atypical employment that assess expectations of employers, equal treatment by employers, or employer behavior toward flexible work arrangements are likewise in scope. Non-relevant are items where “Arbeitgeber” appears only incidentally (e.g., a single demographic field like “duration with current employer,” generic personal data verification, or pension details that only mention an employer once without analysis), or documents focused solely on employee traits with no employer perspective. Edge cases include multi-topic surveys where employer content is a minor submodule (marginally relevant) and texts that mention employers only as one of many possible cost-bearers without substantive discussion of employer roles.
55053	arbeit zufriedenheit	The user is looking for studies or datasets on job satisfaction and working conditions—especially among youth—including standardized satisfaction scales, shift work, workplace demands, and links to housing, leisure, and migration intentions. The context spans East German cities and sectors and includes related social and political attitudes captured in national year-in-review surveys.	Relevant documents for the query “arbeit zufriedenheit” are those that directly measure or discuss job satisfaction (Arbeitszufriedenheit), such as “Zufriedenheit mit Arbeitsbedingungen insgesamt und konkret (Skala),” “Arbeitszufriedenheit und Beschreibung der Arbeitsplatzanforderungen,” or items on satisfaction with pay, recognition, workload, autonomy, and workplace relations. Surveys that examine how specific work features affect satisfaction—e.g., shift work (Schichtsystem), work organization, performance evaluation, or collective climate—and that include explicit satisfaction scales or ratings also match. Mixed studies on living and working conditions are relevant if they contain sections like “Zufriedenheit mit der Arbeit/Arbeitsbedingungen,” “Berufszufriedenheit,” or “Zufriedenheit mit der Bezahlung.” Non-relevant are items where “Arbeit” refers to the government’s “work” (e.g., “Zufriedenheit mit der Arbeit der Bundesregierung”) or where satisfaction concerns housing, environment, or politics without any job-satisfaction component. Edge cases include records mentioning “Arbeitsmarktpolitik” or “Arbeit im Schichtsystem” without a satisfaction measure (only relevant if they link to satisfaction outcomes) and broad lifestyle surveys that become relevant only if a job-satisfaction scale is present.
55130	arbeitsbedingungen	The query seeks survey-based information on working conditions and workplace burdens—such as working hours, shift/overtime patterns, autonomy and control, performance demands, health and safety risks, job satisfaction, discrimination, and employer supports. It aims to compare these factors across industries, occupations, firm sizes, and contexts (e.g., COVID-19, platform work, academia, migrant workers) and by demographic characteristics.	A document is relevant if it directly examines Arbeitsbedingungen (working conditions) at the job, such as weekly hours, shift/night/Sunday work, overtime and pay supplements, workload and stress, autonomy and control over pace/methods, job security, exposure to hazards, discrimination or violence, training and evaluations, or overall job satisfaction. Studies focusing on specific groups or sectors—e.g., essential workers during COVID-19, academic staff (APIKS), platform workers, foreign workers in manufacturing, metalworking under technological change, or professional drivers—are clearly relevant when they report concrete measures of workplace demands and environments. Broad social surveys or business studies are only partially relevant if they contain a distinct section or scale on working conditions; for instance, research on technological change qualifies when it describes how tasks and conditions (e.g., monotony, complexity, speed set by machines/supervisors) change, but not if it only covers employment counts. Non-relevant content centers on housing, leisure, political attitudes, or firm development without specific workplace metrics, or purely demographic/interview logistics variables. Edge cases like commuting time and employer leave policies can count when framed as part of the overall work situation, and COVID-era studies are relevant only when they detail actual changes in work practices and conditions rather than general economic impact.
55226	arbeitsbelastung	The user seeks studies and datasets on work-related workload (Arbeitsbelastung) in Germany—how it is measured, its determinants (e.g., tasks, hours, shift work), and its effects on health and job satisfaction across occupations and sectors. They likely want comparable survey variables and findings spanning multiple German workforce surveys.	A document is relevant if it examines occupational workload (Arbeitsbelastung) in a concrete way—e.g., measuring perceived strain, time pressure, stress, overtime, shift/night/weekend work, high work speed, or physical/psychological demands—and links these to jobs, sectors, or worker outcomes. Clear examples include surveys of managers’ task loads and time allocation; the BIBB/BAuA Erwerbstätigenbefragung 2018 that records Arbeitsbelastungen, stress, overwork, speed and decision latitude; studies of chemie workers noting “besondere Arbeitsbelastungen”; and sectoral or demographic studies (e.g., women in agriculture, farm operators, or lifestyle/health panels) that explicitly ask about Arbeitsbelastung and its health or satisfaction effects. Documents are also relevant when workload appears as a variable alongside working hours, job satisfaction, or health (e.g., “Arbeitsbelastungen und deren Auswirkungen auf den Gesundheitszustand,” “empfundene Arbeitsbelastung” in leisure or sport modules), even if the main topic is broader. Non‑relevant items merely name the term in a long topic list without operational measures or analysis, or use “Belastung” in non‑work contexts (school sport, neighborhood noise) with no link to employment; household or parental “workload” is borderline unless tied to occupational demands. Edge cases where “Arbeitsbelastung” appears only in interviewer ratings or as a minor sub‑item are weakly relevant unless they provide data or findings on workload.
55428	arbeit	The user is seeking comprehensive German datasets and studies on work, including attitudes, job characteristics and conditions, wages and working-time statistics, and labor policies, with coverage of digitalization/home office effects (e.g., work addiction), shift work, and OSH management (ESENER), plus historical series for West/East Germany. The goal is to identify survey instruments, indices, and time series that measure these aspects over time.	A document is relevant if it primarily concerns work or employment, such as job content and conditions, wages and working time, workplace organization, worker attitudes, or labor market policies. Examples include surveys on job satisfaction or shift work, analyses of home office and workaholism, official wage and hours statistics across sectors, studies of occupational safety and psychosocial risks (e.g., ESENER), and research on “Arbeiten 4.0” and digitalization. German compounds containing the root, such as Arbeitsbedingungen, Arbeitszeit, Arbeitszufriedenheit, or Arbeitsdisziplin, are relevant when they analyze workplace factors, remuneration, or workforce behavior. A document is non-relevant if “Arbeit” appears only incidentally or in a different sense, for instance academic papers (Seminararbeit), the physics term for mechanical work, a historical slogan without labor analysis, or a personal surname. Edge cases like housework/unpaid care or general digitalization debates count as relevant only when they substantively address labor practices, worker outcomes, or employment structures rather than merely mentioning the word.
56089	arbeitsleistung	The user seeks research and survey information on work performance (Arbeitsleistung)—its determinants, motivation, evaluation, and self/supervisor assessments—across different worker groups, especially in the former GDR. They want how social, political, and workplace conditions (e.g., collective norms, training, shift work) influence performance in sectors like industry, agriculture, and transport.	A document is relevant if it analyzes, measures, or explains Arbeitsleistung (job/work performance), including self- or supervisor ratings, norm fulfillment, productivity, performance motivation, awards, absenteeism/“Fehltage,” shift work, microelectronics or rationalization at the workplace, training/Weiterbildung, and collective dynamics in DDR contexts (e.g., FDJ, SED, Jugendbrigade, MMM/Neuererbewegung) insofar as they affect performance. Studies of young workers’ motives for Leistungsstreben, readiness to switch jobs, work optimization, or plan fulfillment, as well as sectoral cases like agricultural seasonal performance or professional drivers’ safety behavior under performance pressure, are strong matches. Documents that only present demographics, housing, leisure, or general political attitudes are non-relevant unless they explicitly link those factors to work performance outcomes or evaluation (e.g., how ideology or peace attitudes relate to Planerfüllung or Leistungsbewertung). Edge cases include brief or tangential mentions of “Arbeitsleistung,” use of close synonyms (Leistungsbewertung, Produktivität, Normerfüllung, Leistungsmotivation) which still qualify, and items about academic performance (e.g., grades, Leistungsstipendium) or sports fandom, which are off-topic unless tied to workplace output.
56202	arbeitsbelastungen	The user seeks information and survey data on work-related burdens (Arbeitsbelastungen) in Germany. Specifically, they want measures of job demands, workload, time allocation and shift work, and how these relate to health and job satisfaction across different occupations and sectors.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses work-related burdens, such as perceived workload, stress, time pressure, overwork, or physical/psychological strains at the workplace, including sections or variables labeled Arbeitsbelastung/Arbeitsbelastungen. Examples include surveys of managers, agricultural workers, or industrial employees that measure workload, shift/night/weekend work, overtime, hazardous exposures, or job demands, as well as datasets that list “Arbeitsbelastung” among topics or scales. Content using clear proxies for workload (Arbeitsdruck, hohe Arbeitsgeschwindigkeit, Zeitdruck, Schichtarbeit) or instruments assessing job strain also qualifies. Non-relevant are uses of “Belastung” outside the work context (e.g., environmental load, sports training load) or documents that discuss only working time or general well-being without tying it to job demands. Edge cases include brief mentions of Arbeitsbelastung in a long topic list—these are still relevant if they indicate a measured variable, and morphological or synonymous variants (Arbeitsbelastung, Arbeitsbelastungen, Belastungen bei der Arbeit) should be treated as matches.
56749	antisemitism	Find survey-based data and analyses on the prevalence, forms, and perceptions of antisemitism—hate crime, hate speech, and discrimination—particularly across EU Member States. The user likely wants resources like the FRA 2018 survey and related Eurobarometer/German studies to examine trends since 2012, impacts on Jewish communities, and evidence to inform policy.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses antisemitism—its prevalence, forms (hate crime, hate speech, discrimination), experiences, or perceptions—and presents concrete data or analysis, such as the FRA’s 2018 survey of 16,395 Jewish respondents across 12 EU countries on harassment, safety, reporting, and behavioral impacts. It also counts as relevant when it measures attitudes or discourse about antisemitism in politics, media, or online spaces (including Israel-related antisemitism), for example survey items probing stereotypes or denial (e.g., “Jews have too much power,” “the Holocaust is a myth,” support for boycotts). Documents become non-relevant when “antisemitism” is merely a passing mention within a long list of unrelated topics (media use, economics, general politics) without specific questions, indicators, findings, or legal context tied to antisemitism. Edge cases include mixed-topic datasets like Eurobarometer or ALLBUS; these are relevant if they describe the antisemitism module’s content, measures, or results, but not if they only name the topic among many keywords. Content on legal frameworks (Holocaust denial laws, hate-speech provisions), Jewish community security, or incidents like vandalism of Jewish sites is relevant, whereas purely methodological notes without antisemitism-specific measures are not.
57292	ausländer	The query seeks studies and datasets on Germans’ attitudes and behaviors toward foreigners (Ausländer), covering contact patterns, media influence, integration and discrimination, policy preferences, and demographic predictors. It emphasizes East Germany and specific cities across different periods, including measures of xenophobia, racism, political views, and social context.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses foreigners (Ausländer) in Germany—especially attitudes, contacts, integration, rights, or conflicts—such as surveys on East Germans’ relations to foreigners, media portrayals of migrants, support for voting rights for foreigners, asylum policy, or measures of the Ausländeranteil. Examples include questionnaires about contact frequency with foreigners at work or in neighborhoods, opinions on a Zuzugsstopp, evaluations of Fremdenfeindlichkeit or Rassismus, or city studies (e.g., Duisburg, Trier) assessing German–foreigner relations. Documents are non-relevant if they focus on unrelated topics and only mention “Ausländer” in passing, or if “foreigners” refers to people outside the German context without linking to attitudes, integration, or policy in Germany. Edge cases that should still count include pieces using related terms or synonyms (Migranten, Zuwanderer, Gastarbeiter, Ausländerfeindlichkeit), or historical/foreign datasets (e.g., a Russian census) that explicitly report on “foreigners” as a category. Conversely, media or lifestyle studies are only relevant when they include explicit items about foreigners (e.g., Wahlrecht für Ausländer, Kontakt zu Ausländern); otherwise they should be excluded.
5736	wohlfahrtsstaat	The user is seeking information on the welfare state, especially its social insurance institutions, historical development in Germany and Western Europe, and survey-based evidence on public attitudes, inequality, and policy preferences. They may want datasets and analyses (e.g., ALLBUS, ISSP) that track opinions and changes over time.	A document is relevant to the query “wohlfahrtsstaat” if it substantively analyzes welfare-state institutions or policies (e.g., social insurance, health, pensions, unemployment), reports on public attitudes toward the welfare state, or presents comparative data on welfare-state spending, coverage, or financing. Clear positives include survey modules explicitly titled “Soziale Ungleichheit und Wohlfahrtsstaat” in ALLBUS (1984, 1994, 2014), the panel “Attitudes and Reported Experiences of the German Welfare State,” or historical/comparative works like Jens Alber’s analyses of social security expansion in Western Europe. Materials that only mention the welfare state in passing—such as broad political surveys where “Wohlfahrtsstaat” appears once in a long topic list or education-policy studies that note cuts “in other parts of the welfare state” without deeper treatment—are weakly relevant. Edge cases include documents using near-synonyms (social security, social insurance, expenditure ratios) that still directly pertain to welfare-state structures, and datasets where “Wohlfahrtsstaat” is one of several co-equal topics—here relevance depends on the depth and dedicated measures or tables provided.
57703	arbeitsweg	The user is seeking information on commuting to work (Arbeitsweg), including commute duration/distance, transportation modes used, and the perceived burden of the commute, as documented in surveys on housing, mobility, and employment.	A document is relevant to the query “arbeitsweg” when it explicitly addresses the commute to work, such as the duration or length of the commute, the perceived burden or stress from commuting, and the transportation modes used for the daily trip to the workplace. Mentions like “Arbeitsort und -weg,” “Belastung durch Arbeitsweg,” “Dauer/Länge des Arbeitswegs in Minuten,” “genutztes Verkehrsmittel für den täglichen Arbeitsweg,” or “maximal akzeptabler Arbeitsweg” are strong indicators of relevance, including contexts like changes in commute after moving or combining the commute with errands. Content that discusses transport use for multiple purposes (e.g., weekend recreation, shopping, and for the Arbeitsweg) is relevant if the work-commute aspect is explicitly included, but becomes less relevant if it only covers non-work trips. Pure housing, neighborhood, or leisure topics without any link to getting to work, or tangential items like “time to reach the garage” or “parking distance” without reference to the work trip, are non-relevant. Edge cases include metaphorical uses of “Arbeitsweg” (career path, not physical commute), home office situations resulting in zero commute, or unemployment panels where only the last job’s commute is described—these can still be relevant if they quantify or describe the work commute explicitly.
58154	gesundheitszustand	The user is seeking information on health status, including how it is measured and influenced by lifestyle, work, and social factors. They are interested in self-rated health, chronic conditions, functional limitations, psychosocial impacts, and healthcare utilization, particularly as captured in German population surveys of seniors, workers, patients, and families.	A document is relevant if it reports, assesses, or analyzes health status, for example via self-rated health (“Selbsteinschätzung des Gesundheitszustands”), interviewer-observed status (“sichtbarer Gesundheitszustand”), functional limitations (mobility, vision, hearing, arm function), or clinician-reported “Gesundheitszustand des Patienten.” Also relevant are surveys that tie behaviors and conditions to current, past, or expected health status, such as chronic diseases, disability, hospitalizations, medication use, work strain, smoking, alcohol, diet, and sport, as well as seniors’ or patients’ general health and well-being. Documents are non-relevant if they only address healthcare logistics or system features (waiting times, practice location, insurance details) without describing or measuring health status, or if they focus solely on life satisfaction without a health component. Edge cases include listings where “Gesundheitszustand” appears as a topic but the content provides no actual measures, or mentions of others’ health (partners, parents); these are borderline unless they include concrete assessments of health status for a defined population.
5830	politisches wissen	The query seeks surveys and datasets measuring political knowledge, including instruments that capture citizens’ knowledge, interest, attitudes, and participation alongside voting behavior and media use. It spans multiple populations and contexts (notably Germany and the U.S.) and includes methodological details and demographics for analysis.	A document is relevant if it explicitly measures, analyzes, or reports on political knowledge (politisches Wissen), such as tests or recall items about institutions, processes, parties, elections, or politicians—for example, knowing the 2005 governing coalition, identifying Spitzenkandidaten, understanding first vs. second vote, or knowledge scales among students. Studies where political knowledge is a defined variable within broader surveys (e.g., welfare-state attitudes including civics knowledge items, or online media panels that assess respondents’ political knowledge) are also relevant. By contrast, documents that only cover attitudes, trust, participation, voting behavior, or media use without any operationalization of knowledge are non-relevant, as are works about “Wissenschaftspolitik” (science policy) or research funding where “Wissen” refers to scientific knowledge rather than citizens’ knowledge about politics. Edge cases include knowledge about foreign systems (e.g., US civics) or historical regimes (Weimar, National Socialism): these are relevant if used to assess respondents’ political knowledge, but items like “ökonomisches Wissen” or “Wissen über den Nahostkonflikt” are only relevant when clearly framed as political knowledge constructs. Pure methodological notes, demographics, or coding details without knowledge content should be treated as non-relevant.
5843	populism	The user seeks comprehensive historical demographic data and analyses for Germany and selected regions (e.g., Prussia, Vienna, North Rhine-Westphalia), including age/sex structure, fertility, mortality, migration, urbanization, and labor-force statistics across long time series. The goal is to examine population dynamics and their links to legal, economic, and social changes using sources such as the Federal Statistical Office and GESIS/HISTAT.	A document is relevant to the query “populism” when it defines or analyzes populism as a political phenomenon (e.g., anti-elite rhetoric, populist leaders or parties, electoral support for AfD/Le Pen/Podemos, measurement of populist attitudes, or policy programs framed as “the people” vs. “the elite”) and provides theory, case studies, or data about it. The provided text focuses on population, not populism: it compiles demographic statistics (age structure, migration, fertility, mortality), labor-force and urbanization data, social housing trends, and historical censuses for Germany, Prussia, Vienna, and North Rhine-Westphalia. While there are occasional election-related aggregates (eligible voters, turnout, vote shares), these are not tied to populist parties, rhetoric, or attitudes, so they are at best ancillary inputs for a separate study on populist voting rather than direct evidence. An edge case is algorithmic confusion between “populism” and “population” or using these demographic series as covariates in models of populist support; without explicit linkage to populism, the match remains weak. Therefore, this document is non-relevant to “populism” despite being rich in population statistics.
58596	gesundheit arbeit	The user is seeking information and survey data on occupational health and safety and the relationship between work and health, especially management of psychosocial risks (stress, harassment, violence), musculoskeletal issues, and employee participation. They likely want datasets, methodologies, and findings from studies such as ESENER and longitudinal surveys that assess how working conditions and unemployment affect health and well-being across sectors and countries.	A document is relevant if it directly links health to work, such as discussing occupational safety and health management, psychosocial risks (work stress, harassment), risk assessments (Gefährdungsbeurteilung), workplace injuries or diseases (e.g., musculoskeletal disorders), sickness absence, or employer/employee measures to protect health at the workplace. For example, surveys of enterprises on how they manage Arbeitsschutz/Gesundheitsschutz, training of supervisors, return-to-work procedures, or analysis of health impacts of shift work and workload are highly relevant. Content that mentions “Gesundheit” only in a general or leisure context (sports, recreation, TV habits) without a workplace connection, or that discusses “Arbeit” only as employment status or job classification without health aspects, is non-relevant. Edge cases include studies on unemployment and health or work–family strain: these can be relevant if they analyze how employment conditions or job loss affect health, but less so if health is treated without a clear work linkage. Large multipurpose surveys are relevant only to the extent that their sections explicitly connect workplace conditions or policies to health outcomes.
59281	geschlechterrolle	The user is seeking information and datasets on gender roles—attitudes, norms, division of labor, and equality—and how these have changed over time. They likely want survey-based measures from German population studies (e.g., ALLBUS) and ISSP modules on family and gender roles.	A document is relevant to the query “geschlechterrolle” if it discusses norms, attitudes, or behaviors related to gender roles, such as family and gender roles modules (e.g., ISSP “Familie und Geschlechterrollen”), division of housework, women’s employment, equality, or perceptions of men’s and women’s roles in institutions like the military. Survey descriptions that explicitly list “Geschlechterrollen,” “Rollenverteilung zwischen Männern und Frauen,” or “sich verändernde Geschlechterrollen,” and include items on value orientations, tolerance, or policy attitudes tied to gender roles are highly relevant. Mentions that only list “Geschlechterrollen” among many topics (as in ALLBUS overviews) are still relevant, but weaker if they contain no detail beyond the label. Non-relevant would be texts that use “Rolle” or “Geschlecht” in unrelated senses (e.g., grammatical gender, biological sex variables without role norms) or that focus solely on survey methodology without any gender-role content. Edge cases include documents centered on “Gleichstellung” or “Rolle der Frau” that imply gender-role norms (likely relevant), and time-trend or cross-national comparisons of attitudes toward gender roles (relevant even if brief).
59288	geschlechterrollen	The user seeks survey-based information on gender roles—attitudes, norms, and their change over time—particularly in Germany. They are likely interested in datasets and findings from programs like ALLBUS and ISSP modules on family and gender roles.	A document is relevant if it directly discusses gender roles in society (Geschlechterrollen), such as attitudes toward the roles of men and women, division of housework, women’s employment, equality, or how these norms change over time. Strong examples include survey descriptions or findings (e.g., ALLBUS or ISSP modules) that measure views on family and gender roles, questions about women in the labor market or military, or cross-national/trend analyses of gender role attitudes. Content is also relevant if it provides datasets, questionnaires, or detailed indicators specifically targeting gender roles. Non-relevant material would be pieces that only mention the term in a generic topic list without substantive detail, or texts focused on other themes (e.g., security policy) unless they explicitly examine gender roles within that context (such as opinions on women soldiers). Edge cases include German synonyms and related phrases (Rollenbilder, Rolle von Mann und Frau, Gleichstellung), duplicate or metadata-only records with no discussion, and works about grammatical gender or gender identity that lack a link to social role expectations.
60378	führungsstil	The user seeks research and survey evidence on leadership styles in organizations, examining supervisors’ behaviors, values, and management concepts/training. They want how leadership relates to employee motivation, communication, and workplace climate, with perceived vs. desired goals and analyses across corporate and military contexts, controlled for organizational and demographic factors.	A document is relevant if it discusses leadership style directly—definitions, typologies (e.g., authoritarian vs. participative), measurements or scales, or evaluations of a supervisor’s or organization’s leadership approach. Examples include surveys that assess “Beurteilung des Führungsstils des unmittelbaren Vorgesetzten,” preferred own Führungsstil, leadership behavior in companies, or the Führungsstil in the Bundeswehr, as well as related factors like leadership training, written leadership principles, centralization of decisions, team work, control span, and manager–employee relations. It can also be relevant when leadership style is analyzed as a criterion in hiring or motivation, or appears in attitudes (e.g., acceptance of an authoritarian leadership style). Non-relevant would be material focused solely on wages, technical production, or consumption behavior without an explicit link to leadership style. Edge cases include synonyms such as Managementstil, Führungsverhalten, or Leitungsstil (relevant), and brief, incidental mentions without substantive content (only marginally relevant).
6086	refugee	Find datasets and surveys about refugees—primarily in Germany/Europe—that measure public attitudes, personal experiences and volunteering, perceived short- and long-term impacts, integration progress, and evaluations of government refugee/asylum policies with detailed demographics. Includes related historical data (e.g., colonial American runaway ads, GDR escapees) and studies on local social cohesion and refugee reception.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses refugees or asylum seekers—e.g., the situation of refugees in Germany or Europe, public attitudes toward them, impacts on crime or labor markets, integration progress, local reception, or evaluations of government refugee policy. Highly relevant examples include survey waves since 2016 on concerns about the influx, short- and long-term forecasts of advantages/disadvantages, Kantar’s 2021 polls on refugee policy, studies of local social cohesion that measure volunteer support and experiences with refugees, and accounts of personal engagement with refugees. Historical materials about GDR refugees or even colonial-era “refugees” identified via runaway advertisements can be relevant if the intent is broadly about people fleeing, but they are only marginally relevant if the focus is contemporary German refugee policy. Non-relevant content includes documents that merely list demographics, weights, IDs, or general political topics (e.g., digitization or climate) without substantive refugee-related measures, or texts that mention “refugee” only in passing or as metadata. Edge cases include duplicated survey waves, Berlin Cold War attitude studies, or datasets centered on traits like body height; these should be included only if they inform analyses of displacement or refugee experiences, and excluded when the query seeks current policy or integration outcomes in Germany.
60915	führungskräfte	Find empirical studies and datasets about executives/managers (Führungskräfte), mainly in Germany (with some European coverage), examining training and career development, selection and HR policies, roles and hierarchies, work practices and ICT use, compensation, leadership behavior and attitudes, public-sector reform, and related demographics.	A document is relevant if it centers on executives/managers (Führungskräfte) as subjects—covering their roles, hierarchy, selection and evaluation practices, compensation and benefits, training/continuing education, workload and time allocation, leadership styles, or attitudes (e.g., surveys of German managers on ICT use, career paths, or public-sector executive reform perceptions). Employer-side descriptions of leadership structures and pipelines, criteria for executive hiring, and programs for Führungskräfteweiterbildung also qualify, as do studies explicitly targeting leitende Angestellte or “Manager” as respondents. A document is non-relevant if it only mentions the term in passing or in a different domain, such as election studies about “strong leaders” in politics, general workplace safety surveys focused on employees rather than managers, or profiles of other professions (e.g., safety engineers) where executives are not the primary focus. Edge cases include compound terms and synonyms (Leitende Angestellte, Manager, Führungskräftenachwuchs), and pieces where executives are either the topic or the surveyed population—both can be relevant if executives are central rather than incidental. Borderline items like functional role requirement analyses or firm “Führungsstruktur” descriptions are relevant, whereas social media datasets about party leaders’ campaign messaging are not unless they explicitly address organizational executives.
6092	refugees	The user is seeking surveys and studies on refugees—primarily in Germany and Europe—that capture public attitudes, personal experiences and volunteering, evaluations of government asylum/integration policy, perceived societal impacts, and detailed demographics across multiple waves. The corpus may also include specialized datasets such as on GDR refugees and historical runaway advertisements with individual descriptors.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses refugees—e.g., public attitudes toward refugees and asylum policy, integration progress, local experiences with refugees/asylum seekers, impacts on crime or labor markets, or surveys and polls about the refugee situation in Germany or Europe. Materials that center on volunteer engagement with refugees, government performance in managing the refugee crisis, or historical analyses that explicitly describe refugees (including GDR refugees or ads describing refugees/runaways) are also relevant. Items that only mention refugees in passing, list methodological metadata (IDs, weights, dates) without refugee-focused questions, or discuss broad politics (taxes, digitization) without a clear refugee section are non-relevant. Edge cases include studies about “migrants” or “asylum seekers”: they are relevant if refugee-specific findings can be isolated; and colonial-era “runaways” or deserters are relevant only if framed as refugees fleeing and analyzed as such. For example, repeated survey waves tracking concerns about refugee influx and integration are relevant, while a dataset limited to respondents’ demographics with no refugee questions is not.
61220	führungskraft	The user is seeking research and survey data on managers/executives (Führungskräfte), covering their development and training, hierarchical roles and selection, work practices and workload, compensation and career paths, and attitudes—primarily in German industry and the European public sector.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses Führungskräfte (executives/managers) as actors—their roles, hierarchy, selection and evaluation, training and development, workloads, compensation, or attitudes—for example surveys like “Manager und Computer,” “Gehalt und Position von Führungskräften,” COCOPS on public-sector executives, or descriptions of firms’ leadership structures and Führungskräfteweiterbildung. Content that analyzes organizational requirements for leadership posts, HR policies for executive selection, or executive education (e.g., Führungskräftepolitik, Führungskräfteweiterbildung) across sectors, including public administration or industry, is clearly in scope. Partially relevant are texts where Führungskraft appears only tangentially, such as workplace safety studies that merely note “Schulung von Führungskräften” or include a demographic flag “Führungskraft mit Personalverantwortung,” or studies about safety engineers that reference expectations of company leadership without focusing on them. Non-relevant are documents using the term in a purely political-normative sense (e.g., voter surveys about preference for a “starke Führungskraft” vs. democracy) or that discuss generic “Führung” or unrelated “Kraft” without referring to managerial personnel. Edge cases include morphological and spelling variants (Führungskraft/Führungskräfte/Fuehrungskraft, compounds like Führungskräftepolitik), synonyms such as leitende Angestellte or Manager that still target the same group, and metadata-only mentions where the main text is not about executives.
61312	führung	The user is seeking survey items and data related to “Führung,” including guided tours in art exhibitions (participation, expectations, satisfaction) and leadership in political and organizational contexts (coalition/government leadership and management practices). They want to locate where and how “Führung” is measured or discussed across the listed studies.	A document is relevant to the query “führung” if it explicitly addresses leadership or a guided tour, for example political leadership formulations like “unter Führung der SPD/SED,” organizational management such as “Personalmanagement und Führung,” or museum/arts contexts like “Teilnahme an einer Führung” and “Zufriedenheit mit der Führung.” Mentions of party- or government-led coalitions (“aus SPD und CDU unter Führung der SPD”), or leadership evaluations of politicians also qualify. It is typically non-relevant if it discusses politics or culture without touching leadership or tours, or if it only matches the string inside unrelated words. Important edge cases include German compounds and variants: “Führungen” (plural), “Fuehrung” (ue spelling), and compounds like “Führungskräfte,” “Führungsstil” are relevant, while substrings in “Durchführung,” “Einführung,” or “Aufführung” are false positives. Context that clearly signals the sense (leadership vs. guided tour) strengthens relevance, whereas vague or idiomatic uses without that meaning do not.
61531	geschlecht und geschlechterrollen	The user is looking for survey data and analyses on gender and gender roles in Germany—e.g., family roles, equality, and division of labor—particularly from ALLBUS and ISSP modules. They seek sources enabling trend and comparative analyses across years (and possibly countries).	A document is relevant if it directly discusses gender and gender roles, such as attitudes toward women’s and men’s roles in family and work, division of housework, equality/egalitarianism, or women’s participation in institutions (e.g., the military or politics), and especially if it reports or analyzes data from modules like “Familie und Geschlechterrollen.” Survey descriptions that explicitly include “Geschlechterrollen” as a topic (e.g., ALLBUS or ISSP waves covering family and changing gender roles) are relevant, particularly when they detail indicators, questions, or findings on norms and role expectations. Documents that only mention “Geschlecht” as a demographic variable or list it among many controls without discussing roles or norms are not relevant, and pieces focused on other themes (religion, political participation, social capital) are non-relevant unless they contain a substantive subsection on gender roles. Edge cases include records that merely name “Geschlechterrollen” in a long topic list without any measures or results (borderline) versus those that replicate gender-role items as part of a broader survey (still relevant if the items are included). References to “gender” in a grammatical sense or to biological sex/health without social role content should be treated as non-relevant.
61686	gender role attitudes	The user is seeking survey-based information on public attitudes toward gender roles and gender equality, including views on women’s roles (e.g., in the military), division of household and childcare labor, and changing gender norms. They likely want comparative or longitudinal data, especially from German and European studies such as ALLBUS/ISSP and recent EU voter surveys.	A document is relevant if it explicitly measures or analyzes beliefs about gender roles—e.g., scales of “gender role orientation,” opinions on the division of household and childcare tasks, support for women’s employment or breadwinner–homemaker norms, or attitudes toward women in the armed forces. Broad social surveys that include modules like “Family and Changing Gender Roles” (ALLBUS/ISSP) or a specific question on gender roles (EES 2024) are relevant even if gender roles are only one subsection. Data on time use or household task distribution can be relevant when linked to attitudinal items (preferences, fairness judgments), but purely behavioral logs without any opinion measures are borderline or non-relevant. Documents that only list “gender” as a demographic, or focus on political/security issues without questions about gender-role beliefs, are non-relevant. Mentions of “gender equality” or “gender roles” are relevant only if they capture respondents’ evaluations or approval (e.g., acceptance of women soldiers); institutional descriptions or policy overviews without public attitudes are not.
61734	gender role	The user wants sources and measures on gender roles and gender role orientation—covering division of household labor, childcare, time use, partnership and employment histories, and attitudes toward gender equality. They are specifically looking for survey datasets and modules (e.g., ALLBUS/GGSS and ISSP Family and Changing Gender Roles) to analyze these topics, primarily in Germany and in cross-national comparisons.	A document is relevant to the query “gender role” if it examines gender role orientation, attitudes toward gender roles, or the division of labor in family and work, such as surveys on “family and changing gender roles,” “distribution of household tasks,” “time use,” “childcare,” or attitudes toward women in the armed forces. Descriptions of datasets or modules explicitly titled “Gender role orientation,” “Gender roles,” or “Family and Changing Gender Roles (ISSP/ALLBUS)” are strong matches, even if embedded in broader survey overviews. By contrast, content focused solely on security policy, NATO, electoral behavior, or the “role” of politicians or institutions without a gender dimension is non-relevant. Edge cases include documents that mention “gender” only as a demographic variable (not relevant), or use “role” in unrelated contexts (“role of NATO”), versus pieces that link partnership quality or employment biographies to gendered norms in household work (relevant).
61761	gender roles	The user seeks survey-based data on gender roles, including division of household work and childcare, employment and partnership histories, and attitudes toward gender equality. They likely want sources such as ALLBUS/GGSS and ISSP “Family and Changing Gender Roles” modules for trend and cross-national analysis.	A document is relevant if it directly addresses gender roles—such as attitudes toward gender roles, gender role orientation, changing gender roles in families, division of household labor and childcare by gender, or evaluations of women’s roles in institutions (e.g., women in the armed forces). Clear signals include modules titled Family and Changing Gender Roles, measures of gender role orientation and self-perception, and survey content on time use, distribution of household tasks, partner history, and childcare analyzed through a gender lens. Documents are non-relevant when “role” refers to institutions or politicians (e.g., role of NATO, role of the opposition) or when “gender” appears only as a demographic control in studies focused on security, elections, or general politics. Mixed-topic surveys are relevant if a distinct module or item set explicitly covers gender roles, even if other modules focus on unrelated issues; items like quality of partnership or employment biography are only relevant if tied to gendered expectations or comparisons. Edge cases include broad “gender equality” mentions without role-specific measures, which may be weakly relevant unless they include explicit attitudes or behaviors about expected roles.
6177	erziehung	The user is seeking information on “Erziehung” (child-rearing/educational upbringing) in German social surveys, including parental practices, values, and styles, political and religious education, and how these relate to family background, schooling, work, and child outcomes. They likely want datasets or study summaries containing variables on upbringing within broader demographic and socio-economic contexts.	A document is relevant to the query “erziehung” when it explicitly addresses upbringing or child-rearing, such as parenting styles and discipline, religious or political socialization, or family roles in children’s development—for example, surveys on Erziehungsziele and Erziehungsstil, parental involvement in kindergarten, or media influences on children. Content that treats Erziehung within institutions also qualifies if the focus is socialization or pedagogy, like school-based political education, religious education, or policies affecting child-rearing (e.g., Erziehungsgeld) coupled with parental practices. It is less relevant when “Erziehung” appears only as a peripheral variable in broad topic lists (e.g., general life-course or economic surveys) or when the main emphasis is on unrelated domains such as employment history, income, or interview logistics. Edge cases include education-focused materials (Schul- und Berufsbildung) that lack discussion of values or socialization—only partially relevant—and studies of physical development or sports that merely note grades in Körpererziehung without analyzing pedagogical or parenting aspects.
6213	religionszugehörigkeit	The user seeks historical, regionally detailed statistics on religious affiliation in Germany—especially West Germany and North Rhine-Westphalia—drawn from population censuses. They want denominational distributions by state/region across time (circa 1871–2011) to analyze trends such as secularization and post-reunification shifts.	A document is relevant if it reports or analyzes religious affiliation (Religionszugehörigkeit) as legal membership categories, ideally with numeric distributions over time and/or by geography. Highly relevant examples include census-based tables for West Germany or NRW from 1871–2011 showing absolute or percentage shares of Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, and other/none, broken down by Bundesland, Regierungsbezirk, Kreis, or cities like West Berlin, and noting harmonized versus census-specific classifications. Partially relevant are broader demographic or election datasets that include Religionszugehörigkeit as one variable among many, or proxies such as church membership/church tax counts, especially when they discuss territorial changes or classification shifts across censuses. Non-relevant are texts that discuss religion in general (beliefs, religiosity, religious practice, religious education) without affiliation categories or distributions, or items where “Zugehörigkeit” refers to non-religious groups; coverage limited to unrelated regions/timeframes may also be off-topic. Edge cases include 2011 census non-response for minority religions, spelling/term variants (Religionszugehoerigkeit, Konfession), and documents clarifying that official data measure legal membership rather than personal belief—these still support relevance.
62289	generation y	The user seeks a definition of Generation Y (Millennials), including the birth-year range that defines the cohort and their typical characteristics, values, and behaviors, possibly contrasted with other generations.	A document is relevant to the query “generation y” when it explicitly discusses the cohort also known as Millennials (typically born 1981–1996), uses synonyms like “Gen Y,” or analyzes their attitudes, behaviors, demographics, or outcomes (for example, Millennials’ political preferences in the 2009 EU elections or workplace expectations). It can also be relevant if it defines the cohort by birth years and segments results accordingly, such as “voters born after 1980 showed higher support for X.” By contrast, content that merely uses the letter “y” in unrelated ways (e.g., “y axis” on a political spectrum) or describes a survey and its policy statements without any age or generational framing is non-relevant, even if it includes general demographics. Edge cases include documents that provide raw age or birth-year fields enabling a clear mapping to Generation Y; these become relevant only if the cohort is actually segmented or discussed. Mentions of “young people” are relevant only when tied explicitly to the Millennial birth range rather than generic youth.
62491	generation	The user is looking for datasets and studies that operationalize “generation” (e.g., school cohorts, voter generations, Generation Z) and analyze cohort-specific patterns in education, political behavior, mobility, and attitudes. The focus is largely on Germany/Prussia from the 19th century to the present, including how “school generations” influenced Reichstag voting.	A document is relevant if “generation” is a central analytic unit, especially in the sense of age cohorts, named cohorts (e.g., Generation Z), or inter-/intragenerational dynamics. Clear signals include defining cohort boundaries (by birth years or schooling periods), comparing outcomes across cohorts (for instance, Prussian “school generations” and voter behavior 1816–1927 or youth generations 1919–1933), or coding results by “generation groups.” Methods sections or datasets that segment variables by intergenerational or intragenerational mobility, or tables explicitly labeled “generation” or “generational” are also relevant. Non-relevant material uses “generation” in unrelated senses (electricity or text/content generation), as marketing boilerplate (“next-generation”), or only incidentally (e.g., “generated variables”) without cohort-based analysis. Edge cases to include are hyphenated and variant forms (multi-generational, Gen Z) and synonyms like cohort, while near-string matches such as “General” or country names should not be treated as hits.
6267	abtreibung	The query seeks information on abortion—particularly public attitudes, policy preferences, and related factors like religion, politics, contraception, and demographics—across multiple social surveys and datasets. It aims to identify where abortion is measured within broader studies (e.g., church and youth work, family planning, electoral behavior, EU issues) and what variables or questions are included.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses abortion (Abtreibung), including legal frameworks (e.g., §218 StGB), moral or religious debates, access and policy, or measured attitudes and behaviors, and it may use synonyms like Schwangerschaftsabbruch. Examples of relevance include survey modules asking about permissibility under conditions (rape, health risk to the mother, fetal impairment, social/economic reasons), church modernization debates that mention a more liberal stance on abortion, youth or family planning studies linking abortion with contraception, and political content such as referenda or EU policy discussions that reference abortion laws. Materials on reproductive health that explicitly include abortion alongside pregnancy, contraception, or adolescents’ knowledge and attitudes also qualify. Non-relevant cases include texts where “abtreibung” appears only incidentally in metadata, or documents focused solely on miscarriage/stillbirth (Fehlgeburt, Totgeburt) or veterinary/animal “abortion” rather than human pregnancy termination. Edge cases: a brief mention of abortion as one item in a long list is only weakly relevant, whereas documents using the synonym Schwangerschaftsabbruch or rating scales of abortion acceptance are relevant even without extensive discussion.
6322	klima	The user wants surveys and datasets related to “klima” (climate), spanning environmental climate change and climate protection as well as measures of social, political, and organizational climate. The focus is on German and EU contexts, including youth and general population attitudes, school/workplace climate, and broader public opinion.	A document is clearly relevant to the query “klima” if it addresses environmental climate topics or climate change, such as surveys on “Klima und Umwelt,” youth attitudes toward climate protection, or historical time series on “Umwelt, Klima und Natur” (e.g., the Hamburg BUS survey, the youth climate study, or Deutschland in Daten). It is also relevant when “Klima” appears in compounds like Klimaschutz, Klimawandel, or Klima- und Umweltpolitik. Partially relevant or ambiguous are metaphorical uses like “soziales Klima,” “Unterrichtsklima,” “Arbeitsklima,” or “politisches Klima” (e.g., teacher surveys on collegial climate or Eurobarometer modules on social climate), which match the keyword but may not satisfy an environmental-climate intent. Non-relevant are documents that do not mention “Klima” at all or only use unrelated senses (e.g., “Klimaanlage” for air conditioning or idioms like “ein Klima der Geborgenheit”) without any environmental context. Edge cases include case-insensitive matches, hyphenation, and German compounding, so hits like “Schutz von Umwelt und Klima” should be counted, whereas items focused solely on school cooperation or voter behavior without a climate facet should not.
63419	islam	The user is seeking empirical datasets and studies on Islam/Muslims in Germany that estimate population size and composition and detail demographics, religious practice, integration, and schooling. They also want surveys of broader public attitudes toward Islam and related political issues in Germany and Europe, accounting for census limitations and methodological notes.	A document is relevant to the query “islam” if it directly addresses Islam or Muslims—for example, estimating the number of Muslims in Germany, describing Islamic beliefs and practices, or analyzing integration, headscarf use, Islamic education, or recognition of Islamic associations (e.g., DITIB, ZMD, VIKZ). Surveys that measure public attitudes toward Islam—such as “Islam belongs to Germany,” monitoring Islamic communities, compatibility of Islam and democracy, or perceptions of “Islamic fundamentalism”—are also relevant, even when framed as security or foreign-policy items. By contrast, texts focused solely on Christian church membership trends or generic religion without Islam-specific data, or datasets where Muslims are only tangentially mentioned (e.g., in a long list of religions) or omitted due to non-response with no imputation, are non-relevant. Edge cases include documents where “Islam” appears only as an example, where affiliation reflects legal membership rather than belief, or where Alevis are included/excluded ambiguously; these are weakly relevant unless they analyze Muslims or Islam-specific outcomes. Technical details about sampling, geocoding, or weighting are not relevant unless they specifically enable Islam-focused estimates or subnational analysis of Muslims.
6370	klimawandel	The user is looking for surveys and datasets on public opinions about climate change and climate policy in Germany and the EU, including views on mitigation measures, renewables vs. nuclear, oil and gas supply, and the energy transition. They also seek methodological and demographic details from sources such as GIP, Eurobarometer, and ISSP.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses climate change (Klimawandel) itself—its causes, impacts, or responses—such as public attitudes toward climate policy, CO2 emissions, renewable energy, nuclear power, adaptation, extreme weather, or willingness to pay for climate protection. Survey descriptions and questionnaires that include dedicated “Klimawandel” modules, questions on EU or national measures, personal behaviors (e.g., flying, energy saving), or policy instruments (CO2 tax, tempolimits, subsidies) are clearly relevant. Materials that only list climate change as one of many topics without further detail, or that discuss adjacent issues (EU elections, poverty, or general environment) without explicit linkage to climate change, are weakly or non-relevant. Edge cases include energy-security discussions or “Energiewende” content that are relevant only if tied to emissions and climate goals, and documents where “Klimawandel” appears merely as a keyword tag or passing mention, which should be treated as low relevance. Synonymous or related terms in German or English (e.g., Klimaschutz, globale Erwärmung, greenhouse gases) also signal relevance when they directly concern climate change.
6481	home office	The user is looking for survey data on home office/remote work in Germany, including whether and how often people work from home, shifts to home office during COVID-19, and reasons or barriers. They also want attitudes toward legal regulation or a right to home office, along with related demographics.	A document is relevant to the query “home office” when it discusses working from home as a form of paid employment, including measurement of workplace location (e.g., “at home in the home office”), remote/telework or hybrid arrangements, changes in work patterns during COVID (“more home office”), or attitudes toward policies such as a legal regulation on home office and reasons for wanting or rejecting it. It remains relevant if home office is only one module among many topics, as long as it contains concrete items or results about prevalence, interest, or regulation of working from home. By contrast, texts about “old people’s homes,” nursing homes, or housing, and mentions of “offices” as public authorities (Press and Information Office, employment office, social services office) are non-relevant because they do not concern remote work. Edge cases include “work at home” referring to unpaid housework or historical piecework; count it only if it clearly means paid job tasks done from home, and ignore uses of “Home Office” as the UK ministry unless the document is specifically about that institution. Strong relevance signals include variables on current place of work, shifts to home office during the pandemic, and questions about legal regulation or personal interest in home office.
6499	politische bildung	The user is seeking surveys and datasets on political education and civic engagement, including political interest, media use and preferred information sources, knowledge and trust in institutions, participation, and related attitudes, with demographic breakdowns. The focus is primarily on Germany (e.g., Saxony) and includes references to institutions and studies such as the Bundes-/Landeszentrale für politische Bildung, the German Internet Panel, and media literacy research.	A document is relevant if it explicitly treats politische Bildung (civic/political education) as its focus, for example by surveying interest in political learning, preferred and used sources for political education, trust in and use of institutions that provide it (e.g., Bundes- oder Landeszentralen für politische Bildung, political foundations like Konrad Adenauer or Friedrich Ebert, parties, Volkshochschulen, universities), participation in educational events, or the likelihood of seeking offerings. Studies on media literacy and journalism use are also relevant when framed as civic education (e.g., Sächsische Landeszentrale studies on media competence, continuing education needs, and support for media pedagogy). Non-relevant are datasets centered on elections, party preference, EU or security policy, or general socio-economic attitudes without an explicit link to political education programs, institutions, curricula, or learning outcomes (even if they mention political interest or demographics). Edge cases include documents about “Bildung” or media use: they count only if they connect to civic/political learning goals, methods, or providers; pure campaign polling, generic political attitudes, or international cases without a civic-education component should be excluded. Evaluations or positions on state support for civic education in schools and society, and assessments of how such institutions contribute to democracy, are strongly relevant.
6501	homosexualität	The user seeks survey-based information on homosexuality, including public attitudes and value judgments, sexual orientation and behavior, coming out, contacts, discrimination and violence, and related issues like AIDS, family, religion, and policy. The focus is largely on German and European populations across various datasets and time periods.	A document is relevant if it substantively discusses homosexuality as identity, behavior, attitudes, or policy—e.g., surveys measuring “Einstellung zur Homosexualität,” studies of coming out, same-sex relationships, discrimination, or contact with gay/lesbian people, or modules linking homosexuality to health topics like HIV/AIDS. Materials that analyze acceptance of homosexuality within broader value indices (World/European Values, Eurobarometer), or that focus on specific contexts such as students, the military, youth socialization, or evaluations of films about homosexuality are also relevant. Documents that only list the word “Homosexualität” in passing, treat it as a minor checkbox among many unrelated items without any findings or description, or that discuss unrelated concepts (e.g., homophones/technical terms) are non-relevant. Edge cases include broad social surveys where homosexuality is one of several attitude scales (still relevant if the variable is present and described) and datasets aggregating acceptance as a subcomponent (relevant if the role of the component is clear).
6534	kriminalitätsfurcht	The user seeks German survey data and documentation on fear of crime, including measures of perceived safety, victimization across offense types (e.g., theft, assault, burglary, cybercrime), reporting behavior, and protective actions. They also want how these metrics relate to demographics and political attitudes/voting, with details on methodology, regional coverage, and longitudinal comparisons.	A document is relevant to the query “kriminalitätsfurcht” if it measures or analyzes fear of crime or perceived safety, for example via survey items on Sicherheitsgefühl in the neighborhood at night, Beunruhigung about being assaulted or burglarized, delikt­spezifische Kriminalitätsfurcht (theft, assault, burglary, cybercrime), expected victimization probabilities, and avoidance or protective behaviors taken due to fear. Studies and datasets that explicitly include a Kriminalitätsfurcht module or closely related constructs such as Sicherheitsempfinden, Beunruhigung, incivilities/disorder, and fear of terrorism or online crime (phishing, identity theft, malware) are clearly relevant; examples include the Deutscher Viktimisierungssurvey and “Sicherheit und Kriminalität in Sachsen 2022,” as well as election or opinion polls that ask about one’s own Kriminalitätsfurcht. Documents are non‑relevant when they focus solely on crime control policy (Kriminalitätsbekämpfung), party preferences, general demographics, or raw victimization counts without assessing fear, or when Kriminalitätsfurcht is only name‑checked without corresponding questions or measures. Edge cases that should still count include sections using synonyms like Sicherheitsempfinden or items such as “Sicherheitsgefühl nachts in der Wohngegend” even if the exact term Kriminalitätsfurcht is absent, and modules on fear tied to specific settings (public transport, workplace) or to internet security. Conversely, election studies that mention crime only as a policy competence area, or datasets where Kriminalitätsfurcht appears in a keyword list but no related variables are present, should be treated as non‑relevant or borderline.
65758	hochschule	The user is seeking comprehensive information and datasets on German higher education institutions, including surveys and time-series statistics on students, staff, governance, equality structures, digital learning, knowledge transfer, admissions, grading trends, and employer perceptions. They likely want sources such as HISTAT and DFG data handbooks that compile historical and contemporary data on universities and vocational schools across regions and time periods (including the former DDR).	A document is relevant if it clearly concerns higher education institutions (Hochschulen) and related topics such as universities/Fachhochschulen, professors and students, governance, equality offices, digital teaching, admissions/selection, grading, or statistical time series about Hochschulen (e.g., HISTAT datasets on staff, funding, or student numbers). Concrete examples include surveys of Hochschullehrer on knowledge transfer, monitors of digital learning at the Hochschule, studies on grade inflation in university exams, or datasets distinguishing Universitäten, Technische Hochschulen, and Fachhochschulen. Material that only covers non-tertiary schooling (e.g., Berufsschulen) without a higher-education angle, or uses “Hochschule” merely in a name without substantive discussion of higher education, is non-relevant. Edge cases include DDR data that explicitly treat the Hochschulwesen (relevant), mixed documents that cover both Berufliche Schulen and Hochschulen (partly relevant if the higher-ed component is substantive), and content using synonyms/compounds like Universität, Uni, FH, Hochschulpolitik, or Hochschulzugang (relevant even without the exact keyword). Conversely, strings containing “hoch” or “schule” in unrelated compounds or geographic names, or generic tech/equipment mentions not tied to a Hochschule context, should be treated as non-relevant.
6616	politische partizipation	The query seeks survey datasets and studies on political participation, interest, and civic engagement—primarily in Germany—including ALLBUS/ISSP modules, SOEP-based analyses, and local urban renewal case studies, with rich measures (protest, political culture, media use, social capital) and demographics. The goal is to analyze determinants, patterns, and trends in participation across different populations and contexts.	A document is relevant if it directly treats political participation (politische Partizipation) as behavior, attitudes, or measures—such as voting, protest/demonstrations, civic/petition activity, membership, political interest, efficacy, and engagement scales—and examines determinants or contexts of these activities. Survey-based descriptions and study reports are highly relevant when they include participation modules or indices (e.g., ALLBUS/ISSP items on conventional and unconventional participation, political alienation, media use, political knowledge, trust) or analyze participation in local contexts like urban renewal cases in Cologne/Oberhausen/Wuppertal or Andernach. Content on political education is also in scope if it links information sources, event attendance, or readiness to participate to political engagement; youth studies discussing protest participation, left–right self-placement, party ID, and participation indices likewise qualify. Non-relevant material includes texts that only list demographics without analyzing participation, or that use “Partizipation” in non-political domains (workplace, school) unless explicitly tied to political involvement; generic program overviews that mention participation but provide no measures or findings are borderline. Edge cases include cross-national gender-representation surveys that measure political participation (relevant) and documents where “participation” appears in long topic lists—these should be included only if they contain concrete indicators or analyses of political participation.
66195	environmental	The user is seeking comprehensive survey data on environmental awareness and behavior—primarily in Germany—including attitudes toward environmental protection, consumption and mobility habits, climate and energy policy preferences, and consumer protection. They also want methodological details, demographic variables, time‑series context, and coverage of recent waves such as the 2024 study.	For the query “environmental,” a document is relevant when it substantively addresses environmental awareness, conditions, policy, or behavior—such as surveys on attitudes to pollution and climate change, measures of conduct harmful to the environment, perceived noise and air/water pollution, willingness to pay for eco-friendly products, waste separation, eco labels, and energy or mobility transitions (e.g., the Energiewende). The paragraph is highly relevant because it details repeated German survey programs on environmental consciousness, including scales on attitudes and behaviors, assessments of environmental quality at local, national, and global levels, readiness to change lifestyles, and policy preferences on taxes, traffic, agriculture, and climate. Content that is only tangential—consumer protection or political participation without an environmental link, demographic fields, or survey logistics—is peripheral and not directly responsive unless tied back to environmental outcomes. Edge cases include documents using “environmental” in unrelated senses (e.g., business or software environments) or only name-dropping the term; these would be non-relevant, whereas historical or regional angles (e.g., GDR comparisons, EU agricultural policy) remain relevant if they analyze environmental protection or impacts. Similarly, sections on vocational training or MMM tasks are non-relevant unless they explicitly connect to environmental attitudes or behaviors.
6719	welfare	The user seeks empirical data and studies on welfare in Germany, including profiles of recipients, evaluations of youth welfare institutions, and public attitudes toward the welfare state and social justice. They also want analyses of conflicts among welfare workers and longitudinal social indicators tracking welfare and quality of life (1950–2013).	A document is relevant if it addresses public welfare/social assistance systems, their recipients, administration, and outcomes—for example, profiles of aid recipients (age, marital status, nationality), reasons for granting aid, duration and amount of benefits, or the role and evaluation of Youth Welfare Committees and departments. Materials that measure welfare broadly—such as social indicator systems tracking life satisfaction, income, health, social isolation, or other quality-of-life metrics over time—also count as relevant. Studies of organizations serving welfare clients (e.g., Caritas) that detail clients’ income, housing, unemployment benefits, support payments, experiences with authorities, and pathways into or out of welfare are clearly on-topic. Edge cases include texts on “welfare workers” and workplace conflict: these are only marginally relevant unless they explicitly link to public welfare service delivery; theoretical “welfare economics” or “well-being” pieces are relevant if they operationalize or assess social welfare, but not if they use the term loosely. Non-relevant documents would use “welfare” in unrelated senses (animal welfare, corporate employee welfare, police welfare checks) or discuss general socioeconomics without any substantive tie to welfare policy, benefits, or welfare-state institutions.
67543	flüchtling	The user is looking for survey-based information and datasets on refugees in Germany and the EU, including public attitudes toward asylum policy, perceived impacts of refugee inflows, integration, and local experiences. They also seek insights on volunteer engagement, expectations of government, related political opinions, and demographic breakdowns.	A document is relevant if it explicitly discusses refugees/asylum seekers or refugee policy, including compound and plural forms such as “Flüchtlinge,” “Flüchtlingspolitik,” “Flüchtlingshilfe,” or related terms like “Asyl,” and covers themes like German/EU asylum policy, the impacts of refugee inflows, and personal engagement with refugees. Strong signals include content on neighborhood experiences with refugees, perceived effects (crime, meeting skilled labor demand, cultural enrichment, demographic change, financial strain), expectations of return, and concrete volunteering actions (donations, hosting, language tutoring, supporting shelters). Political or social-cohesion materials are relevant when they link elections, party preferences, or community cohesion directly to refugee topics (e.g., views on Merkel’s refugee policy, EU reform, acceptance of local refugee housing); similar content without a refugee component is non-relevant. Broad migration/diversity or integration discussions are only relevant if refugees/Asylbewerber are explicitly addressed rather than immigration in general. Edge cases include historical DDR refugees (still relevant), and datasets where “Flüchtling” appears only in variable lists or passing mentions—these are weakly relevant unless the substantive focus centers on refugees.
6763	psychotherapie	Seeks survey-based information on psychotherapy among Freiburg physicians, focusing on doctors’ attitudes toward psychotherapy and related treatment patterns within the broader context of their professional characteristics, patient mix, and continuing education.	A document is relevant if it explicitly discusses psychotherapy—its use, attitudes toward it, training, policies, or how physicians engage with it—such as a survey that measures doctors’ “attitude to psychotherapy” or their participation in psychotherapy-related continuing education. Content about mental health treatment modalities, referrals to psychotherapists, or the prevalence of psychological illnesses connected to therapeutic approaches also counts. It is not relevant if it only covers doctors’ economic conditions, administrative workload, demographics, or medication prescribing without addressing psychotherapy itself, and terms like psychology or psychosomatic issues alone do not guarantee relevance. Edge cases include long lists where “psychotherapy” appears as one item (still relevant but shallow), language or morphological variants (Psychotherapie, psychotherapeutisch, Psychotherapeut), and potential false positives like physiotherapy or psychopharmacology mentions that lack a psychotherapeutic component. For example, this survey text is relevant because it directly includes “attitude to psychotherapy,” even though many other topics are listed.
67689	family	The user seeks survey-based datasets and analyses on family structures and dynamics—including multigenerational living, caregiving and financial support, custody models, celebrations, and intergenerational ties—and their links to health care use, employment and gender roles, and policy. They want methodological details and demographic coverage across countries and time.	A document is relevant if it examines “family” as a social unit—structures, relationships, roles, support and care, custody arrangements, intergenerational ties, or family-related policies and wellbeing. Examples include surveys on post-separation family models and joint custody, household composition and caregiving, attitudes to marriage and childrearing, kinship networks (e.g., KINMATRIX), and studies linking family circumstances to outcomes (such as childcare, financial support, or media use). Partially relevant items treat “family” as a significant subtheme in other domains—healthcare (family doctor, relatives in need of care), economics (family businesses, remittances), or education—when they analyze impacts on or practices within families rather than merely naming them. Non-relevant material uses “family” only as a label detached from human kinship (e.g., product families, mathematical families) or contains only incidental mentions with no substantive discussion. Edge cases: historical genealogy tables are relevant if they map relationships across generations; a study on internet use is relevant when it explicitly ties trajectories to family context but not if it reports usage trends without familial factors.
6854	natur	The user is seeking surveys and studies about “nature,” specifically German public attitudes and behaviors regarding nature and biodiversity, conservation, nature-friendly consumption, urban and agricultural landscapes, and landscape changes from the energy transition, including measurement scales, motivations, and demographic correlates.	A document is relevant if it addresses “Natur” in the environmental or ecological sense—e.g., attitudes toward nature, nature experience, biodiversity, conservation (Naturschutz), urban nature (Stadtnatur), protected areas (Nationalparks, Natura 2000), agriculture’s impacts on nature, or landscape changes from the energy transition. German compound terms containing “Natur” such as Naturerleben, Naturschutz, Naturverträglichkeit, Naturpark, or biologische Vielfalt count as strong signals, as do survey instruments measuring responsibility for nature, frequency of time spent in nature (forest, parks, rivers), or willingness to engage in conservation. Content about nature-friendly consumption (Bio, regional/seasonal products, Naturkosmetik when tied to environmental impact) and policy/evaluation items (wildness areas, species protection, land-use, Gentechnik in agriculture) are also in scope. Non-relevant are uses where “natur” appears only tangentially or idiomatically (e.g., “the nature of a problem,” media lists that merely mention “Natur- und Tierfilme,” or topics like TV ratings, general religion, or politics without a substantive link to environmental nature). Edge cases include “Naturwissenschaft(en)” or “menschliche Natur”: these are only relevant if explicitly connected to environmental preservation or human–nature relations rather than science education or philosophical discussion.
718	turkey	The user seeks research and survey data related to Turkey, especially on Turkish migration and integration in Europe (notably Germany), identity, language, and discrimination. They also want public opinion datasets on Turkey’s potential EU membership and broader foreign policy perceptions involving Turkey.	A document is relevant to the query “turkey” when it centers on the country Turkey or Turkish people, for example studies of Turks in Europe, surveys on migration to and from Turkey, or public opinion about Turkey’s potential EU membership, NATO, or foreign policy. Content about Turkish identity, language use, religion, discrimination, remittances, and attachment to Turkey, as well as references to Turkish cities (Ankara, Istanbul), demonyms (Turkish, Turk), or the country code TR that clearly indicate the state, also qualifies. Broad comparative surveys that devote specific questions or sections to Turkey (e.g., attitudes toward Turkish EU accession or views of Turkey among Europeans) are relevant, while lists that merely name Turkey among many countries without substantive discussion are only weakly relevant. Documents about “turkey” the bird, recipes, Thanksgiving, or a person/company named Turkey are non-relevant. Variants like Türkiye or references to Turkish parties, elections, or diaspora communities support relevance when they clearly pertain to the country.
729	trust	The user seeks surveys and datasets that measure public trust—toward governments, institutions, media, international organizations, and major powers—across countries and time. They want data connecting trust to issues like security/defense, EU integration, and GDPR/data privacy, with accompanying demographics for analysis.	A document is relevant if it explicitly measures or discusses trust as an attitude, such as trust in institutions, political leaders, fellow citizens, media, or supranational bodies (e.g., “trust in NATO/OSCE/EU/UN,” “trust in the EU and its institutions,” “most/least trusted institution,” “general personal trust,” or “trust in data protection by Google/Facebook”). Mentions of mistrust/distrust, trust scales, trends or changes in trust over time, and reasons for trust judgments also count as relevant, including closely related phrasing like “confidence in the new leadership” when it clearly denotes trust in actors or policies. A document can still be relevant even if trust is one of many survey topics (e.g., security policy, EU enlargement, elections) as long as it contains explicit items gauging trust levels or evaluations. Non-relevant items are those that discuss wars, policy, or demographics without any trust measures, that use “confidence” in a statistical or unrelated sense, or that use “trust” only as a legal/financial term. Edge cases include topic lists where “trust” appears only as a passing keyword or as “confidence-building measures” without measurement; these should be deemed relevant only if they include explicit trust constructs like scales, most/least trusted rankings, or trust in problem-solving ability.
7422	psychische	The query seeks survey datasets and questionnaires focused on psychological well-being and mental health indicators across diverse populations (e.g., children, adults, elderly), including attitudes, impairments, help-seeking, and prevalence. It also looks for associated modules on household telecommunications, internet access and child online safety, animal welfare attitudes, substance use, and detailed demographics and methodology.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses psychological or mental health content, especially survey-based measures of mental well-being or parents’ reports on children’s mental state. Clear signals include mood and affect scales (e.g., anxious, depressed, exhausted, happy), limitations in social or daily activities due to emotional problems, use of professional help or psychotherapy/psychotropic medications, diagnoses, and attitudes toward people with mental health issues. Examples of relevance are Eurobarometer modules on public health/psychological well-being, parent surveys about children’s emotional states, or datasets in which “psychische Auffälligkeit” is measured alongside outcomes. Documents focused on telecommunications, internet access, or animal welfare are non-relevant unless they tie those topics to psychological outcomes (e.g., the emotional impact of online harms on children or parental coping guidance). Edge cases: studies that merely note participants are “psychically healthy” as an inclusion criterion, or that list “psychische Belastbarkeit” without operational mental health measures, are typically non-relevant; addiction or homelessness datasets become relevant if they contain explicit measures of mental disorders or psychological functioning.
7445	psychische erkrankungen	Find German survey-based information on mental illnesses, including prevalence, diagnosis and treatment, psychological wellbeing, and public attitudes. The user seeks data across populations (children, parents, adults, physicians) and related factors such as data sharing, digital health use, and socioeconomic context.	A document is relevant to the query “psychische erkrankungen” if it directly discusses mental illnesses or mental health, for example by measuring diagnosis or treatment of psychische/psychische Störungen, reporting prevalence, hospitalizations for emotional problems, use of psychotherapeutic care or medication, or attitudes and stigma toward people with mental illness. Surveys that include variables such as “psychische Erkrankung” alongside other conditions, ask about chronic psychological conditions, psychotherapeutic treatment, or “psychisches Wohlbefinden,” or assess parental ratings of a child’s “psychische Verfassung” count as relevant. By contrast, materials primarily about politics, telecommunications, internet use, trade policy, or general health without an explicit mental-health component are non-relevant, even if they contain broad well-being or medical context. Edge cases include perinatal or pediatric studies mentioning “psychische und ärztliche Versorgung” or twin/personality research: these are relevant only if they include concrete measures of mental disorders or clinically framed mental health outcomes; personality tests or cognitive tasks without a disorder context are not. Content on substance use framed as psychological/psychiatric disorders or on “Psychologisierung” (societal labeling of problems as mental illness) can be relevant, whereas sections on unrelated domains like animal welfare or internet security are not.
7488	psychische belastung	The user is seeking survey-based information on psychological stress, including how it is measured, experienced, and influenced across contexts such as work, education, family/partnerships, and health. They want factors, prevalence, and effects on well-being and performance, particularly within occupational safety and organizational settings.	A document is relevant if it meaningfully addresses psychological stress/burden (psychische Belastung) as a condition, cause, or outcome—using terms like seelische Belastung, psychisches Wohlbefinden, mental strain, stress, or burnout—especially in contexts such as work, study, family, health, or relationships. Clear signals include scales or indices of mental strain, questions on time pressure, social conflict, organizational problems, or “nervliche Belastungen,” and consequences like anxiety, depression, reduced performance, or absenteeism (e.g., “psychische Belastungen am Arbeitsplatz,” “psychische und physische Belastung,” “psychische Wirkungen” of experiences). Examples that qualify are teacher surveys on “Belastung durch Schüler,” workplace modules listing “psychische Belastungen” alongside hazards, or health sections capturing mental well-being and stress-related complaints. A document is non-relevant if “Belastung” refers only to physical, environmental, mechanical, or administrative loads without a mental component, or if “psychische” appears merely as a token in a list with no substantive treatment. Edge cases: combined phrases like “psychische und physische Belastung” are relevant; topics like AIDS, sexuality, addiction, or family life qualify only when they assess mental strain or well-being, whereas discussions of general “Belastung” or “Belastbarkeit” without psychological context do not.
79	environment	Identify surveys and datasets examining environmental awareness, perceived environmental conditions in residential areas, and related attitudes and behaviors—linked to housing, neighborhood composition (including foreigners), mobility, health/quality of life, and political participation—primarily in Germany with some EU/Luxembourg coverage. Includes interest in instruments like the 2024 Environmental Consciousness in Germany survey and modules on environmental policy and nuclear energy.	A document is relevant to the query “environment” when it substantively addresses the natural environment or environmental issues, such as environmental awareness and behavior, pollution, climate/air quality, environmental policy, health–environment links, or willingness to support environmental protection (e.g., the Environmental Consciousness in Germany series, EU attitudes toward environment modules, or surveys on nuclear energy and environmental risks). Housing or neighborhood studies are relevant if they explicitly measure environmental conditions in the living environment—clean air, perceived environmental problems, expected changes in local environmental issues, or satisfaction with environmental conditions—even when embedded among broader housing topics. Items are only marginally relevant when “environment” appears as one life-domain among many (e.g., a general quality-of-life list) or as a single rating area for government performance without deeper environmental content. Documents using “environment” to mean social/professional/research settings (e.g., research environment of professors, functional illiteracy in the professional environment, crime in the local environment) are non-relevant unless they tie back to ecological or environmental protection themes. Edge cases include surveys focused on mobility, foreigners, or voting that become relevant only if they include dedicated sections on environmental attitudes, policies, or behaviors; mere keyword mentions in metadata or headings without topical discussion should be treated as non-relevant.
7939	psychologie	The user seeks psychology-related content within the listed surveys and projects, including attitudes toward psychology and science, psychological knowledge/tests and methods, mental health and counseling, and measures of personality and social development. They likely want datasets or documentation on variables and analyses tied to psychological diagnostics (e.g., psychometric quality in special education) across different populations.	A document is relevant to the query “psychologie” if it substantively treats psychology as a discipline or practice—for example by discussing psychological constructs, psychometric quality of tests, mental health or counseling, or public attitudes toward psychology’s scientific status. Clear matches include surveys that measure interest in psychology, compare the standing of psychology among sciences, analyze personality and social behavior development in youth, or evaluate diagnostic/assessment procedures in educational contexts. Documents focused solely on international politics, economics, housing, or education policy without a psychological dimension, or that merely list “Psychologie” alongside other fields without psychology-specific variables or analysis, are non-relevant. Edge cases include multi-topic barometers: they are relevant only if they contain items on psychology (e.g., use of psychological counseling, attitudes toward psychology, psychometric criteria), while occurrences limited to journal titles, institutional names, or metadata are not. Another borderline case is science-comparison content (e.g., USSR vs. USA) that explicitly compares psychology among disciplines, which can be relevant; generic boilerplate mentions are not.
81	climate change	The user is looking for survey-based evidence on public attitudes, behaviors, and policy preferences related to climate change and the energy transition—primarily in Germany and the EU—including support for specific measures (e.g., CO2 taxes, speed limits), perceived impacts, mobility habits, and detailed demographic/methodological metadata.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses climate change or closely related themes such as climate protection, mitigation/adaptation policies, public attitudes, and the energy transition—for example, surveys on CO2 taxes, speed limits, kerosene taxes, electric vehicles, or assessments of Germany/EU climate measures and their impacts. Methodological descriptions (sampling, demographics, randomization) are still relevant when they frame studies about climate change opinions or behaviors, like mobility choices tied to emissions or perceived climate risks. Mixed-topic surveys remain relevant if climate change is a major module, even alongside other themes (poverty, elections), and content using synonyms like “climate protection,” “energy transition,” or policy areas (transport, agriculture, power supply) aimed at emissions reduction qualifies. By contrast, documents where “climate change” appears only incidentally in long lists without analysis, or pieces focused solely on unrelated issues (e.g., healthcare reform, general lobbying without a climate angle, or “organizational climate”) are non-relevant. Edge cases include environmental-awareness studies that discuss noise or litter but not climate change (non-relevant), versus mobility or ticketing policies discussed explicitly as climate measures (relevant).
810	bildungsgrad	The user seeks information on “Bildungsgrad” (educational attainment) as captured in socio-demographic surveys—especially variables for the highest education of respondents, parents, and main earners. They may also be looking for research on intergenerational effects, such as how grandparents’ education influences young adults’ attainment (e.g., Abitur).	A document is relevant to the query “bildungsgrad” if it explicitly contains variables or analysis on educational attainment, such as “höchster Bildungsgrad des Befragten/Eltern/Großeltern,” years of schooling, or school-leaving certificates (e.g., Abitur), or if it centers an analysis on education outcomes (like the SOEP study on grandparental education affecting Abitur by age 21). Survey descriptions that list “Bildungsgrad,” “Schulbildung,” “höchster Schulabschluss,” or “Bildungsniveau” in the demographics for respondents, partners, parents, or household heads are also relevant, even if education is not the main topic. By contrast, materials focused on immigration, religion, politics, or lifestyle that lack any field capturing education level are non-relevant; if they only mention “Bildung” as a policy area or expenditure category (education spending) without an attainment measure, that is weakly or non-relevant. Edge cases include datasets where “Bildungsgrad” appears only in metadata (e.g., interviewer’s education) or as a single demographic item in a long topic list—these are still relevant but with low topical strength compared to studies primarily about educational attainment. Synonyms and related terms like “Bildungsabschluss,” “Schulabschluss,” or “länderspezifischer Bildungsgrad” should be treated as matches, while generic mentions of “Bildung” without a level or credential should not.
8246	politisches engagement	The user seeks data and analysis on political and civic engagement in Germany—who participates, how, and why—spanning contexts like foundations, local politics, environmentalism, refugee aid, and youth activism. They want comparative insights across demographic and regional groups (e.g., women, LSBTIQ, students, retirees) on motivations, barriers, attitudes, and participation behaviors from multiple surveys.	A document is relevant if it addresses political engagement as attitudes or behaviors such as political interest, party membership, voting, participation in protests or Bürgerinitiativen, digital activism, or volunteering with a political aim (e.g., refugee advocacy, environmental campaigning, local policy involvement). Survey descriptions that measure political participation, efficacy, policy preferences, or readiness to engage (especially among women, youth, retirees, or specific communities like LSBTIQ) are clearly on-topic; examples include items on demonstrations, petitions, civic organizations, or collaboration with authorities. Materials focused solely on non-political aspects—housing conditions, environmental quality, or philanthropic administration (e.g., foundation assets, legal form)—are non-relevant unless they explicitly link to civic or political action, motives, or policy influence. Edge cases include “soziales Engagement” that is purely charitable (borderline unless tied to public policy or advocacy) and documents using “Engagement” in other senses (e.g., employee engagement), which are not relevant. References to motivations, barriers, and outcomes of engagement (including digital and episodic forms) strengthen relevance, whereas demographic lists without a participation or politics component do not.
828	nachhaltigkeit	The query seeks empirical studies and survey datasets on sustainability—covering concepts, public attitudes, and behaviors (especially sustainable food consumption and climate protection)—with representative German/European samples, methods, and demographic breakdowns. It also looks for comparative social indicator time series that track sustainability alongside quality of life and social cohesion.	A document is relevant to the query “nachhaltigkeit” when sustainability is a central focus, whether conceptual (definitions and dimensions) or empirical (attitudes, behaviors, or policies across environmental, social, and economic aspects). Strong examples include representative surveys on sustainability, analyses of sustainable food consumption and demand for Bio/Fair Trade products using methods like Multiple Correspondence Analysis, and indicator frameworks such as the European System of Social Indicators that treat sustainability as a core pillar. Partially relevant items are multipurpose surveys where sustainability is one module among others (e.g., COVID-19 polls that include climate protection/sustainability) or technology studies (e.g., urban drones) that explicitly measure perceived sustainability alongside safety and utility. An important edge case is the German use of “Nachhaltigkeit” to mean durability or lasting impact (e.g., program effectiveness or the legacy of events like World Youth Day), which matches the keyword but may not address environmental sustainability. Non-relevant documents are those that only mention the term in passing without substantive data, analysis, or discussion, or that focus on unrelated topics (e.g., smartphone usage) without a clear link to sustainability practices or outcomes.
8382	politische werte	The user is looking for empirical surveys and datasets that measure political values and orientations—such as political interest, efficacy, participation, and party preference—alongside demographic correlates. They want sources (e.g., Eurobarometer, youth/Gen Z panels) to analyze how political values have evolved over time in Germany and Europe, particularly among young people.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses political values or closely linked constructs such as value scales and orientations (e.g., importance of individual, occupational, or societal values; postmaterialism), ideological self-placement (left–right), authoritarian/libertarian attitudes, political interest/efficacy, trust in institutions, party preference, and participation. Surveys and applications like Eurobarometer, EU Profiler, or youth/Gen Z studies that analyze democracy satisfaction, EU integration attitudes, policy issue positions, and the salience of value priorities clearly fit, even when they use terms like Werthaltungen, Wertvorstellungen, gesellschaftliche Werte, politische Wirksamkeit, or Entfremdung von Politik. Non-relevant are items where “Werte” denotes numeric amounts rather than values (e.g., trade “Wert und Anteil” in export tables 1913–1933) or descriptions of workplace/industrial conditions without a substantive link to political value orientations. Edge cases include texts about life or religious values that lack a political connection (borderline) versus pieces on media use or civic engagement that become relevant when tied to political values or orientations. Documents in various country contexts or languages remain relevant if the central focus is the measurement or discussion of political values and related attitudes.
8951	politische einstellungen	The user seeks survey-based data and analyses on political attitudes and participation in Germany—especially among university students, but also youth and the general public. Topics span party preference, left–right ideology, protest behavior, views on democracy and institutions, higher-education politics, foreign and security policy, media use, and demographics.	A document is relevant to “politische einstellungen” if it measures or analyzes people’s political attitudes such as ideological self-placement (e.g., Left–Right scales), party identification or preference, evaluations of politicians and institutions, and positions on concrete issues. Examples that clearly qualify include surveys of students in Köln covering preferences for university political groups and attitudes toward SDS/APO/DKP/ADF, views on emergency laws, banning the NPD, recognition of the GDR, Vietnam, NATO/Wehrdienst, as well as scales on political participation, protest, democracy, and trust. Documents become non-relevant when they only list demographics, media use, consumer behavior, or technical survey variables without linking them to political attitudes or values. Edge cases include mixed-topic datasets: they are still relevant if they explicitly contain constructs like Parteipräferenz, Links–Rechts, or “politische Werte,” but a text where “Einstellungen” means non-political “settings” (e.g., software) or where politics is only mentioned in passing would be non-relevant.
9035	politics	The user is seeking comprehensive surveys and analyses on political attitudes, participation, and culture—especially post‑election developments—along with the role and credibility of traditional and social media, journalist–politician relations, and opinion polls. The information spans multiple countries and groups (e.g., Germany, UK, GDR) and covers voting behavior, trust in institutions, extremism, women and youth engagement, and political socialization with detailed demographics.	A document is relevant if it substantively addresses politics as civic life and institutions—e.g., post‑election developments, citizens’ trust in parties and leaders, voting behavior and left–right self‑placement, political participation, or the role and influence of media and social networks on democracy and opinion formation. Empirical surveys and studies that measure political attitudes, media trust, opinion polls, journalist–politician relations, or demographic correlates of political behavior (such as youth, students, or women’s political engagement) are strong matches. Historical or country‑specific analyses that frame issues as political—like estimates of political prisoners in the GDR, foreign policy views, or satisfaction with democracy—are also relevant. By contrast, items that use “politics” metaphorically (office politics), general media usage without a political dimension, or purely technical/social media platform discussions without political information behavior are non‑relevant. Edge cases include education or culture studies: they are relevant only if they assess political knowledge, civic education, or college politics; otherwise they fall outside the scope.
9089	political trust	The user is seeking survey data and analyses on political trust—confidence in institutions, parties, politicians, and democracy—alongside electoral behavior and policy attitudes. They aim to compare levels, trends, and determinants of political trust across countries and over time using rich, demographically detailed datasets.	A document is relevant to the query “political trust” if it measures or discusses trust or confidence in political institutions, actors, processes, or regimes (e.g., parliament, government, courts, police, political parties and leaders, presidents/prime ministers, and international organizations like the EU, NATO, OSCE, and the UN). The paragraph contains many such examples: surveys listing “trust in institutions and political leaders,” “political trust,” “trust in the Senator,” “trust in democracy and politics,” or item batteries on trust in parliament, government, judiciary, and parties, as well as “most trusted/least trusted institution” and trust in NATO/EU/UN. Social cohesion or moral-orientation studies are also relevant when they include institutional trust at local, regional, or federal levels; by contrast, measures of generalized interpersonal trust (“trust in fellow citizens”) are only tangential unless explicitly linked to political institutions. Documents that focus solely on electoral behavior, party preference, media consumption, economic conditions, or demographics without any trust/confidence items are non-relevant. Edge cases that still count include historical or regime-specific “confidence” questions (e.g., trust in SED leadership or Gorbachev), and phrasing such as “confidence,” “most/least trusted politician/institution,” or “trusted source of political news” when these refer to political actors or institutions.
9169	political interest	The user seeks studies and survey data that measure political interest (levels, topics followed, and information sources) and analyze how it varies across demographics and contexts. They want to understand its links to participation and attitudes toward parties, elites, gender equality, and key policy issues.	A document is relevant if it directly measures, describes, or analyzes individuals’ political interest—such as levels of interest in politics, interest in specific political topics, changes over time, or determinants like education, region, gender, and media use. Examples include surveys of women’s interest in politics, students’ political interest, “extent to which informed,” frequency of political discussions, sources used for political information, and interest in election campaigns or results. It is also relevant when political interest appears as a variable within broader studies of participation, ideology, or socialization (e.g., parental political interest, left–right self-placement with an interest measure, comparisons across GDR/FRG or UK). Non-relevant cases include uses of “interest” that mean special interest groups, party interests, or economic interest rates, as well as documents listing non-political interests (music/TV genres) without linking them to political information behavior, or analyses of politics that never address interest levels. Edge cases: brief or metadata-only mentions of “political interest” can still be relevant; conversely, pieces on equal rights or European integration are relevant only if they include an explicit measure of interest in politics or elections, and country- or period-specific studies remain relevant if they assess individuals’ political interest.
9243	political efficacy	The query seeks definitions and measures of political efficacy—especially internal and external efficacy—and where these are captured in social surveys. It aims to identify relevant datasets and survey items (e.g., German Internet Panel, Eurobarometer, EU studies) to analyze citizens’ perceived influence and understanding of politics and their links to participation and attitudes.	A document is relevant if it measures or discusses political efficacy—typically internal efficacy (one’s ability to understand politics and participate) and external efficacy (belief that politicians/government are responsive to citizens). Clear signals include survey items such as “I have a good understanding of important political issues,” “politicians care what ordinary people think,” or “politicians strive for close contact with the population,” as well as explicit mentions of “internal/external political efficacy,” “political effectiveness” (as a synonym), or EU-specific variants (e.g., efficacy regarding EU institutions). Study descriptions, scales, experimental manipulations, or results from panels and election studies (e.g., German Internet Panel, Eurobarometer, voting advice applications) that report these constructs also count as relevant. By contrast, documents about self-efficacy in non-political domains (teacher self-efficacy, parental self-efficacy, program efficacy, or “efficacy” of a training/intervention) are non-relevant even though they contain the word “efficacy.” Edge cases include uses of “effectiveness” that refer to party/government performance (not relevant) versus citizen perceived “responsivity,” “influence,” or “ability to assess political issues” (relevant).
928	corona	The user is seeking representative survey data and analyses on the COVID-19 (corona) pandemic in Germany, covering public attitudes, trust in institutions and science, evaluation of government measures, risk perception, information behavior, and adoption of the Corona-Warn-App with demographics. This includes repeated polls and panel studies (e.g., forsa, Science Barometer, Mannheim Corona Study) conducted in 2020 tracking concerns, behaviors, and political views.	A document is relevant if it addresses the coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic (often called “corona,” especially in German contexts), such as public opinion, policy measures, science communication, or behaviors during the crisis. Concrete matches include representative surveys or studies like the Science Barometer Corona Special, forsa’s government-commissioned polls, or the Mannheim Corona Study that cover topics such as trust in science, assessment of restrictions, mask mandates, vaccination willingness, and use of the Corona-Warn-App, including their questionnaires, demographic breakdowns, and weighting details. Technical materials that primarily list question batteries, methodology, or coded variables are still relevant when they are explicitly tied to corona-related attitudes or behaviors. Non-relevant items use “corona” in other senses (e.g., solar corona, electrical corona discharge, dental “coronal,” the beer brand, or place names like Corona, California). Edge cases include documents about the pandemic that use only terms like COVID-19 or SARS‑CoV‑2 (still relevant by topic), whereas pieces that merely name-drop “corona” without substantive discussion should be treated as non-relevant.
9616	politikverdrossenheit	The query seeks empirical studies and survey data on Politikverdrossenheit (political disaffection) in Germany—its definitions, causes, and typical triggers, especially during the COVID-19 period. It focuses on factors like migration, globalization, digitalization, media use and credibility, conspiracy beliefs, values, trust in institutions, democracy attitudes, demographics, and political participation, and how these are measured in representative surveys.	A document is relevant if it directly examines, measures, or explains Politikverdrossenheit (political disaffection), for example by presenting survey scales, determinants, and contexts in Germany. This passage is highly relevant because it includes a 2020 COVID-era study on causes of disaffection (e.g., perceived threats from migration, digitization, globalization), details on sampling and instruments, and multiple batteries that explicitly label “Politikverdrossenheit” alongside close proxies such as political efficacy, democracy satisfaction, trust in institutions, media credibility, and conspiracy beliefs. Youth and election studies that include items like “parties only want votes,” “citizens have little influence,” or “parties use the state as a self‑service shop” also qualify as relevant operationalizations. Non‑relevant content would be lists or metadata that never touch political disaffection, or sections about unrelated topics (e.g., housing or consumption) without linking them to cynicism/disengagement. Edge cases include documents that mention the term only once: they become relevant if they offer measures, findings, or conceptualization, and may also be relevant when using synonyms (political cynicism, disengagement) that clearly map to Politikverdrossenheit.
974	psychische gesundheit	The user seeks information on mental health (psychological wellbeing), including how it is measured and its prevalence, determinants, and outcomes in population studies. Focus is on EU/German surveys covering coping, stress, depression, help-seeking, social support, substance use, and public attitudes/stigma.	A document is relevant if it directly addresses mental health, such as modules on “psychisches Wohlbefinden,” measures of depression or anxiety, scales of psychological functioning (e.g., self-efficacy, coping, loneliness), or use of mental health services (psychotherapy, psychotropic medication, psychiatric hospitalization). Survey descriptions that assess attitudes toward people with mental or emotional problems, parental reports on children’s mental state, or self-assessed psychological health also qualify, even when embedded in broader public health or social surveys. By contrast, content focused on unrelated topics like telecommunications, energy policy, agriculture, or general internet usage without a mental-health component is non-relevant. Edge cases include general health studies that include both physical and psychological scales (still relevant), substance-use surveys that also capture mental disorders (relevant), or documents that mention “psychische Störung” only in a discrimination checklist without further mental-health detail (marginal relevance). Synonymous German terms such as “psychische Befindlichkeit,” “psychische Verfassung,” and “psychische Erkrankung” should be treated as matches for the query “psychische gesundheit.”
19136	migra	The query "migra" likely indicates a need for information about migration — its causes, patterns, and effects (e.g., academic migration, refugee flows, labor migration) — and about empirical sources and surveys used to study these topics. The searcher is probably looking for datasets, study results, or policy and integration information (questions, variables, and measurements) to analyze migration outcomes and public attitudes.	A document is relevant to the keyword "migra" when it centrally addresses migration-related concepts (migration, migrant, immigrat*, emigrat*, remigration, refugee, asylum, mobility) rather than using the letters as an incidental substring. Relevant signals include empirical studies or surveys of movers (e.g., research on Russian academics who migrated to Germany), policy analyses of immigration or asylum, datasets on flows and remittances, or measures of integration and labour mobility; presence of country names, sample sizes, survey methods, or terms like “refugee,” “emigration,” “return migration,” or “integration” strengthens relevance. Non‑relevant documents include those where "migra" appears in unrelated senses (e.g., “migraine,” brand names, or coincidental strings) or where migration is only briefly mentioned in passing; short, single-line mentions or meta-data hits without substantive migration content are low value. Edge cases to watch: internal mobility studies (moving within a country), digitization-driven mobility, or non‑English sources using the stem (migra-, migración, migrazione) can be relevant if the topical context is migration, so check surrounding context (abstract, keywords, methods, population) to confirm true relevance.
21585	linksrechtsskala	A variable capturing ideological position on a left–right continuum — either respondents' self-placement or coders' placement of parties/programmes — used to measure political orientation across surveys (e.g., Eurobarometer, ALLBUS, national election studies, manifesto codings). Researchers use it to analyze party positions, vote choice, policy preferences, and trends in political ideology.	A document is relevant if it explicitly contains a left–right (Links–Rechts) scale or variables about left–right placement — for example survey items labeled "LinksRechtsSkala", "Selbsteinstufung auf einem Links–Rechts-Kontinuum", party positions coded on a left–right dimension, or dataset fields showing party or respondent placement on a left–right scale (e.g. EMCS/Euromanifesto, EES, ALLBUS, ESS modules with LinksRechts variables). Good examples of relevant records are codebooks and datasets that list "Einstufung der Parteien ... auf einem LinksRechtsKontinuum", "Selbsteinstufung LinksRechts", or "LinksRechtsPositionen der Partei" as actual variables. Non‑relevant documents either lack any left–right measure (only list other scales such as authoritarian/liberal, pro/anti‑EU, or issue indices) or use the tokens "links" or "right" in unrelated senses (hyperlinks, legal "Rechts", directional "right"), which are false positives. Edge cases include multilingual or concatenated spellings (LinksRechts, Links–Rechts, LinksRechtsSkala) — these should be treated as relevant — and texts that discuss left–right ideology only conceptually (no variable or coded measure), which are borderline: useful for background but not for variable extraction.
21895	linksrechts	A user searching "linksrechts" is likely looking for documentation and data on how German respondents interpret and place themselves on the left–right ideological scale ("links"/"rechts"), including the open-ended responses (F029/F030) and their coding in surveys like ALLBUS 2008, GIP and GLES. They want the question wording, variable names/coding and guidance on using these measures for analyses of political attitudes, party positioning and related electoral or candidate-level research.	A document is relevant to the keyword "linksrechts" if it explicitly discusses left–right political orientation (e.g. the German term "Links–Rechts", "LinksRechtsSelbsteinstufung") or contains the survey items/variables measuring it (such as questions F029/F030 or LinksRechts self-placement and party/voter left–right ratings). Examples of clearly relevant documents are codebooks or datasets that record ALLBUS/GIP/GLES variables on left–right self-placement, question wording, response coding, or experiments that prime or vary left–right measures. Documents are not relevant if "links" and "rechts" appear only as ordinary directional words, hyperlinks, legal terms ("Rechtsanwalt"), or in unrelated topic lists (e.g. technical metadata, timestamps, or non-political modules). Edge cases include records that mention "LinksRechts" only in a long variable list without providing the actual items (partially relevant) and documents using English synonyms ("left–right", "left right scale") or experimental descriptions of how the left–right question was rotated or primed (which should be considered relevant).
28676	worklife	The user wants empirical evidence and data about work–life balance: how employment hours, gender and parental status (and shocks like COVID‑19) affect life satisfaction, work–family conflict and related outcomes. They are looking for relevant studies and survey datasets (e.g. GSOEP, GESIS/GIP, EVS, ISSP, EU‑LFS, LEEPB) and variable documentation to analyze or replicate findings.	A document is relevant to the keyword "worklife" when it directly addresses work–life balance, reconciliation of employment and family responsibilities, work–life conflict, working hours, leave arrangements, childcare/eldercare, telework or measures that affect how paid work and private life interact. For example, the paragraph cites explicit modules and papers on "WorkLife Conflict and Self‑Rated Health," EU ad‑hoc modules on "Reconciliation between work and family life," measures of working time, childcare arrangements and parental leave, and surveys asking about home‑office or reduced hours—all strong relevance signals. Documents that are non‑relevant merely mention “work” or “life” in passing, are pure metadata/technical codebooks, or focus solely on unrelated topics (e.g., raw occupational codes, broad political opinion items) without variables linking employment to family or well‑being; however some COVID‑surveys that concentrate on infection risk may be borderline relevant if they also contain questions about changes in work situation, childcare or home‑office. Edge cases include long instrument descriptions or multilingual repeats: these can still be useful if they list specific variables (hours worked, childcare responsibility, leave taken, satisfaction with work–family balance), but should be judged on whether those variables or substantive analyses are actually present.
317	homeoffice	Seeking research and survey-based information on home office/telework in Germany during the COVID‑19 pandemic — including how prevalence changed, which occupations and social groups could or did work from home (indices of feasibility), and associated economic, health (e.g., compulsive working), family and policy impacts. The user likely wants data sources, study findings, and measures/variables used in German surveys to analyze telework effects and distribution.	A document is relevant to the query "homeoffice" if it treats telework/working from home as a central subject — for example empirical estimates of prevalence (e.g., Kohlrausch & Zucco 2020), indices measuring the ability to work from home, regression analyses of home office effects (e.g., on work addiction), or discussions of legal/policy attitudes toward a statutory right to home office. Relevant signals include explicit keywords and synonyms (homeoffice, Home Office, telework, Telearbeit, work from home), descriptions of survey modules that record current work location or changes in work situation, and analyses that compare occupational or social groups by home‑working ability. A document is non‑relevant when home office is only mentioned incidentally among many unrelated topics (e.g., a broad COVID survey that never records work location), or when it focuses on tangential items (general pandemic risk perception, tax policy, or EU politics) without linking them to remote working. Edge cases to watch: German‑language content or mixed multilingual texts are relevant if they contain the above signals; papers about digital tools or telecommunication infrastructure without worker/outcome data are partially relevant; and short, passing mentions of "working from home" (e.g., as one line in a long questionnaire) may be low relevance unless the dataset provides analyzable home‑office variables.
34932	rightwing	Seeking datasets and documentation on right‑wing politics and extremism — including party positions and Euroscepticism in EU elections, replication files and code, and a record of right‑wing extremist demonstrations in Germany (2005–2020). Also looking for survey variables and scales measuring right‑wing attitudes (e.g., Right‑Wing Authoritarianism, social dominance, xenophobia, antisemitism) and metadata from projects like EU Profiler, EUandI, ThüringenMonitor, ICCP and GESIS.	A document is relevant to the keyword "rightwing" when its primary content concerns right‑wing actors, ideologies, attitudes, or events — for example studies of right‑wing Eurosceptic parties in the European Parliament, datasets on right‑wing extremist demonstrations (the paragraph’s 3,290‑observation German demonstrations file is a direct hit), or surveys that include Right‑Wing Authoritarianism, xenophobia, AfD support, or related scales. The EP replication files that document greater coherence among right‑wing Eurosceptics and the ThüringenMonitor measures of right‑extremist attitudes are clearly relevant because they center on right‑wing politics and behaviors. By contrast, materials that only incidentally record a left–right self‑placement item or that focus on general demographics, EU procedures, or unrelated topics without substantive analysis of right‑wing phenomena are non‑relevant or only marginally relevant. Edge cases include texts that use “right” in a directional or non‑political sense, documents in other languages using terms like rechtsradikal/rechtsextrem, or studies of conservative policy positions that are relevant to some searches but less so for queries specifically about right‑wing extremism.
43698	covid19	Looking for datasets and research about the social, political and economic impacts of the COVID‑19 pandemic—especially surveys on public attitudes, behaviour changes, trust in institutions, vaccine acceptance, lockdown effects, and policy responses (many German/European data sources). The information need is to find usable survey data, codebooks and study descriptions for analysing how COVID‑19 affected wellbeing, work, families, solidarity and political opinions.	A document is relevant to the keyword "covid19" when it substantively studies the COVID‑19 pandemic — for example, surveys, datasets or articles that analyze lockdown effects, vaccination attitudes, contact‑tracing apps, sector closures or changes in employment and wellbeing during specific pandemic waves (e.g., German panel studies March–August 2020, KOMPAKK sector closure data, CoronaWarnApp usage, vaccination panel data). Highly relevant items typically report COVID‑specific variables (time frames, wave/sample sizes, measures of risk perception, trust, solidarity, behavior change, vaccination intent) and provide usable data or codebooks. Documents that only mention “COVID19” in passing, are metadata‑only, or focus on unrelated topics (e.g., general SDG consumer surveys without pandemic modules, preprints about publishing culture that are not COVID‑specific) should be considered non‑relevant. Edge cases include pre‑pandemic datasets used for COVID comparison (partially relevant), restricted/open question data that limit reuse, and multiple versions/translations of the same study (choose the latest complete version for highest relevance).
6346	worklifebalance	Seeking research-based guidance on how individuals, employers and policymakers can achieve work–life balance and an equitable division of paid and family work for both women and men. The user also wants empirical evidence—survey and panel data (including COVID‑19 impact studies) on workplace conditions, policies, and outcomes (income, employment, wellbeing) that enable or hinder partnership-based sharing of work and family responsibilities.	A document is relevant to the keyword "worklifebalance" when it explicitly studies or measures the compatibility of work and family life (German: "Vereinbarkeit") or contains variables that operationalize that concept — for example, division of paid and unpaid work between partners, working hours (full/part‑time, overtime, shift work), childcare availability and costs, parental leave, telework/remote work, and measures of work–family conflict or satisfaction. In the supplied paragraph the study titled "Betriebliche Gelingensbedingungen einer partnerschaftlichen Aufteilung von Erwerbs‑ und Familienarbeit" (parents’ division of work), the pairfam panels, and the COVID‑19 everyday‑experience panel (school/kita closures, changes in work situation) are highly relevant because they directly address how work and family responsibilities interact. Documents that focus on unrelated themes (e.g. religion, nuclear energy, broad value surveys like some EVS/ISSP modules) or are purely metadata/methodological descriptions without variables on childcare, hours or role division would be non‑relevant or only background‑relevant. Edge cases: a text that merely mentions “work” or “family” without linking the two is only weakly relevant; cross‑national surveys (ISSP, EVS) can be useful if they include specific family/work items or time‑use modules but may be less useful if they only have general attitudes; likewise, studies limited to one gender, one age cohort, or that are outdated should be treated as partial evidence rather than fully generalizable.
