21585	linksrechtsskala	publication	The searcher wants a clear definition and practical overview of the "links–rechts–skala" (left–right political self‑placement scale), including how it is measured and used in surveys and research. They are likely seeking information on different scale formats and orientations, validity and interpretation issues, and the scale's relevance for groups like young people and cross‑national comparisons.	A document is relevant to the keyword "linksrechtsskala" when it explicitly treats the left–right political scale (e.g., mentions "LinksRechtsSkala", "left–right scale", or gives self‑placement items such as "0 = left, 10 = right"), reports empirical results from such scales, or analyzes how that scale is constructed, presented, or interpreted (for example questionnaire experiments varying horizontal/vertical orientation, youth interviews about what "left" and "right" mean, or manifesto-based left–right positionings). Sections that compare ideological dimensions (economic vs. socio‑cultural left–right axes), present typologies of political positioning, or use comparative party/program data to derive left–right scores are clearly relevant. Documents are not relevant when they discuss voting, turnout, or social structure without any left–right measure, or when "links" or "rechts" appear in non‑ideological senses (e.g., anatomical left/right, web links, or legal "Recht") and do not address political positioning. Edge cases include studies that measure related concepts (political interest, trust, or partisanship) and report left–right only as a background variable—these are partially relevant if they provide the actual scale items or analysis, but less so if they only use the label without detail.
21895	linksrechts	publication	Looking for research and empirical evidence on what Germans mean by the political labels "left" and "right" — which coherent conceptions exist (e.g., economic, cultural, system-oriented or emotional) and how social-structural factors (education, class, age, East/West region) shape those associations. Also want studies using ALLBUS and similar surveys on measurement issues (e.g., middle category), how meanings changed over time, and the implications for voting behavior and political participation.	A document is relevant to the keyword "linksrechts" when it substantively treats the political left–right dimension — for example, analyses of left/right self‑placement, semantic associations with "links" and "rechts," survey results (ALLBUS, Politbarometer, ISSP), measurement methods (e.g., correspondence analysis like CAGalt), or how social structure (education, region, age, class) shapes left–right concepts. Concrete signals of relevance are discussion of ideological concepts (economic vs. cultural vs. system‑related meanings), empirical findings about variation in associations, or case studies that connect movements or attitudes (e.g., "MosaikLinke," Montagsmahnwachen, antisemitism) to left–right positioning. A document is non‑relevant if the words "links" or "rechts" appear only incidentally (hyperlinks, anatomical left/right, layout directions), occur in metadata or lists without substantive treatment, or if the piece focuses on unrelated measurement issues without applying them to left–right ideology. Ambiguous edge cases include studies of extremism or prejudice — these are relevant only when they explicitly link those phenomena to left/right self‑placement or use the left–right dimension as an analytical variable.
317	homeoffice	publication	Information on the prevalence, access, use and effects of home office (remote/mobile work) — including who can work from home, how much work is done and recognised there, impacts on productivity, wellbeing and gender/social inequalities, and organisational or spatial consequences. The query also seeks empirical findings from German surveys (e.g. BIBB‑BAuA, SOEP, ALLBUS, LPP/LLP, DEAS), changes driven by COVID‑19, and related legal and policy implications.	A document is relevant to the keyword "homeoffice" when it explicitly treats working from home (homeoffice/telework/remote work) — for example by reporting prevalence rates, access and usage patterns, contractual recognition, sectoral or regional breakdowns, demographic differences (age, gender, class), effects on productivity, mental health or work–life balance, or legal and organizational regulations introduced during the pandemic. Highly relevant items include representative surveys that give percentages of employees who work from home, longitudinal comparisons (pre/post‑COVID), studies of homeoffice arrangements and equipment, and evaluations of policy or company rules that enable or restrict homeworking. Documents that focus only on general digitalization, industrial automation, or office employment without saying where the work is done are non‑relevant or only marginally relevant. Edge cases include research on coworking, mobile work or digital collaboration tools — these are partially relevant if they explicitly compare or situate those modes with homeoffice, and policy papers on childcare/lockdowns are relevant only if they measure homeoffice uptake or consequences. Finally, consider methodology and context: small qualitative case studies or single‑firm reports may be informative but less generalizable than large representative surveys, and region‑ or language‑specific statistics (e.g. German datasets) matter for scope.
6346	worklifebalance	publication	A search for "worklifebalance" seeks a concise overview of the concept, its common workplace and policy measures (e.g., flexible hours, telework, parental leave, childcare) and the evidence on their benefits and risks. It also aims to understand practical implementation challenges and gendered effects (career impacts, long‑hours culture, boundary‑setting) to guide employers, HR professionals and policymakers.	A document is relevant to the keyword "worklifebalance" when its primary topic is the reconciliation of work and private life (often labelled WLB, work‑life balance, or Vereinbarkeit), or when it provides substantive discussion of measures, policies or practices such as flexible hours, part‑time work, teleworking/home‑office, childcare/eldercare provision, parental leave, managerial implementation, or empirical studies of the long‑hours culture. Practical case studies (e.g. in academia, corporate HR, public administration), evaluations of WLB programmes, cross‑country comparisons, gendered analyses (fathers, mothers, intersectionality) and COVID‑era home‑office impacts are all clearly relevant examples. A document is non‑relevant if WLB is only mentioned in passing (e.g. a long bibliography or a glossary entry), if the focus is on an unrelated theme (e.g. pure diversity theory without any WLB measures), or if the term appears solely as a metaphor with no substantive treatment of work–private boundary issues. Edge cases to watch for: relevant material may be in other languages (German texts using WorkLifeBalance/WLB), use variant spellings/acronyms, or treat WLB critically (e.g. as self‑exploitation) — these are still relevant but may require attention to scope (policy vs. critique) and context (national labour law, sector, or methodology).
19136	migra	research_data	The query "migra" likely indicates a need for information about migration — its causes, patterns, and effects (e.g., academic migration, refugee flows, labor migration) — and about empirical sources and surveys used to study these topics. The searcher is probably looking for datasets, study results, or policy and integration information (questions, variables, and measurements) to analyze migration outcomes and public attitudes.	A document is relevant to the keyword "migra" when it centrally addresses migration-related concepts (migration, migrant, immigrat*, emigrat*, remigration, refugee, asylum, mobility) rather than using the letters as an incidental substring. Relevant signals include empirical studies or surveys of movers (e.g., research on Russian academics who migrated to Germany), policy analyses of immigration or asylum, datasets on flows and remittances, or measures of integration and labour mobility; presence of country names, sample sizes, survey methods, or terms like “refugee,” “emigration,” “return migration,” or “integration” strengthens relevance. Non‑relevant documents include those where "migra" appears in unrelated senses (e.g., “migraine,” brand names, or coincidental strings) or where migration is only briefly mentioned in passing; short, single-line mentions or meta-data hits without substantive migration content are low value. Edge cases to watch: internal mobility studies (moving within a country), digitization-driven mobility, or non‑English sources using the stem (migra-, migración, migrazione) can be relevant if the topical context is migration, so check surrounding context (abstract, keywords, methods, population) to confirm true relevance.
21585	linksrechtsskala	research_data	A variable capturing ideological position on a left–right continuum — either respondents' self-placement or coders' placement of parties/programmes — used to measure political orientation across surveys (e.g., Eurobarometer, ALLBUS, national election studies, manifesto codings). Researchers use it to analyze party positions, vote choice, policy preferences, and trends in political ideology.	A document is relevant if it explicitly contains a left–right (Links–Rechts) scale or variables about left–right placement — for example survey items labeled "LinksRechtsSkala", "Selbsteinstufung auf einem Links–Rechts-Kontinuum", party positions coded on a left–right dimension, or dataset fields showing party or respondent placement on a left–right scale (e.g. EMCS/Euromanifesto, EES, ALLBUS, ESS modules with LinksRechts variables). Good examples of relevant records are codebooks and datasets that list "Einstufung der Parteien ... auf einem LinksRechtsKontinuum", "Selbsteinstufung LinksRechts", or "LinksRechtsPositionen der Partei" as actual variables. Non‑relevant documents either lack any left–right measure (only list other scales such as authoritarian/liberal, pro/anti‑EU, or issue indices) or use the tokens "links" or "right" in unrelated senses (hyperlinks, legal "Rechts", directional "right"), which are false positives. Edge cases include multilingual or concatenated spellings (LinksRechts, Links–Rechts, LinksRechtsSkala) — these should be treated as relevant — and texts that discuss left–right ideology only conceptually (no variable or coded measure), which are borderline: useful for background but not for variable extraction.
21895	linksrechts	research_data	A user searching "linksrechts" is likely looking for documentation and data on how German respondents interpret and place themselves on the left–right ideological scale ("links"/"rechts"), including the open-ended responses (F029/F030) and their coding in surveys like ALLBUS 2008, GIP and GLES. They want the question wording, variable names/coding and guidance on using these measures for analyses of political attitudes, party positioning and related electoral or candidate-level research.	A document is relevant to the keyword "linksrechts" if it explicitly discusses left–right political orientation (e.g. the German term "Links–Rechts", "LinksRechtsSelbsteinstufung") or contains the survey items/variables measuring it (such as questions F029/F030 or LinksRechts self-placement and party/voter left–right ratings). Examples of clearly relevant documents are codebooks or datasets that record ALLBUS/GIP/GLES variables on left–right self-placement, question wording, response coding, or experiments that prime or vary left–right measures. Documents are not relevant if "links" and "rechts" appear only as ordinary directional words, hyperlinks, legal terms ("Rechtsanwalt"), or in unrelated topic lists (e.g. technical metadata, timestamps, or non-political modules). Edge cases include records that mention "LinksRechts" only in a long variable list without providing the actual items (partially relevant) and documents using English synonyms ("left–right", "left right scale") or experimental descriptions of how the left–right question was rotated or primed (which should be considered relevant).
28676	worklife	research_data	The user wants empirical evidence and data about work–life balance: how employment hours, gender and parental status (and shocks like COVID‑19) affect life satisfaction, work–family conflict and related outcomes. They are looking for relevant studies and survey datasets (e.g. GSOEP, GESIS/GIP, EVS, ISSP, EU‑LFS, LEEPB) and variable documentation to analyze or replicate findings.	A document is relevant to the keyword "worklife" when it directly addresses work–life balance, reconciliation of employment and family responsibilities, work–life conflict, working hours, leave arrangements, childcare/eldercare, telework or measures that affect how paid work and private life interact. For example, the paragraph cites explicit modules and papers on "WorkLife Conflict and Self‑Rated Health," EU ad‑hoc modules on "Reconciliation between work and family life," measures of working time, childcare arrangements and parental leave, and surveys asking about home‑office or reduced hours—all strong relevance signals. Documents that are non‑relevant merely mention “work” or “life” in passing, are pure metadata/technical codebooks, or focus solely on unrelated topics (e.g., raw occupational codes, broad political opinion items) without variables linking employment to family or well‑being; however some COVID‑surveys that concentrate on infection risk may be borderline relevant if they also contain questions about changes in work situation, childcare or home‑office. Edge cases include long instrument descriptions or multilingual repeats: these can still be useful if they list specific variables (hours worked, childcare responsibility, leave taken, satisfaction with work–family balance), but should be judged on whether those variables or substantive analyses are actually present.
317	homeoffice	research_data	Seeking research and survey-based information on home office/telework in Germany during the COVID‑19 pandemic — including how prevalence changed, which occupations and social groups could or did work from home (indices of feasibility), and associated economic, health (e.g., compulsive working), family and policy impacts. The user likely wants data sources, study findings, and measures/variables used in German surveys to analyze telework effects and distribution.	A document is relevant to the query "homeoffice" if it treats telework/working from home as a central subject — for example empirical estimates of prevalence (e.g., Kohlrausch & Zucco 2020), indices measuring the ability to work from home, regression analyses of home office effects (e.g., on work addiction), or discussions of legal/policy attitudes toward a statutory right to home office. Relevant signals include explicit keywords and synonyms (homeoffice, Home Office, telework, Telearbeit, work from home), descriptions of survey modules that record current work location or changes in work situation, and analyses that compare occupational or social groups by home‑working ability. A document is non‑relevant when home office is only mentioned incidentally among many unrelated topics (e.g., a broad COVID survey that never records work location), or when it focuses on tangential items (general pandemic risk perception, tax policy, or EU politics) without linking them to remote working. Edge cases to watch: German‑language content or mixed multilingual texts are relevant if they contain the above signals; papers about digital tools or telecommunication infrastructure without worker/outcome data are partially relevant; and short, passing mentions of "working from home" (e.g., as one line in a long questionnaire) may be low relevance unless the dataset provides analyzable home‑office variables.
34932	rightwing	research_data	Seeking datasets and documentation on right‑wing politics and extremism — including party positions and Euroscepticism in EU elections, replication files and code, and a record of right‑wing extremist demonstrations in Germany (2005–2020). Also looking for survey variables and scales measuring right‑wing attitudes (e.g., Right‑Wing Authoritarianism, social dominance, xenophobia, antisemitism) and metadata from projects like EU Profiler, EUandI, ThüringenMonitor, ICCP and GESIS.	A document is relevant to the keyword "rightwing" when its primary content concerns right‑wing actors, ideologies, attitudes, or events — for example studies of right‑wing Eurosceptic parties in the European Parliament, datasets on right‑wing extremist demonstrations (the paragraph’s 3,290‑observation German demonstrations file is a direct hit), or surveys that include Right‑Wing Authoritarianism, xenophobia, AfD support, or related scales. The EP replication files that document greater coherence among right‑wing Eurosceptics and the ThüringenMonitor measures of right‑extremist attitudes are clearly relevant because they center on right‑wing politics and behaviors. By contrast, materials that only incidentally record a left–right self‑placement item or that focus on general demographics, EU procedures, or unrelated topics without substantive analysis of right‑wing phenomena are non‑relevant or only marginally relevant. Edge cases include texts that use “right” in a directional or non‑political sense, documents in other languages using terms like rechtsradikal/rechtsextrem, or studies of conservative policy positions that are relevant to some searches but less so for queries specifically about right‑wing extremism.
43698	covid19	research_data	Looking for datasets and research about the social, political and economic impacts of the COVID‑19 pandemic—especially surveys on public attitudes, behaviour changes, trust in institutions, vaccine acceptance, lockdown effects, and policy responses (many German/European data sources). The information need is to find usable survey data, codebooks and study descriptions for analysing how COVID‑19 affected wellbeing, work, families, solidarity and political opinions.	A document is relevant to the keyword "covid19" when it substantively studies the COVID‑19 pandemic — for example, surveys, datasets or articles that analyze lockdown effects, vaccination attitudes, contact‑tracing apps, sector closures or changes in employment and wellbeing during specific pandemic waves (e.g., German panel studies March–August 2020, KOMPAKK sector closure data, CoronaWarnApp usage, vaccination panel data). Highly relevant items typically report COVID‑specific variables (time frames, wave/sample sizes, measures of risk perception, trust, solidarity, behavior change, vaccination intent) and provide usable data or codebooks. Documents that only mention “COVID19” in passing, are metadata‑only, or focus on unrelated topics (e.g., general SDG consumer surveys without pandemic modules, preprints about publishing culture that are not COVID‑specific) should be considered non‑relevant. Edge cases include pre‑pandemic datasets used for COVID comparison (partially relevant), restricted/open question data that limit reuse, and multiple versions/translations of the same study (choose the latest complete version for highest relevance).
6346	worklifebalance	research_data	Seeking research-based guidance on how individuals, employers and policymakers can achieve work–life balance and an equitable division of paid and family work for both women and men. The user also wants empirical evidence—survey and panel data (including COVID‑19 impact studies) on workplace conditions, policies, and outcomes (income, employment, wellbeing) that enable or hinder partnership-based sharing of work and family responsibilities.	A document is relevant to the keyword "worklifebalance" when it explicitly studies or measures the compatibility of work and family life (German: "Vereinbarkeit") or contains variables that operationalize that concept — for example, division of paid and unpaid work between partners, working hours (full/part‑time, overtime, shift work), childcare availability and costs, parental leave, telework/remote work, and measures of work–family conflict or satisfaction. In the supplied paragraph the study titled "Betriebliche Gelingensbedingungen einer partnerschaftlichen Aufteilung von Erwerbs‑ und Familienarbeit" (parents’ division of work), the pairfam panels, and the COVID‑19 everyday‑experience panel (school/kita closures, changes in work situation) are highly relevant because they directly address how work and family responsibilities interact. Documents that focus on unrelated themes (e.g. religion, nuclear energy, broad value surveys like some EVS/ISSP modules) or are purely metadata/methodological descriptions without variables on childcare, hours or role division would be non‑relevant or only background‑relevant. Edge cases: a text that merely mentions “work” or “family” without linking the two is only weakly relevant; cross‑national surveys (ISSP, EVS) can be useful if they include specific family/work items or time‑use modules but may be less useful if they only have general attitudes; likewise, studies limited to one gender, one age cohort, or that are outdated should be treated as partial evidence rather than fully generalizable.
12195	persönlichkeitsmerkmale	variables	The user wants a clear overview of personality traits and how to evaluate their own characteristics. They are looking for definitions of common traits (e.g., the Big Five) and simple guidance or items to self-assess where they see themselves.	The query "persönlichkeitsmerkmale" seeks information about personality traits, so a document that helps someone identify or describe typical traits is relevant. The provided paragraph is in German and repeatedly prompts the reader to "assess yourself," which is directly related to eliciting information about personality and therefore partially relevant. However, it is low-quality for this query because it contains no specific trait names (for example, introversion, conscientiousness, openness), no definitions, scoring, or examples, and is cluttered with repeated lines and "br" artifacts. A fully relevant document would include trait lists or models (Big Five), behavioral indicators, example items or scoring guidance, whereas this text might only be useful as a brief survey prompt or starting instruction but not as substantive information. Edge cases: it could be acceptable if the user wanted a short questionnaire header, but it is non-relevant if the user expects definitions, research, or concrete trait descriptions.
14255	konsum	variables	The user is looking for measures and survey questions about consumption and media use, including frequency of reading local, regional and national newspapers (and specific titles), watching news on public or private TV, and membership/knowledge of consumer associations and their magazines. They also want questions about personal consumption habits (wine, meat, various foods and drinks) and smoking frequency.	A document is relevant for the query "konsum" when it directly addresses consumption behavior or consumer topics — for example survey items asking how often people read local or national newspapers, whether they drink wine, eat meat, or smoke, or questions about consumer associations and magazines. The paragraph you provided contains many clearly relevant elements: frequency-of-use questions (e.g., "An wievielen Tagen … gelesen"), dietary frequency lists ("Essen Sie Fleisch", repeated item lists), and explicit consumer‑association prompts, all of which are central to consumption research. Documents that are non‑relevant mention "Konsum" only tangentially (e.g., as part of a company name or filename), discuss production/supply issues rather than end‑user consumption, or contain only survey metadata and response codes (KA, TNZ, wave notes) without behavioral content. Edge cases include ambiguous intent (if the user meant economic consumption vs. media/food consumption), documents that only include a single occurrence of the term in a header, or materials in a different language — these may be borderline relevant depending on whether the user needs raw survey items, coded data, or high‑level analysis. Prioritize texts with explicit frequency measures, question wording, or lists of consumer goods when matching for "konsum."
15640	karriere	variables	The query "karriere" (German for "career") indicates a need for information about building or advancing a professional life—such as career paths, job opportunities, required qualifications and skills, CV/interview advice, or company career pages. The user likely wants guidance on starting, changing, or progressing a career and finding relevant openings.	A document is relevant to the keyword "karriere" if it clearly focuses on careers, career development, job opportunities, CV/interview advice, or pathways within professions — for example, a German-language guide to switching careers, a company’s careers page, or a list of job openings. Because "karriere" is German, pages written in German or aimed at German-speaking jobseekers are usually more relevant; English pages about "career" can still be useful but may not match the user’s language intent. Non-relevant documents merely mentioning the word in passing, using it as a surname or brand name, or containing it only in unrelated lists are not helpful. Edge cases include pages where the term appears only inside large aggregated content (e.g., a long forum thread) or outdated job postings that no longer apply; these may require extra weighting or freshness checks. Signals that increase relevance include the term appearing in titles, headings, meta tags, structured job data, and in-depth, actionable content; weak signals are single occurrences, poor translations, or pages that focus on adjacent topics like general business news without career-specific information.
1743	lebenszufriedenheit	variables	The user is looking for a clear explanation of a German survey item about "Lebenszufriedenheit" — a single-item measure asking respondents to rate their overall life satisfaction on a 1–7 scale, introduced by two contrasting self-evaluation vignettes. They likely want to understand the question’s purpose, wording and how to administer or interpret responses in a survey or research context.	A document is relevant to the keyword "lebenszufriedenheit" when it directly addresses life satisfaction as a self-evaluation — for example the dialog between two friends about how satisfied they feel and the repeated 1–7 satisfaction question in this paragraph — or when it presents measurement items, Likert scales, or survey modes (CAWI, MAIL) used to assess life satisfaction. Content that discusses subjective well‑being, life satisfaction scales (e.g., explicit 1 = very unsatisfied to 7 = very satisfied), or translations of those questions into other languages is also highly relevant because it bears on how lebenszufriedenheit is operationalized and measured. A document is not relevant if it only uses the word "Leben" in other contexts (life insurance, biological life) or treats happiness abstractly without linking to personal satisfaction or self‑report measurement; a single offhand mention of "Lebenszufriedenheit" in a bibliography can be a weak match. Edge cases include materials that duplicate questionnaire items many times (noise but still relevant), methodological papers on survey administration (relevant if they concern measurement of life satisfaction, but only tangentially if they focus solely on sampling or statistics), and texts that use close synonyms (subjective well‑being, life quality) which should be considered relevant depending on whether they cover self‑rated satisfaction.
1817	mediennutzung	variables	The user wants to assess an individual's media usage and preferences, specifically how often they watch TV and read a daily newspaper and how much they like different music genres. They also want ratings of interest in various types of TV programs using a scale from "very much" to "not at all."	A document is relevant to the query "mediennutzung" if it directly addresses individuals' media consumption patterns — for example survey items asking how many days per week someone watches TV, how often they read a newspaper, or how much they like different music genres. Questionnaire text, lists of media types, and response scales (very strong/strong/medium/low/not at all) are strong indicators of relevance; even if the material is in German or contains repeated or slightly garbled lines, it still maps to media-use measurement. A document is non-relevant when it discusses media in other senses (media production, technical specs, advertising strategy) or treats “media” only tangentially without measuring usage behaviors. Edge cases include documents that only cover one medium (e.g., music preference but not TV/newspapers) — still relevant but narrower in scope — and methodological or theoretical papers about media effects that do not contain concrete usage questions, which may be borderline. Relevance is highest when the text contains explicit frequency measures, question wording, or Likert-style interest ratings that could be used to quantify media use.
18589	migranten	variables	A need to find or reproduce a survey measuring German public attitudes toward migrants, including items on contact with foreigners, perceived treatment and discrimination, integration (e.g., whether migrants can become “real” Germans), support for Islam instruction in schools, estimates of foreigner share, neighborhood preferences, and views on refugees’ risks or opportunities. The user is looking for the specific questionnaire items and response scales used to assess these attitudes.	A document is relevant to the keyword "migranten" when its main subject is migration or migrants — for example discussions of foreigners or refugees in Germany, public-opinion surveys about "in Deutschland lebende Ausländer", policies on integration or schooling (e.g., Islamunterricht), neighborhood preferences, or measured attitudes and discrimination scales. Concrete signals of relevance include mentions of synonyms like Ausländer, Flüchtlinge, Einwanderer/Zuwanderer, statistics on foreigner percentages, survey items asking about contact with migrants, or instruments showing Likert/scale responses about migrants. A document is non-relevant when the word appears only incidentally or in a different domain — for example IT/database migration, animal migration studies, or a passing quote that doesn’t address people, policy, or public attitudes. Edge cases include German-language materials (which are highly relevant if they discuss migrants), documents that discuss legal status vs cultural assimilation (both can be relevant but for different analytic needs), and methodological survey texts: questionnaires and scale descriptions are relevant even though they are not interpretive analyses. If a text only reports raw demographic counts (e.g., census tables) it is borderline but usually relevant; if it uses "migration" in a metaphorical or technical sense unrelated to human migration, it is not relevant.
19136	migra	variables	A survey variable capturing both respondents' migration status (East/West resident, commuter, or migrant) and their attitudes about migration related to EU enlargement. It asks whether people expect significant or limited migration from Eastern and Central Europe to the respondent’s country, whether that is positive or negative (and why), plus agree/disagree responses to statements about immigration and immigrants.	A document is relevant to the keyword "migra" when it discusses human migration, migrants, or migration-related survey variables—for example, the paragraph’s variable codes (1 = purely West, 3 = West migrant to the East) and the EU-enlargement questions about people moving from Eastern and Central Europe clearly match the intent. Relevant examples include survey documentation, questionnaire text about immigration attitudes, or analyses of East–West migration flows. Non-relevant documents merely containing the substring "migra" but about other topics—e.g., "migraine," "migratory birds," or an unrelated acronym "MIGRA"—should be excluded. Edge cases include short or ambiguous mentions (a lone variable name "migra" without context), foreign-language uses or slang ("la migra" referring to immigration enforcement), and documents that list variable codes but lack substantive migration content; for those, check surrounding words like "migration," "migrants," "EU enlargement," "East," "West," or "survey" to confirm relevance.
21585	linksrechtsskala	variables	The user wants a clear explanation of the "left–right scale" used in political surveys — what it measures and how respondents, parties and politicians are asked to place themselves. They also need to know common implementations and coding (e.g., 0–10, 1–11 or 1–5 "thermometer" formats), plus how missing/"don't know" responses and wave-specific variations are handled.	A document is relevant if it contains survey questions, codebooks, or questionnaires that ask respondents to place themselves, parties, or politicians on a left–right political scale (e.g., self-placement items, party placement such as SPD/CDU/FDP/CSU/Greens, or politician ratings like Helmut Kohl or Oskar Lafontaine). Relevant documents typically show the exact scale format and wording (examples: 1–11 scales, 0–10 thermometers, 1–5 follow‑up thermometers, or two‑step left/middle/right plus intensity), response codes (e.g. 01..11, 98/99/00, KA/no answer) and variable labels (F35, F30, F31, FIV31, etc.) or wave-specific instructions. Non‑relevant texts are those that use the words “links” or “rechts” in other senses (hyperlinks, legal “rechts,” spatial directions) or general political commentary that does not include a measurement instrument or scale item. Edge cases include documents that merely mention left–right ideology without showing the response categories (lower relevance), translations or summaries of questionnaires (may be partially relevant), and telephone‑survey notes that omit visual thermometers or change coding across waves — these require careful inspection to confirm they capture the scale information sought.
21895	linksrechts	variables	Survey items asking respondents to place their own political views on a left–right scale (using lettered boxes or a 0–10 "thermometer") and to rate where various political parties fall on that same scale. It also asks respondents to assess how strong they perceive conflicts or interest differences to be between various social and political groups in Germany.	Relevant documents are those that clearly function as a political questionnaire or survey instrument using the German left/right framing—e.g., items that ask respondents to place themselves on a left–right scale, to rate parties on that same scale, or to rate group conflicts (the text’s repeated “links” and “rechts,” scale descriptors like 0–10, answer boxes/letters, and mode labels like CAWI/MAIL are strong signals). Include full question wording, response options, and instructions (such as “make a cross” or “name the letter below”) because these show the document’s purpose and allow mapping to the query. Non-relevant documents mention “left” and “right” in other senses (driving directions, anatomical terms, or web “links”), are opinion pieces that only refer to left/right metaphorically, or are fragments that lack any survey structure or scale. Edge cases include transcripts or reports that quote the questionnaire (still relevant) and heavily duplicated or HTML-tagged copies (the repeated br tags or repeats are noisy but still relevant if the survey content is present).
22951	medienkonsum	variables	The user wants an overview of "Medienkonsum" — how people use different media for entertainment and information, including types of media, usage patterns, effects, and practical guidance or recommendations for healthy media habits.	A document is relevant to the keyword "medienkonsum" if it discusses how people consume media — types of media (TV, internet, social media, radio), usage patterns, time spent, demographic differences, or effects of media on users. The supplied paragraph — repeatedly mentioning "the various means of entertainment and information" — is semantically related and could be relevant even though it does not explicitly use the word "medienkonsum"; however, the repeated lines and HTML-like breaks suggest low quality or noisy duplication. Non-relevant documents simply name media channels without addressing consumption (for example a technical spec for broadcasting equipment, site navigation menus, or marketing copy), or focus on media production/policy rather than user behavior. Edge cases include translated text or synonyms (e.g., "media use" or "usage patterns") which should be treated as relevant, whereas boilerplate repetitions, spam, or isolated phrases with no substantive content should be treated as non-relevant.
230	umweltbewusstsein	variables	The user wants a clear definition and overview of "umweltbewusstsein" (environmental awareness), including its significance for individuals and society. They may also be seeking examples, ways to foster eco-conscious behavior, and methods to measure or promote it.	A document is relevant to the keyword "umweltbewusstsein" if it explicitly discusses environmental awareness — for example definitions, surveys or statistics on public attitudes, educational programs, behavioral studies (recycling, low-carbon transport), awareness-raising campaigns, or policy measures intended to increase ecological consciousness, especially in German-language or Germany-focused contexts. Highly relevant documents include NGO reports on German citizens’ environmental attitudes, academic papers measuring "Umweltbewusstsein," school curricula on sustainability, and case studies of successful awareness campaigns. Documents are non-relevant if they merely mention the word in passing, use it as marketing jargon without evidence (e.g., a product labeled "umweltbewusst" with no substantiation), or if the text is about unrelated topics that happen to contain the word (company names, trademarks, or literal biological uses of "Umwelt" in ethology that do not address human environmental attitudes). Edge cases include English-language materials using the synonym "environmental awareness" (relevant if the user intends the same concept), articles reporting environmental outcomes (like emissions or recycling rates) that imply awareness without naming it (potentially relevant), and philosophical or scientific uses of "Umwelt" that require checking intent before deeming them relevant.
26823	technology	variables	Someone searching for "technology" here is likely looking for survey items or a way to measure public interest, awareness, and attitudes toward technology. They want to assess things like personal interest and informedness about science and tech, perceived regional leadership in ICT use, expected impacts of emerging technologies over the next 20 years, information sources, and the future role of space-derived technologies.	This document is relevant to the query "technology" because it repeatedly names technology-related topics (e.g., "A5 Technology," "science and technology," "information and communication technologies," "Internet," "mobile telephone," and "space derived technologies") and contains question items about interest, awareness, and perceived effects of new technologies. It is specifically a survey questionnaire, so it is especially useful if the query intent is about public attitudes, survey design, questionnaire items, or measuring interest in technology (for example, researchers looking for response scales like "1 Not at all" to "4 Very much"). It would be non-relevant for intents seeking technical explanations, implementation details, code, or product specifications — this text contains no technical descriptions or how-to guidance. Edge cases: noisy formatting and repeated prompt tokens (FW2, Present list, duplicated lines) may lower precision in retrieval but could help if the user wants examples of survey wording or repeated-item validation.
2817	populismus	variables	The user wants a clear, concise definition of "populism" and its distinguishing characteristics. They may also be looking for the different types (left/right), typical causes and rhetoric, and examples or political consequences to understand how the concept applies in practice.	A document is relevant to the keyword "populismus" if it explicitly defines or analyzes populism—its core features (anti-elitism, people-versus-elite rhetoric, charismatic leadership, simplistic policy promises), its varieties (right-wing, left-wing, nativist), or concrete case studies (e.g., analyses of parties or leaders in Germany, Austria, the US, or Latin America). Empirical research, historical overviews, comparative studies, media- and discourse-analyses, and articles that measure or operationalize populism (indices, survey evidence, rhetorical coding) are highly relevant because they provide substantive explanation and examples. A document that merely mentions the word in passing, uses it as a political insult without conceptual clarity, or discusses unrelated topics that happen to contain the substring "populismus" is not relevant. Edge cases include opinion pieces or satire that use populismus rhetorically (partly relevant if they illuminate public perception), documents in other languages where the concept is analyzed under different labels, and news reports about protests or policies that imply populist dynamics but do not explicate them (these are partially relevant depending on depth).
28676	worklife	variables	A user searching "worklife" wants to assess how their job responsibilities affect their personal life, specifically measuring how often work duties interfere with private life (often/sometimes/rarely/never). This is part of a broader survey about impressions of everyday places and people.	A document is relevant to the keyword "worklife" when it explicitly addresses the relationship between work and private life — for example discussions of where people work, how job tasks or duties affect home life, commuting, working hours, or questions about work–life balance. The provided paragraph is highly relevant because it mentions "wo Sie ... arbeiten" (where you work) and directly asks how frequently professional duties impair private life, which ties squarely to worklife issues. A document is non-relevant if it only lists everyday locations or gives general survey instructions and Likert scales without any linkage to employment, job demands, or effects on personal life. Edge cases include texts that use the word "work" in other senses (e.g., "work of art," mechanical "working" devices), brief passing mentions of employment status without discussing impacts on private life, or multilingual repetitions and boilerplate that dilute the substantive work–life content.
317	homeoffice	variables	Seeks information and viewpoints about the debate on whether employees should have a legal right to work from home when the job allows it. Also asks whether and how it would be feasible for the respondent’s specific role to perform part of their work remotely.	A document is relevant to the keyword "homeoffice" when it directly discusses working from home — for example debates about a legal right to telework, employer policies, surveys asking whether jobs can be performed remotely, technical or occupational constraints, or case studies of hybrid work arrangements. Relevant examples include draft legislation on a statutory right to work from home, company telecommuting rules, employee questionnaires asking "Wäre es bei Ihrer Tätigkeit möglich, einen Teil der Arbeit von zuhause zu erledigen?", and analyses of which job tasks can or cannot be done remotely. Non-relevant documents mention "home office" only incidentally (e.g., ads for home office furniture, interior design posts), use the term in a different sense (the UK Home Office government department or a brand named HomeOffice), or discuss COVID-19 broadly without addressing entitlement, feasibility, or implementation. Edge cases include multilingual or poorly parsed texts where "br" or line breaks split survey questions, documents that only touch on remote work peripherally (partially relevant), and materials focused on technical infrastructure or occupational safety that are relevant only if they tie back to the question of allowing work from home.
32087	sexualität	variables	The user wants to know how the disclosure of Thomas Hitzlsperger’s homosexuality relates to active professional footballers, specifically asking about public and professional acceptance — would an active pro who is openly gay be supported, hired, or face discrimination.	A document is relevant to the query "sexualität" when it directly addresses sexual orientation, coming-out experiences, public discussions of sexuality (especially in sports), or policies and social attitudes toward LGBTQ+ athletes. For example, a news article about Thomas Hitzlsperger coming out, interviews with active professional footballers about being gay, club anti-discrimination policies, or surveys of fan reactions would be clearly relevant. Documents that focus narrowly on biological reproduction, clinical sexual health without linking to orientation, erotica, or unrelated uses of the word are not relevant. Borderline cases include historical treatments of sexuality in sport, language-other-than-German sources, and speculative gossip that attempts to out an active player — these may touch the topic but raise privacy and reliability concerns. Prefer authoritative, respectful sources that discuss acceptance, policy, or concrete examples of active athletes coming out; avoid materials that invade privacy or rely on rumors.
32820	selbstdarstellung	variables	The user is looking for a short written self-presentation ("Selbstdarstellung")—either a ready-made paragraph or guidance on how to write one—to introduce themselves for applications, profiles, or introductions. They need concise advice or an example that covers background, strengths, and goals in an appropriate tone and structure.	A document is relevant to the keyword "selbstdarstellung" when it centrally discusses self‑presentation—definitions, theories from psychology or communication studies, practical tips for crafting a personal profile (e.g., CV, LinkedIn, artist statement), or concrete examples of how people present themselves online and offline. Useful signals are the term appearing in headings, abstracts, or the first paragraphs, detailed case studies or templates, and comparisons to related concepts like "Selbstmarketing" or "Impression Management." A document is non‑relevant if the word appears only once in passing, if the page is primarily about an unrelated topic (for example a product named “Selbstdarstellung” with no explanatory content), or if the content is purely visual with no textual explanation. Edge cases include materials in other languages using the translation "self‑presentation" (which may still be relevant), academic papers that mention the term only in literature review, and artistic discussions where "Selbstdarstellung" refers specifically to genre conventions rather than practical self‑marketing—these may be relevant depending on whether the user seeks theoretical, practical, or creative perspectives.
33259	selbstwirksamkeit	variables	The user is looking for a clear definition and explanation of "Selbstwirksamkeit" (self-efficacy), including its psychological role in motivation and behavior change, how it’s measured, and practical ways to strengthen it.	A document is relevant to the keyword "selbstwirksamkeit" if it directly discusses the concept of self‑efficacy — for example defining Bandura’s theory, describing measurement tools like the General Self‑Efficacy Scale, reporting interventions to boost self‑efficacy in education, health or workplace settings, or giving concrete examples of self‑efficacy change. Relevant documents often include empirical studies, literature reviews, clinical or educational guides, and translated texts that explicitly equate "selbstwirksamkeit" with "self‑efficacy." Non‑relevant documents merely containing the word in a list or passing mention, focusing on different constructs (e.g., self‑esteem, confidence) without addressing efficacy beliefs, or using the term in an unrelated technical or legal sense should be treated as low relevance. Edge cases include German vs. English materials (a paper using only the English term "self‑efficacy" is still relevant), compound or inflected forms (selbstwirksamkeitserfahrung, selbstwirksamkeitsüberzeugung), and domain‑specific uses where a paper may be relevant only to a particular context (e.g., academic self‑efficacy) rather than to general theory. Assess relevance by checking whether the document provides conceptual explanation, empirical evidence, measurement details, or practical guidance about self‑efficacy rather than a brief or tangential mention.
33371	selbstverwirklichung	variables	The user wants to assess how important self-fulfillment/self-actualization (selbstverwirklichung) is to a person when considering their life goals, using a 1–7 importance scale. They need clear instructions or a concise definition so respondents can reliably rate the personal importance of self-realization.	A document is relevant to the keyword "selbstverwirklichung" if it explicitly addresses self-realization or closely related ideas such as personal goals, life aspirations, value priorities, or measures of psychological growth. The supplied paragraph is relevant because it directly asks respondents to reflect on "what you actually strive for in your life" and to rate the importance of those items on a 1–7 scale, which is a survey approach to assessing self-fulfillment. Other clearly relevant examples include psychological discussions (e.g., Maslow’s self-actualization), interviews or personal essays about achieving one’s potential, and validated scales or survey items that operationalize self-realization. Non-relevant documents are those that only mention the term in passing, use it as a brand or headline unrelated to meaning, or cover unrelated topics (technical manuals, recipes, legal notices); boilerplate survey templates that never list substantive life-goals are borderline relevant but less useful than items that actually probe specific aspirations. Edge cases include translations or metaphorical uses where the term appears but the content does not explore personal striving, which should be judged less relevant unless context shows a thematic focus on self-realization.
34932	rightwing	variables	The user wants a concise paragraph defining "rightwing" — a political label for conservative or reactionary positions that typically favor limited government, free-market economics, traditional social and cultural values, strong national defense, and law-and-order policies. They likely expect a clear summary of core beliefs and how right-wing views contrast with left-wing positions.	A document is relevant to the keyword "rightwing" if its primary focus is on right-wing politics or ideology—discussing conservative, nationalist, libertarian, or far‑right movements, party platforms, typical policy positions (e.g., immigration restriction, free‑market advocacy), historical development, or profiles of right‑wing leaders and organizations. Useful examples include analyses of a country's right‑wing party, academic papers comparing right‑wing policy trends, news reports about right‑wing rallies, or datasets showing voting patterns among right‑wing constituencies. Non‑relevant documents treat the term in a different sense (e.g., describing the right wing of a building or aircraft), use it only in passing without substantive content, are spam, or contain unrelated homographs or usernames that happen to include the word. Edge cases include phrases like "the right wing of the party" (which may be relevant if it discusses intra‑party ideology), differences in what counts as right‑wing across countries, and pieces that merely quote right‑wing rhetoric without analysis—these can be borderline relevant depending on depth and intent.
39506	sozialisation	variables	A request to report, on a given scale, how much religious education influenced one’s upbringing in the parental home — i.e., to quantify the role of religious socialization by the family. This information is needed to assess the strength of familial socialization in shaping religious values and practices.	A document is relevant to the keyword "sozialisation" if it explicitly addresses processes of socialization—especially family-centered topics such as how parental upbringing and religious education shaped a person—like the survey prompt "Bitte sagen Sie mir anhand dieser Skala jetzt welche Rolle in Ihrem Elternhaus die religiöse Erziehung gespielt hat." Relevant examples include questionnaire items, interview transcripts about parental influence, sociological studies of religious socialization, and codebooks reporting Likert-scale answers. Non-relevant documents include uses of similar words in other senses (e.g., workplace onboarding, animal socialization), pages that only contain the keyword without substantive content, or completely unrelated topics such as product descriptions or news articles. Edge cases include texts that mention "religiöse Erziehung" but treat it theologically rather than as a socialization process, translations or survey templates that include the phrase but lack empirical data, and documents with HTML artifacts (like "br" or "Answer:") that signal a scraped or partially formatted questionnaire—these may be partially relevant depending on whether they preserve the socialization context.
4027	migrationshintergrund	variables	The user wants a clear definition and explanation of the German term "Migrationshintergrund" — who is counted as having a migration background, how the term is used in official statistics, forms, and law, and what social or administrative implications it carries. They may also be seeking criteria, examples, or guidance on how to report this status on documents.	A document is relevant to the keyword "migrationshintergrund" if it treats that term as the demographic or legal concept used in German-speaking contexts — for example studies, reports or policies that analyze people "mit Migrationshintergrund" or provide census and school statistics by migration background. Relevant examples include government or NGO reports on integration, academic articles about educational outcomes by migration background, public-health research stratified by Migrationshintergrund, and policy briefs on anti-discrimination measures. Documents are non-relevant when the word appears only incidentally or in an unrelated sense, such as software/database migration logs, travelogues, genealogical migration histories, or when it is merely part of a filename or metadata with no substantive discussion. Edge cases include texts in other languages that discuss the same concept (those are relevant if they clearly map to the German category), short tables that list counts without explanation (borderline relevance), and personal anecdotes about individual immigrants (relevant only if they connect to the broader category or analysis).
43698	covid19	variables	A user querying "covid19" is seeking basic and up-to-date information about the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2—its symptoms, transmission, testing, treatment, vaccines, and prevention measures. They may also want current case trends, variant information, and relevant public‑health or travel guidance.	A document is relevant to the keyword "covid19" if it directly addresses SARS‑CoV‑2 or the COVID‑19 pandemic — for example discussions of symptoms, transmission, testing, vaccines, treatments, public‑health guidance, case counts, or variant surveillance. Highly relevant examples include CDC or WHO guidance, peer‑reviewed studies on vaccine efficacy, official local restriction updates, and datasets of confirmed cases; by contrast, social media rumors, opinion pieces without evidence, or documents that merely mention COVID‑19 in passing are less relevant. Non‑relevant documents include unrelated materials that include the string "covid19" in a filename, references, or metadata but whose main topic is different, or content about other respiratory diseases without clear connection to SARS‑CoV‑2. Edge cases depend on user intent and timeliness: early‑pandemic guidance may be historically relevant but clinically outdated, and modeling or preprint studies may be important for research queries yet unsuitable for medical advice. Finally, relevance also depends on synonyms and language (e.g., "coronavirus," "SARS‑CoV‑2") and source credibility — authoritative, recent sources should be prioritized for health or policy queries.
5030	sicherheitsgefühl	variables	A search for "sicherheitsgefühl" seeks a clear explanation of the subjective sense of safety—what it means, how it differs from objective risk, and the personal, social, and environmental factors that shape it. The user may also want ways to measure or strengthen that feeling and to understand its effects on behaviour and well‑being.	A document is relevant to the keyword "sicherheitsgefühl" when it explicitly discusses the subjective feeling or perception of safety—for example studies, interviews, surveys, or policy analyses about how people feel in their homes, neighborhoods, workplaces, or on public transport. Relevant material can include research on psychological factors, environmental design (lighting, visibility, urban planning), community measures (neighbourhood watches, policing strategies) or evaluations of interventions that aim to improve perceived safety. Documents that only report objective crime statistics without linking them to residents' perceptions, or that treat "Sicherheit" solely as technical or legal security (e.g., cybersecurity protocols or safety regulations) are generally not relevant unless they address the emotional or perceptual dimension. Edge cases include articles about physical security measures (CCTV, locks) which are relevant if they explore their impact on people’s sense of security, and translated or synonym-using texts (e.g., "sense of safety") which are relevant if the connection to subjective perception is clear. Non-relevant items can also be brand names, product pages, or incidental mentions where the term appears but the document does not examine feelings of safety.
50581	digitalisierung	variables	The user wants a concise paragraph that defines "Digitalisierung" (digitalization) and summarizes its significance, main effects, and typical applications (e.g., in business, public services, and daily life). They likely need a clear, ready-to-use text for an essay, report, or presentation.	A document is relevant to the keyword "digitalisierung" if it directly addresses digitalization as a process—covering strategies, technologies, policy, case studies, implementation steps, or measurable outcomes (for example, papers on e‑government rollout, Industry 4.0 adoption, cloud migrations, or workforce digital‑skill programs). Relevant texts typically use related terminology (IoT, AI, digital transformation, digitization strategy), give concrete examples or metrics, and explain challenges and solutions. Non‑relevant documents merely mention the word in passing, use it in an unrelated sense (e.g., simple file scanning labeled “digitization”), are generic marketing spam, or focus on tangential topics without substantive discussion. Edge cases include language/term differences (German "Digitalisierung" vs English "digitization"), sector‑specific reports that may be relevant only to particular industries, and older sources whose guidance may be outdated; a brief mention or a translated hit may be useful depending on user intent but often isn’t sufficient. Signals of high relevance are in‑depth coverage, clear methods or case studies, up‑to‑date dates, and matching language/region.
5065	sicherheitsempfinden	variables	The user wants to describe or assess their personal sense of safety ("Sicherheitsempfinden") in public places—whether they generally feel safe or unsafe. They may also be seeking to identify circumstances or factors (time, location, crowding, lighting, etc.) that influence that feeling.	A document is relevant if it focuses on people's subjective sense of safety in public places, for example survey questions or interview responses asking “Do you generally feel safe at public places?” or analyses of how perceptions vary by time of day, lighting, crowding, police presence, gender or age. Useful documents will describe measurement methods (Likert-scale questions, open-ended personal accounts, neighborhood safety indexes) or give concrete examples like “I don’t feel safe in poorly lit parks at night.” Non-relevant documents discuss unrelated kinds of security (cybersecurity, physical locks, workplace health-and-safety rules) or only present raw crime statistics without linking them to perceived safety. Edge cases include materials that use only the word “Sicherheit” (safety) without addressing “empfinden” (feeling) — these may be partially relevant if they discuss public safety conditions — and short or truncated German phrases; texts in German that mirror the question are especially pertinent, while translations and broader mental-health discussions are relevant only when tied to feeling safe in public spaces.
52781	alkoholkonsum	variables	The user is looking for survey question wording and response categories to measure alcohol consumption frequency (e.g., past 12 months and past month), including typical answer ranges like "never", numeric frequency bands (1–5, 6–11, etc.), weekly/monthly/daily categories, and associated skip/branching instructions.	A document is relevant to the keyword "alkoholkonsum" if it contains questionnaire items or response categories that measure alcohol consumption frequency or recency (e.g., “How often have you drunk alcohol in the last year/month/last 12 months”), including the specific response scales (Never; 1–5 times; approximately once a month; 1–2 times, 3–5 times, …, more than 20 times). Concrete indicators of relevance include survey instructions and skip logic tied to consumption codes (for example “if code 13 continue with 55” or “if yes to monthly code 4 continue with 13b”), labels like FW2/F13/F62, and atypical response options such as “yes but only one gulp.” Partial matches (frequency mentioned without a clear timeframe, or general references to drinking behavior) are somewhat relevant but weaker, while documents that discuss alcohol-related diagnoses, policy, or biomarkers without frequency questions are only tangentially relevant. Non-relevant documents are those focusing on other substances, unrelated health topics, or purely administrative text with no consumption items. Edge cases to watch for include linguistic variations (“consumed,” “had a drink,” German phrasing), duplicate or slightly different scales across forms, and very low-frequency categories that may be coded differently across surveys.
53827	berufsabschluss	variables	The user needs to understand or answer whether they hold a "Berufsabschluss" — i.e., a completed vocational training qualification or an academic degree — typically to complete a form or verify eligibility for a job, benefit, or application.	A document is highly relevant to the keyword "berufsabschluss" if it explicitly asks about or describes a completed vocational qualification or academic degree — for example a job application form, CV, certificate recognition form, or guidance on proving a completed apprenticeship or study program. The repeated question "Haben Sie eine abgeschlossene Berufsausbildung oder ein abgeschlossenes Studium" in the paragraph is a direct match and signals a questionnaire or form field, so such a document would be judged very relevant. Borderline or partial relevance occurs when synonyms or variants are used (Ausbildung, Abschluss, Qualifikation) or when the text discusses having no Berufsabschluss ("ohne Berufsabschluss"); these are still pertinent but may require stemming or semantic matching. Non-relevant documents mention similar words in different senses (e.g., a general "Abschluss" meaning a thesis defense, content about ending a career, or OCR/misspellings like "berufsabsschluss") or only contain the term incidentally without substantive information about vocational credentials.
54808	berufsprestige	variables	The user wants a concise definition and explanation of "Berufsprestige" (occupational prestige), including how professions are ranked and which factors (income, education, social respect, measurement methods like surveys or prestige scales) determine those rankings. They may also be looking for example rankings or the term's relevance in sociology and labor research.	A document is relevant to the keyword "berufsprestige" if it contains a paragraph that defines or discusses occupational prestige, explains how it is measured (for example SIOPS, Treiman’s scale, or survey-based rankings), or gives concrete examples or lists of professions ranked by social status. Relevant documents will also analyze causes and consequences of berufsprestige—such as education, income, or cultural values—or present empirical results from surveys or cross‑country comparisons. Non‑relevant documents merely mentioning the word in passing, using "prestige" in a non‑occupational sense (brand prestige, product names), or containing only metadata, isolated tables, or code without explanatory text should be excluded. Edge cases include multilingual works where "berufsprestige" appears only in a bibliography or a translated term in an otherwise English discussion (potentially useful), and historical or marketing uses that resemble the concept but do not address its sociological meaning (likely not useful). In a German query context, German‑language paragraphs are preferable, but rigorous English analyses explicitly about occupational prestige are also relevant.
55226	arbeitsbelastung	variables	The user is looking for a short paragraph about "Arbeitsbelastung" (workload/occupational stress). They likely want a concise explanation defining the term and summarizing common causes, effects, and/or strategies to manage it, suitable for a report or assignment.	A document is relevant to the keyword "arbeitsbelastung" when it addresses workload or occupational strain directly—discussing causes, measurements, health effects, legal duties, or interventions for work-related stress (for example a study measuring nurses’ workload, a company risk assessment, or guidance under Arbeitsschutzgesetz). Highly relevant texts include empirical papers with measurements or questionnaires (COPSOQ, surveys, physiological metrics), workplace case studies, occupational health guidance, or legal/regulatory discussions that explicitly use the term or close synonyms like "Belastung am Arbeitsplatz" or "Überlastung." Non-relevant documents merely containing the word once in passing, advertising copy that mentions workload without substantive content, or papers using "Arbeit" in the physics sense (work/energy) or discussing CPU/server load are not relevant to human occupational workload. Edge cases arise when the domain is ambiguous (IT/system "workload" vs. human "Arbeitsbelastung"), when only translations or metadata include the term, or when related topics such as "Arbeitszeit" or general stress are discussed without linking to work-specific burden—these require checking context to decide relevance. Practical signals of strong relevance are explicit populations, methods, outcomes, statistics, or intervention descriptions; weak signals are single-word occurrences, unrelated domains, or mere bibliographic mentions.
56202	arbeitsbelastungen	variables	Looking for information on "arbeitsbelastungen" (workload/occupational strain): what types and causes exist, how they affect physical and mental health, and how to assess and manage or reduce them in the workplace.	A document is relevant to the keyword "arbeitsbelastungen" if it directly addresses workplace burdens or workloads—describing types (physical, mental, emotional), causes (long hours, understaffing, high tempo, role conflict), measurements (surveys, questionnaires, COPSOQ), consequences (stress, burnout, absenteeism) or mitigation strategies (ergonomics, job redesign, legal protections). Relevant examples include German-language occupational health reports, company risk assessments mentioning "Arbeitsbelastungen," research papers comparing workload across professions, or guides for works councils on reducing job strain. A document is non-relevant if the term appears only in passing, is used in a different sense (e.g., structural engineering loads, financial burdens unrelated to work), or if it treats unrelated populations without workplace context (e.g., student homework load only). Edge cases include materials about unpaid care work or home-office stress—these can be relevant if framed as "work" or occupational burden—and translations or singular/plural variants ("Arbeitsbelastung"/"arbeitsbelastungen") should be treated as matching the same topic.
5736	wohlfahrtsstaat	variables	The user is seeking to measure attitudes toward the welfare state in Germany by presenting a list of statements about social inequalities and the role of state and economy; for each statement they want respondents to indicate one of four agreement levels (fully agree, rather agree, rather disagree, or completely disagree).	A document is relevant to the keyword "wohlfahrtsstaat" when it directly discusses the welfare state, social inequality, or the role of the state in providing social protection — for example policy analyses, descriptions of social transfers, or surveys of public attitudes toward social spending. The provided paragraph repeatedly asks respondents about "Staat und Wirtschaft" and "soziale Unterschiede," so it is relevant insofar as it gathers opinions tied to welfare‑state issues, but it contains little substantive analysis or concrete policy content. A non‑relevant document would only mention the word in passing, be unrelated (e.g., technical manuals, ads), or consist mainly of boilerplate repetition and spam that add no topical information. Edge cases include texts that treat "wohlfahrtsstaat" historically or comparatively (partially relevant) or questionnaires and survey prompts like this one (relevant for public opinion research but lower value for policy detail). Overall, this paragraph is topically on‑target but of limited usefulness without the actual statements or responses.
60378	führungsstil	variables	The searcher wants a clear explanation of "Führungsstil" (leadership style), including its definition and common types with their key characteristics and effects on teams. They may also be seeking practical guidance on how to identify, compare, or develop an effective leadership style for a given context.	A document is relevant to the keyword "führungsstil" when it directly discusses leadership styles—definitions, typologies (e.g., authoritarian, democratic, laissez-faire, transformational), measurement tools, effects on team performance, or case studies in management contexts. For example, a German study comparing transformational and transactional Führungsstil in Mittelstand firms or a training manual describing how to adopt a participative Führungsstil would be highly relevant. Documents are non-relevant if they only mention the word in passing, use it as a metadata tag with no substantive content, or cover unrelated topics that happen to contain similar text (e.g., "Führerschein" or stylistic design guides). Edge cases include domain-specific treatments (military, nursing, software teams) that are relevant but narrow in scope, translations or documents in English that use "leadership style" instead of the German word, and OCR/typo variants like "fuhrungsstil"—these may be relevant but require normalization or user-intent clarification. Lastly, opportunistic content such as marketing blurbs or personality-quiz pages that superficially reference Führungsstil may be less useful for research despite matching the keyword.
6213	religionszugehörigkeit	variables	The user is looking for standard survey wording and response categories for "religionszugehörigkeit" (religious affiliation), e.g., options like Catholic, Evangelical/Protestant, other, and none, often reported as percentages of the population. The underlying goal is to collect comparable data on respondents' religious denomination for analysis or presentation.	A document is relevant to the query "religionszugehörigkeit" if it discusses religious affiliation directly — for example survey items, census tables, or questionnaires that list response categories like Catholic, Evangelical/Protestant, Other, or None, or that report percentages of the population by religion. Items such as interview instructions, codebooks with numeric response options (1 = Catholic, 2 = Evangelical, 3 = Other, 4 = None), or questions about preferring to live in a predominantly Catholic or Protestant village are clearly relevant because they capture denominational belonging. Documents that are not relevant include theological essays, descriptions of religious rituals, institutional histories, or organizational mission statements that do not address individual affiliation or demographic coding. Borderline cases include texts that mention "religion" only as an explanatory factor (e.g., church tax laws) or that discuss belief/practice rather than formal affiliation — these can be partially relevant depending on whether they treat membership categories (Konfession, Religionsgemeinschaft) or only attitudes. Also consider language and form variations: German synonyms (Konfession, Religionsgemeinschaft) and translated questionnaires or scanned forms are relevant, though scanned images may require OCR to extract the affiliation data.
6346	worklifebalance	variables	The user wants to know which policy or workplace measures would be most effective in helping Europeans reconcile private and working lives—given that about 45% of the labour market are women. They are seeking a recommendation or ranking of options (e.g., flexible hours, parental leave, affordable childcare, telework) that best support work–life balance.	A document is relevant to the query "worklifebalance" if it directly discusses measures that help people reconcile private and working lives in a European context — for example policies on parental leave, affordable childcare, flexible working hours, teleworking, care services, and gender-equal labour market measures — and backs claims with data or evaluations. Policy briefs, EU survey results, comparative country case studies, and program evaluations (e.g., showing how paid parental leave increased women's labour force participation from X% to Y%) are clear examples of relevant sources. Documents that are not relevant include those that only use the phrase superficially, discuss unrelated kinds of "balance" (financial balance sheets, fitness advice), or describe corporate perks without linking them to measurable reconciliation outcomes. Edge cases include pieces that cite the statistic in the paragraph (e.g., "45% of people in the labour market are women") but offer no policy analysis, outdated or non‑EU data that may not generalize, or materials focused on a single niche group (such as managers only) where conclusions won’t apply broadly.
6501	homosexualität	variables	The user wants information about homosexuality in professional football, specifically how active players who come out are perceived and whether they would receive acceptance and support from teammates, fans, and institutions. They are asking about current attitudes, prevalence of openly gay active players, and examples or evidence of support or discrimination.	A document is relevant to the keyword "homosexualität" if it directly treats homosexuality as its subject—e.g., news reports or interviews about Thomas Hitzlsperger coming out, pieces on whether active professional footballers can or do come out, public reaction, anti-discrimination policies, or social-science research on attitudes toward gay athletes. Concrete examples of relevant documents include a German-language press article quoting Hitzlsperger, an interview with an active player about coming out, or an opinion piece on acceptance in football. Non-relevant documents merely containing the word in passing (for example a match report that briefly mentions a player's sexual orientation without discussion), using a different meaning, or unrelated pages (spam, unrelated biographies) should be excluded. Edge cases include content about homosexual behavior in animals or legal definitions of homosexuality—which may be tangentially relevant depending on user intent—as well as ambiguous mentions, translation errors, or private-person speculation that raise privacy and sensitivity concerns.
6534	kriminalitätsfurcht	variables	The user wants to know whether there are any areas — especially within about one kilometer or elsewhere in their town/municipality — that people consider unsafe to walk alone at night. This information measures personal fear of crime and the perceived spatial distribution of neighbourhood safety.	A document is relevant to the keyword "kriminalitätsfurcht" (fear of crime) if it addresses people's perceptions of safety—especially references to not wanting to walk alone at night, descriptions of specific local areas or neighborhoods within a short distance (e.g., within one kilometer), survey questions or interview transcripts asking about such avoidance, or first‑hand reports like “I avoid the park after dark.” The repeated paragraph here clearly contains a survey/interview prompt about local night‑time avoidance, so any document containing that text would be highly relevant as it directly measures fear of crime in the immediate vicinity. Documents that only give raw crime statistics, legal definitions, or policy descriptions without linking them to residents’ perceived safety are generally non‑relevant, because they do not capture the subjective fear the query targets. Borderline cases include materials about crime prevention or policing that imply changes in fear (relevant if they report residents’ reactions) and noisy transcripts or repeated lines (like this paragraph) which are still relevant if they reflect the original survey wording or respondent answers.
6763	psychotherapie	variables	The user wants a clear, concise explanation of psychotherapy—what it is, how it works, and when it’s used—plus basic information about common approaches (e.g., CBT, psychodynamic), expected outcomes, and how to find or access a therapist.	A document is relevant to the keyword "psychotherapie" if its main topic is psychotherapy—definitions, treatment methods (CBT, psychodynamic, humanistic, etc.), clinical evidence, indications, provider qualifications, access and insurance issues, or practical guidance for patients and clinicians. Highly relevant examples include clinical guidelines on psychotherapy for depression, research studies on therapeutic effectiveness, directories of licensed psychotherapists, and patient information pages explaining what psychotherapy entails. Non-relevant documents mention the word only peripherally (e.g., a news article that fleetingly references psychotherapy), focus on unrelated "therapy" topics (physical therapy, machine learning "therapy" metaphors), or use the term in a purely bibliographic list with no substantive content. Edge cases include pages about psychotherapy training, regulation, or accreditation (potentially relevant depending on intent), documents in other languages that nevertheless use the exact term "psychotherapie" (more relevant than generic translations), and compound or specialized terms (e.g., "Kunsttherapie" or "Psychotherapieforschung") which may be partially relevant depending on whether the user seeks general psychotherapy information or a specific subtopic.
7939	psychologie	variables	The user is looking for a concise overview of "psychology" — what it studies (mind and behavior), its major subfields (e.g., clinical, cognitive, developmental, social), common research methods, and practical applications such as therapy, assessment, and career paths.	A document is relevant to the keyword "psychologie" if its main content directly discusses psychology topics — for example papers on cognitive processes, clinical therapy methods, developmental stages, psychological research findings, or program descriptions for a "psychologie" degree. Relevance is stronger when the term appears in headings, abstracts, or detailed sections rather than just a passing mention; an academic article about cognitive biases or a mental-health blog post that explains therapy techniques are clearly relevant. Non-relevant documents merely containing the word (e.g., a company name, an unrelated news story that quotes "psychologie" once, or an SEO page repeating the term without substantive content) should be excluded. Edge cases include multilingual pages where "psychologie" appears but most content is in another language, interdisciplinary works (e.g., social neuroscience) that partially focus on psychology, and course listings that name "psychologie" but provide no description — these can be borderline and require judging whether the psychological content is substantive.
810	bildungsgrad	variables	The searcher wants a clear definition of the German term "Bildungsgrad" — the level or degree of formal education someone has attained. They likely seek how it’s classified or measured (e.g., school leaving certificates, vocational training, university degrees) for surveys, statistics, or personal profiles.	A document is relevant to the keyword "bildungsgrad" if it explicitly addresses educational attainment or "education level" — for example census tables, survey reports, academic papers, or datasets that define and report categories such as "no formal education", "primary", "secondary", or "tertiary." Relevant items will explain how the bildungsgrad is measured (question wording, age cutoffs, ISCED mapping), give breakdowns by demographics (age, region, income), or use the term in a German-language policy or research context. Non-relevant documents merely mentioning the word in passing, using "degree" in a non-educational sense (e.g., mathematical degree or temperature degree), or focusing on unrelated aspects of "Bildung" without classifying levels would not be useful. Edge cases include English-language sources that never use the German term but fully cover "education level" (these are relevant), and historical texts that use obsolete educational categories or inconsistent mappings — they may be relevant but require careful interpretation.
828	nachhaltigkeit	variables	A user searching "Nachhaltigkeit" is likely looking for a clear definition and overview of sustainability, including its environmental, social, and economic dimensions. They may also want practical strategies, examples, metrics, or policies for implementing and measuring sustainable practices at personal, organizational, or societal levels.	A document is relevant to the query "nachhaltigkeit" if it directly addresses sustainability — for example discussions of environmental, social, or economic sustainability, corporate sustainability reports, lifecycle assessments, policy papers, or case studies of sustainable practices in energy, agriculture, or supply chains. Documents that only mention the word in passing (e.g., a single sentence in a long unrelated article), use it as a marketing buzzword without evidence, or treat it metaphorically are less relevant because they do not provide substantive information on the topic. Language and terminology matter: German-language content containing “Nachhaltigkeit” is an obvious match, but English texts using “sustainability” or domain-specific terms (e.g., circular economy, ESG, carbon footprint) are also relevant; misspellings, OCR errors, or translations can create edge cases where relevant material might be missed. Authority and timeliness affect relevance too — recent research, government guidelines, and NGO reports are typically more useful than outdated blog posts or product listings — while pages where the term only appears in metadata, comments, or unrelated contexts (homophones, names) should be treated as non-relevant.
928	corona	variables	Wanting an overview of public attitudes and impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in Germany — how people perceive infection risks, government measures and restrictions, and their effects on health, finances, schools, healthcare capacity, masks and tracing apps, travel/borders, protests, EU and rescue packages, and willingness to vaccinate.	This document is relevant to the keyword "corona" because it explicitly discusses the coronavirus pandemic using direct terms and German compounds (e.g., Corona, Coronavirus, CoronaKrise, CoronaMaßnahmen) and covers many core topics such as infections, public-health measures (masks, apps, lockdowns), vaccination, schools, economic relief, and regional policy responses. Concrete signals of high relevance include named events and actors (Trump infected, Tönnies outbreak), specific policies (mask mandates, contact‑tracing app), and temporal markers (week numbers) that show it is focused on COVID‑19 developments. It would be non‑relevant if the same token "corona" appears with a different meaning (solar corona, Corona beer, the Ford Corona automobile, corona discharge in physics, or a person’s surname) or only as an incidental string in unrelated content. Edge cases include partially relevant documents that discuss economic or political effects without explicit reference to the virus (these are somewhat relevant), concatenated German compounds or misspellings (e.g., CoronaKrise, CoronaMaßnahmen) which should be treated as matches, and materials that mention COVID topics but are fictional, satirical, or conspiratorial, which may be lower quality despite keyword overlap.
9616	politikverdrossenheit	variables	The user wants a concise paragraph explaining the German term "Politikverdrossenheit" (political disillusionment or apathy), including what it means, common causes, and its effects on civic participation. They likely need a short explanatory text suitable for an essay, article, or assignment.	Documents are relevant to the query "politikverdrossenheit" when they directly address political disaffection or apathy—explaining causes (e.g., corruption scandals, broken campaign promises, or economic inequality), describing manifestations (declining trust in parties, protest voting, youth disengagement, or falling turnout), or presenting measurements such as surveys and longitudinal studies. Relevant examples include empirical research on voter trust, news reports of a spike in non-voting after a scandal, policy analyses proposing re-engagement strategies, and comparative studies of political cynicism in Germany and other countries. Documents are not relevant when they only use the word in passing, focus on unrelated political topics (e.g., policy details without discussing attitudes), are purely promotional or spam, or treat "politics" in a generic sense without linking to disillusionment or participation. Edge cases include articles on low turnout that are relevant only if they connect turnout to attitudes; historical accounts are relevant if they trace causes or trends in disenchantment; and pieces using synonyms like "political apathy" or translations are relevant provided the conceptual link is clear.
14255	konsum	instruments_tools	The user seeks a concise explanation of consumer ethnocentrism — the belief that domestic products are superior to foreign ones — and how it is measured (the 15‑item short and 20‑item long CETSCALE). They want the theoretical background (Jacoby 1978) and the kinds of economic, social and moral beliefs the scale captures, such as the idea that buying foreign goods harms the domestic economy and increases unemployment.	This document is relevant to the query "konsum" because it directly describes consumers' beliefs about buying domestic versus foreign products and presents a 15- or 20-item scale measuring consumer ethnocentrism — a core aspect of consumption behavior. It is useful when the interest is in consumer attitudes, measurement instruments, references (e.g., Jacoby 1978), and how economic, social, and moral considerations shape purchase decisions (for example, shoppers who avoid imports to protect local jobs). It would be non-relevant if the query intends a different sense of "konsum" (such as medical drug consumption, substance use, or macro-level production statistics) or if a document only mentions the term without discussing consumer behavior. Borderline cases include papers on nationalism or trade policy that touch on consumer ethnocentrism (partially relevant) and highly technical psychometric reports that describe the scale structure but provide no context about actual purchasing behavior (less relevant).
15640	karriere	instruments_tools	The user is looking for information about a career-related questionnaire that measures three domains—career orientation, performance- and success-promoting work attitudes, and fear of failure—and wants to understand that its items are phrased to capture respondents' self-perceived, performance-related attitudes and behaviors.	A document is relevant to the keyword "karriere" if it deals with career orientation, career-related attitudes or measures—especially questionnaires and psychometric items that capture self-perceived, performance-related behaviors and fears (for example studies validating a career-orientation scale or vocational counseling instruments that assess fear of failure). Relevant examples include research on career orientation, instruments measuring success‑oriented work attitudes, and surveys that ask respondents to reflect on their career‑related behaviors and anxieties. Documents are non-relevant if they only use "karriere" in passing, discuss unrelated topics (e.g., product career metaphors, purely technical performance metrics), or focus on general personality constructs without any career context. Edge cases include papers that address fear of failure or work attitudes but not explicitly in a career context (partially relevant), documents in other languages or using synonyms like "Beruf" or "career" which should be matched by translation, and psychometric studies that are relevant only if their items explicitly target career constructs rather than broad self‑esteem.
1670	rassismus	instruments_tools	A person searching "rassismus" here likely wants to know how negative and positive attitudes toward outgroups are conceptualized and measured — specifically the distinction that they form independent continua and the existence of a German Allophilie scale (five subdimensions: affection, comfort, kinship, engagement, enthusiasm) and a Law-and-Order scale for xenophobic, state-control attitudes. They may also be seeking information on these scales' development (based on Pittinsky et al. and Fend) and their validation evidence (construct, convergent/discriminant, and criterion validity).	This document is relevant to the query "rassismus" because it describes validated instruments that measure attitudes toward outgroups—both positive (Allophilia: affection, comfort, kinship, engagement, enthusiasm) and negative (Law-and-Order: rejection of the foreign and support for coercive state measures)—which are central constructs in research on racism and xenophobia. It gives concrete details (scale structure, three items per subscale, validation with persons from foreign cultures) that make it useful for someone seeking measurement tools or empirical studies of prejudice. It may be less relevant if the searcher is looking for legal definitions, historical accounts, hate-crime case reports, or analyses of structural/institutional racism, because the paragraph focuses on psychological scales and attitudes rather than policy or lived incidents. An important edge case: Allophilia captures positive feelings toward outgroups and can miss subtle or covert racism, while the Law-and-Order scale targets authoritarian anti-foreigner tendencies—so researchers should consider adapting the scales if they need race-specific, systemic, or behavioral measures.
17057	kinderbetreuung	instruments_tools	The user is looking for information about childcare ("kinderbetreuung") — what types of care are available, how to find and enroll children, typical hours and age groups, costs, and any subsidies or regulations. Their goal is to choose and arrange appropriate, reliable care for a child.	Documents are relevant to the query "kinderbetreuung" when they directly address childcare: descriptions of daycare, kindergarten and after‑school programs; how to apply; opening hours; costs and subsidies; staff qualifications; legal definitions and local regulations. Highly relevant examples include municipal lists of childcare providers, application forms for a Kita place, fee schedules, eligibility rules for subsidies, or official guidance on child-to-staff ratios. Non-relevant documents either do not meaningfully discuss childcare (e.g., a passing mention of the word), cover unrelated topics that happen to include the term, or use the word in a different sense (such as a fictional title or an unrelated compound). Edge cases include materials where "kinderbetreuung" appears only in metadata or images (OCR may be needed), academic papers on early childhood theory that lack practical service information (partly relevant), or documents from other countries whose systems differ but still offer useful comparisons. Also consider language and recency: German-language, up‑to‑date local or legal information will usually be more useful than outdated or purely historical references.
17717	kinderwunsch	instruments_tools	The user wants information on "kinderwunsch"—people’s fertility intentions and desired number of children—and how family-related norms and attitudes (e.g., views on fathers’ parental leave, parental employment, and concepts of family and partnership) influence those intentions in Germany. They may also seek how these attitudes are measured in surveys (questions about actual and ideal number of children) and tested using cognitive interviews, as in the BiB pretest.	A document is relevant to the keyword "kinderwunsch" when it explicitly addresses fertility intentions or desired family size (terms like "gewünschte Kinderzahl," "ideale Kinderzahl," or "fertility intentions") or when it reports survey questions that measure people’s desire to have children. The paragraph is relevant because it explicitly mentions the desired and ideal number of children and tests attitude questions about parenting and parental leave using personally conducted cognitive interviews, which directly measure Kinderwunsch-related attitudes. Documents that analyze how family ideals, employment, or parental-leave policies influence the wish to have children are also highly relevant because they connect contextual factors to childbearing intentions. Edge cases include materials that only report fertility rates or demographic counts without assessing individual desires (partially relevant), papers focused on assisted reproductive technologies or clinical infertility care that use "Kinderwunsch" in a medical sense (potentially irrelevant to sociological intent), or discussions of family policy that never link to people’s childbearing intentions (less relevant).
19136	migra	instruments_tools	The user is looking for methods and tools to identify and measure migration background and related constructs (acculturation, ethnic/national identity, cross‑cultural loss, attitudes toward asylum seekers) in German research. Specifically they need information on survey items, validated scales and translations, psychometric properties, and practical implementation (e.g., SAS/SPSS/Stata code, Mikrozensus Scientific Use Files) for analysis.	A document is relevant to the keyword "migra" when it substantively discusses migration or migrants — for example items about "Migrationshintergrund," immigration and integration surveys (Mikrozensus, RESPOND), acculturation and identity scales, asylum-seeker questionnaires, or psychometric instruments and codebooks (SAS/SPSS/Stata) used to typify migration background. Strong signals of relevance include detailed methodology, questionnaire items, sample languages (e.g. Arabic, Farsi, Russian), validation statistics, or explicit focus on immigrant populations, whereas a single passing use of the word "migration" or a brief metadata tag is weak evidence. Non-relevant documents include cases where "migra" appears only as part of an unrelated word (e.g. "migraine"), a brand name, an unrelated acronym (MIGRA), or discussions of biological/animal migration with no human migration context. Edge cases to watch for are multilingual uses like Spanish "la migra" (immigration enforcement), internal versus international migration distinctions, or very short mentions that require more context — in those cases require additional topical content before labeling the document relevant.
21585	linksrechtsskala	instruments_tools	User wants a concise explanation of the "left–right scale" (Links-Rechts-Skala) as used in the PAWCER pretests: what it measures, how it is operationalized, and how it was tested. Specifically, they need to know that the scale maps respondents' ideological profiles across four subdimensions (economic libertarianism, conservatism, socialism, liberalism) by assigning scores to each dimension to enable individual and group comparisons, and that these questions were evaluated using face-to-face cognitive interviews.	A document is relevant to the query "linksrechtsskala" when it explicitly treats the Left–Right scale as an instrument — describing its operationalization, scoring and use (for example the four subdimensions: economic libertarianism, conservatism, socialism and liberalism), its application in cross‑national surveys such as PAWCER or the Values in Crisis study, or the pretest methods used (e.g. cognitive interviews, personally administered interviews). Concrete implementation details (question wording, subdimension items, scoring rules, translations or country versions) and empirical uses (comparisons of ideological profiles, links to welfare or climate attitudes) make a document especially relevant. Documents are non‑relevant if they only mention "left" or "right" rhetorically, treat left/right in nonpolitical senses (traffic, anatomy), or report a simple single‑item self‑placement without engaging the multidimensional LinksRechtsSkala or its measurement properties. Borderline cases include related two‑axis instruments (like the Political Compass) or theoretical discussions of ideology: these are partially relevant when they map economic and sociocultural dimensions or compare measurement approaches, but less so if they never address the specific subdimension structure or survey implementation.
21895	linksrechts	instruments_tools	The user is looking for information about the "left–right" political orientation question (Links–Rechts-Skala) used in the PAWCER project pretests—how the question was worded and evaluated. They likely want details on how this item (tested via face-to-face cognitive interviews) performed alongside questions on income differences and redistribution for cross‑national comparisons of welfare, climate, and energy attitudes.	A document is relevant to the query "linksrechts" if it explicitly discusses the left–right political orientation scale or contains survey items, coding, or results about left–right self-placement (e.g., the LinksRechtsSkala, questionnaire wording, translation issues, or cross-country comparisons of left–right positions). Materials describing pretests, cognitive interviews, or psychometric tests of left–right items—for example reports of face‑to‑face cognitive interviews used to refine a left–right question—are clearly relevant. Documents that focus on the PAWCER project’s topics (welfare, climate, energy) are only relevant when they also address measurement of political orientation; otherwise they are not. Watch for false positives such as texts using "links" and "rechts" as literal directions, file names, or unrelated code, or content that discusses redistribution attitudes without explicitly linking them to a left–right scale. Finally, language and tokenization edge cases matter: German variants (LinksRechtsSkala, links-rechts, linksrechts) and synonyms like “political ideology” or “left–right self-placement” should be treated as relevant matches.
22951	medienkonsum	instruments_tools	The user wants to understand how media consumption relates to empathy and how media-based empathy is measured—specifically information on the MBE scale (Happ & Pfetsch, 2015), its four subscales (medial concern, affective media empathy, cognitive media empathy, and video-game immersion), its psychometric properties across adolescents and adults, and the special role of immersion in games.	A document is relevant to the query "medienkonsum" if it directly examines media consumption behaviors, digital media use patterns, or measurement instruments that capture empathy and reactions in media contexts—such as the MBE/MBE‑Skala (mediale Anteilnahme, affektive/kognitive Medienempathie, immersion in video games) and its psychometric validation in adolescent and adult samples. Empirical studies that report sample sizes, factor structure, reliability, and links between media use and outcomes (e.g., aggression, cyberbullying, immersion effects) are highly pertinent because they address how media consumption shapes emotional responses. Documents that are not relevant include those focused solely on face‑to‑face empathy without any media context, on unrelated consumption types (e.g., food consumption), or on media production/marketing strategies that do not analyze users’ consumption or empathic responses. Edge cases include papers that mention "medienkonsum" only tangentially, studies of media multitasking or gameplay mechanics that do not assess empathic processes (borderline relevant), and translations or policy briefs in German that lack empirical measurement but summarize consumption trends (potentially relevant depending on depth).
2585	kriminalität	instruments_tools	A user wants an overview of crime-related research and survey instruments used in European projects, including topics like fear of crime and local safety perceptions, internet-facilitated pharmaceutical crime, illicit trade in cultural goods, and a youth self-report delinquency scale. They also need details on the specific survey questions and the cognitive pretesting methods applied (online/web probing, face‑to‑face and telephone cognitive interviews).	A document is relevant to the keyword "kriminalität" if it explicitly treats crime or criminality—its types, prevalence, victims or offenders, prevention and enforcement policies, or research about the “dark figure” of unreported crime. For example, texts like the AUDITS pretest (fear of crime, citizens’ safety perceptions), the ALPhA study (internet-facilitated drug crime and fraudulent medicine suppliers), the ILLICID project (illicit trade in antiquities and dark‑field measurement), or a youth self‑report delinquency scale are clearly relevant because they investigate criminal behavior, markets, or prevention. Documents that are non‑relevant either lack any crime content or only mention crime incidentally (e.g., a methodological paper on web‑probing without applying it to criminal topics, or administrative reports about unrelated municipal services). Edge cases include texts on “security” or “safety” that are relevant only when they address criminal threats (traffic safety as crime prevention vs. non‑criminal accident prevention), or pieces where the term appears as a substring or in translation errors; in such cases relevance depends on whether criminal intent, illegal markets, victimization, or law enforcement are substantively discussed. Good signals of relevance are explicit crime-related keywords, empirical measures of offenses or fear of crime, descriptions of illicit markets or offenders/victims, and discussion of prevention or policy responses.
26363	verkehrsmittel	instruments_tools	The user likely wants to know what "Verkehrsmittel" means in this context — i.e., modes or means of transportation — and how it is treated in the SEU scale. Specifically, they want to understand that transport use is one of seven content domains in the SEU, measured by items assessing awareness of the ecological consequences of one’s transport choices and related self-reported behaviors.	A document is relevant to the keyword "verkehrsmittel" when it explicitly treats means of transport or transport use (e.g., verkehrsmittelnutzung, verkehrsmittelwahl) as a substantive topic—particularly in relation to environmental attitudes, behavioral intentions, or the ecological consequences of transport choices, such as studies using the SEU scale or items that measure awareness of action consequences. Good examples are surveys comparing car versus public-transport use, questionnaires that include the four-item awareness-of-consequences measure for transport behavior, or papers that apply Maloney & Ward or Schwartz’s scales to transport-related pro-environmental actions. Documents are non-relevant if the term appears only in a list or as a passing example, or if the focus is technical (vehicle engineering, timetables, traffic law) with no connection to attitudes, behavior, or environmental impact. Edge cases include translated or compound forms (verkehrsmittelnutzung) which are relevant when they report specific measures or findings, but only moderately relevant when the mention is peripheral (e.g., a single item in a broad multi-domain scale).
26823	technology	instruments_tools	The user is looking for validated psychological measures and definitions related to attitudes toward technology — specifically a short, psychometrically tested "technology commitment" (Technikbereitschaft) scale that predicts successful use of new technologies (especially in older adults) and its three facets: technology acceptance, competence, and control beliefs. They also want information on a technophobia questionnaire that measures fear of technology across three dimensions: personal failure, human-versus-machine problems, and usability.	A document is relevant to the query "technology" when it centrally addresses people’s interactions with, attitudes toward, or measurement of responses to technology—for example studies that develop or validate scales of technology commitment, technology acceptance, competence, control beliefs, or technophobia. The provided paragraph is highly relevant because it reports the creation and psychometric validation of a short scale (Technikbereitschaft/TB) and a related questionnaire assessing technophobia across clear dimensions (personal failure, human-versus-machine, and usability), with application to predicting technology use in older adults. Documents that focus on technical specifications, engineering design, code, or hardware performance without considering human attitudes or adoption would be non-relevant even if they repeatedly use the word “technology.” Edge cases include research on digital literacy, usability, or policy: these are partially relevant when they measure or aim to change users’ readiness or fear of technology, but less relevant if they only discuss infrastructure, cost, or regulatory issues without human-centered measures.
2817	populismus	instruments_tools	A user searching "populismus" here wants to know whether and how perceived economic inequalities drive support for populist parties, and specifically whether experimentally providing factual information about income and wealth distribution changes perceived inequality and populist attitudes. They may also be looking for details and results of a pretest that evaluated the clarity and plausibility of two informational graphics about Germany’s income and wealth distribution (available in the pretest PDF).	A document is relevant for the keyword "populismus" when it explicitly examines populism or populist attitudes — for example studies that link perceived inequality to support for right‑wing populist parties (as shown by ISSP findings naming the Progress Party in Norway, the Danish People’s Party, and Austria’s FPÖ) or projects that experimentally test whether information about income/wealth distribution changes populist preferences. The paragraph above is clearly relevant because it describes the "Perceived Inequalities and Populism" project and an experiment designed to measure causal effects on populist attitudes, even if the reported pretest only evaluated informational graphics. Documents are only partially relevant if they concern preparatory materials (e.g., graphic pretests or Web‑Probing methods) for a populism study but do not contain measures of populist attitudes or outcomes. Non‑relevant documents are those that discuss inequality, survey methodology, or political parties without any connection to populism, or that use "populism" metaphorically in unrelated fields. Edge cases include texts describing parties or movements that are populist in practice but not labeled as such (which may still be relevant) and cross‑national or left‑ vs right‑wing distinctions that require reading the content to judge relevance.
28676	worklife	instruments_tools	The query "worklife" seeks information about work–life balance, working conditions, employment arrangements, and related wellbeing at work. The user is likely looking for survey instruments, measures, or research (e.g., ISSP, EWCS) on topics like job satisfaction, organizational commitment, work–family conflict, workplace mobbing, and digital skills at work.	A document is relevant to the query "worklife" when it directly addresses the relationship between work and other life domains or workplace conditions — for example studies or survey modules on work–life balance, working hours, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, workplace mobbing, or digital skills used at work. Concrete signals of relevance include survey questions or scales targeted at work-related constructs (e.g., ISSP work–life items, work–family conflict scales, the Luxembourg Workplace Mobbing Scale, or modules on ICT at work) and empirical results about employees’ or self‑employed persons’ working situations. Documents are non‑relevant when they focus on unrelated topics (household ICT use with no workplace module, purely methodological notes that do not cover work content, or instruments whose items are strictly about private life), even if they happen to contain the word “work” in metadata. Edge cases include methodological or translation reports — these are relevant only if they pertain to a workplace module or validate a work‑related scale; similarly, mixed‑scope instruments (e.g., ICT competence scales covering both private and work contexts) may be partially relevant depending on whether the workplace domain is analyzed separately.
2884	fremdenfeindlichkeit	instruments_tools	The user wants a clear definition and overview of "Fremdenfeindlichkeit" (xenophobia), including how it is measured in survey research—e.g., consumer ethnocentrism scales, attitude-toward-foreigners items, and law-and-order measures—and wants information on instrument development, validation, and theoretical background.	A document is relevant to the query "fremdenfeindlichkeit" if it explicitly addresses attitudes toward foreigners or xenophobia, for example by reporting scales, item batteries, or theoretical accounts of ethnocentrism and anti-foreign prejudice (such as the consumer ethnocentrism scale, ALLBUS items, Jacobys 1978, or law-and-order positions derived from Fend). The paragraph you supplied is relevant because it documents instruments that operationalize attitudes toward foreigners (e.g., a four‑item scale in ALLBUS) and links consumer ethnocentrism to moral and economic arguments against buying foreign goods. It would be less relevant if it only treated product preferences or marketing behavior without connecting those preferences to hostile beliefs about foreigners, or if it contained only statistical/methodological details with no attitudinal content. Borderline cases include studies of consumer ethnocentrism that focus purely on purchase intention (partially relevant) and "law-and-order" measures that may capture xenophobia when they explicitly target "everything foreign" but could instead reflect non‑xenophobic crime concerns. Finally, documents that lack information on instrument development, validation, or theoretical background (as noted in the paragraph) are still topically relevant but less useful for rigorous research until those details are obtained.
31126	schichtarbeit	instruments_tools	The user wants information about "schichtarbeit" (shift work): what it is and the different types of shift systems. They likely need details on legal regulations and workers' rights, effects on health and sleep, and practical scheduling or coping strategies for employers and employees.	A document is relevant to the keyword "schichtarbeit" if it directly discusses shift work topics such as types of shifts (night shifts, rotating/Wechselschicht), scheduling and rostering (Schichtplan), legal and collective-bargaining rules for shift schedules, or health and safety impacts like circadian disruption and fatigue. Useful examples include academic studies on the health effects of night work, employer policies or templates for shift rosters, guidance for nurses and factory workers on shift handovers, or software descriptions for shift planning. Documents are non-relevant when the term is absent or used metaphorically (e.g., "Schicht" meaning a geological layer or a painting layer), when job ads merely mention hours without specifying shift patterns, or when the mention of shift work is a passing aside with no substantive content. Edge cases include regional or legal variations (country-specific labor law references are relevant but only to that jurisdiction), documents using synonyms or misspellings (Nachtschicht, Schichtdienst, Wechselschicht), bilingual texts where "schichtarbeit" appears only in a caption, and scans/images with the word present but no searchable text—these can be borderline and require closer inspection for true relevance.
317	homeoffice	instruments_tools	I want to know what questions about working from home were developed and tested in the 2024 BIBB–BAuA employee survey pretest and in the FReDA family-demographic panel pretests, and how those items were administered and evaluated. Specifically, I need details on the content of the home-office items and the testing methods used (telephone cognitive interviews for BIBB–BAuA and web probing online pretests for FReDA).	A document is relevant to the keyword "homeoffice" when it directly discusses working from home or telework — for example surveys, pretests or studies about frequency of homeworking, digital tools used, team collaboration, leadership in remote settings, or policies enabling homeoffice. Documents that test or report questionnaire items on "Arbeit im Homeoffice," measure conditions and prevalence, or evaluate related variables (childcare while teleworking, division of household labor) are clearly relevant. Borderline cases include texts that only mention "homeoffice" in a long list of topics or as an item in a questionnaire without substantive findings; these may be less useful but still potentially relevant depending on the search intent. Non-relevant documents are those using "home office" in a different sense (e.g., the UK Home Office government department), selling home-office furniture, or discussing domestic cybersecurity or interior design without any employment/telework context. Also treat synonyms (Telearbeit, remote work, work-from-home) and German-language sources as relevant, while excluding unrelated usages or purely administrative mentions.
3365	drogen	instruments_tools	The user is looking for psychometric instruments and information related to drugs — specifically measures of adolescent drug-related delinquency, scales assessing treatment motivation for substance dependence (problem recognition, external pressure, need for help, treatment readiness), and questionnaires on reasons for not using smoking-cessation aids. They likely need these to identify suitable assessment tools for research or clinical evaluation of drug use and treatment engagement.	A document is relevant for the keyword "drogen" when it directly discusses drugs or substance use (e.g., Rauschmittel, Sucht, Abhängigkeit), drug‑related offenses, treatment for substance use disorders, or instruments that measure drug‑related behaviors and treatment motivation. For example, the paragraph mentions "Rauschmitteldelikte" (drug offenses), treatment motivation for dependence, and barriers to smoking‑cessation aids, so those passages would be relevant. A document that only treats general juvenile delinquency (theft, vandalism, violence) without any reference to substances would be non‑relevant, as would texts that merely use the word "drugs" metaphorically or in an unrelated context. Edge cases include materials about nicotine/tobacco cessation (may be relevant if the searcher intends "drogen" broadly), questionnaires that include a single drug‑related item among many non‑drug items (partially relevant), and documents in a different language or using only distant synonyms.
34145	rechtsextremismus	instruments_tools	The user is looking for a concise overview of "rechtsextremismus" (right-wing extremism), including its defining beliefs, typical behaviors and symbols. They also want information on associated groups, legal status, societal risks, and prevention or countermeasures.	A document is relevant to the keyword "rechtsextremismus" if it directly addresses right‑wing extremism — its ideology, organizations, incidents, historical development, legal definitions, counter‑extremism policies, research studies, or detailed news reporting — especially when the term or close synonyms (e.g., rechtsextrem, right‑wing extremism) appear in the title or body. Examples of relevant items are government reports on neo‑Nazi groups, academic analyses of recruitment tactics, school curricula about radicalization, and court decisions applying statutes against extremist activity. Non‑relevant documents include those that only mention the word in passing, discuss "extremism" generically without a right‑wing focus, cover mainstream conservative politics (right‑of‑center but non‑extremist), or use similar words in unrelated senses (e.g., rechts meaning “right” direction or legal "Recht"). Edge cases include materials that are topically relevant but problematic — such as propaganda, recruitment pages, or SEO‑stuffed content — which are still relevant to the query but require careful handling; also related terms like rechtspopulismus or translations into English may overlap with but not exactly match "rechtsextremismus."
34932	rightwing	instruments_tools	The user is likely looking for an explanation and measurement of right‑wing authoritarianism (RWA), specifically the BRWA6 short scale used in the Austrian National Election Study: its purpose, item format, and psychometric/theoretical background. They would want the scale's origin (Altemeyer 1981), the three subdimensions it measures (authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, and conventionalism), and information about validity and application in population surveys.	This document is relevant to the keyword "rightwing" when the intent is academic or psychological: it describes the BRWA6 balanced short scale for measuring Right‑Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) used in the Austrian National Election Study and explicitly references Altemeyer’s three subdimensions (authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, and conventionalism). It contains operational details (semantically opposed items, scale purpose, target population) and theoretical grounding useful for someone looking for measurement instruments, survey items, or psychometric validation related to right‑wing authoritarian attitudes. It is non‑relevant if the user is searching for news, party platforms, policy positions, or contemporary political movements labeled “right‑wing,” since this text focuses on scale construction and theory rather than political activity or ideology in the broader sense. Edge cases: the paragraph is in German, so it may be less useful to an English‑language searcher, and the term “rightwing” can also refer to unrelated contexts (sports, anatomy, or general conservative politics), where this methodological document would not match intent.
39506	sozialisation	instruments_tools	User wants a clear explanation of "socialization"—how family and early social experiences shape attitudes, values and behaviors. They also want to know how researchers operationalize and measure socialization in surveys and studies (e.g., parental behavior dimensions, scales for early musical socialization, items on family roles, and cognitive pretesting/translations).	This document is highly relevant to the keyword "sozialisation" because it explicitly treats familial and early-life socialization processes — e.g., "musikalische Frühsozialisation," "familiäre Sozialisationsbedingungen," "Primärsozialisation," and parental rearing behaviors — and links them to attitudes, identity and generative behavior. Relevant passages include concrete examples such as scales measuring parental support versus religious upbringing, biographical inventories capturing primary socialization, and questions about parental roles and desired family size. It would be less relevant if the emphasis of a document were purely methodological (translation checks, cognitive pretests, or questionnaire administration) or if the topic were an unrelated use of the word (e.g., "socialization" meaning a social event). Edge cases include texts that mention socialization only as a background variable or focus only on scale construction and psychometrics: these are partially relevant for terminology and measurement but less useful for substantive theorizing about socialization processes.
43698	covid19	instruments_tools	A user searching "covid19" here is likely seeking COVID‑19–related survey instruments and pretest documentation from German studies (FReDA, LoneCovid) — i.e., the infection and vaccination items, ego‑centric network questions, the epidemic‑related Dark Future Scale for children (eDFSK), and questionnaires for evaluating digital teaching. They want details on item wording/translations, cognitive testing methods (web probing, video interviews), target samples/ages (18–49 adults, partners, children 8–12, students) and how the instruments were implemented and validated.	A document is relevant to the query "covid19" when it directly addresses the coronavirus pandemic or its consequences — for example, questionnaires about COVID‑19 infection and vaccination, scales measuring pandemic-related anxiety in children, studies of social relationships during the COVID‑19 era, or evaluations of digital teaching implemented because of the pandemic. Concrete signals of relevance include explicit terms and variants (COVID‑19, Covid19, coronavirus, SARS‑CoV‑2), descriptions of pandemic‑specific methods (e.g., web probing of COVID items, video cognitive interviews about pandemic effects), and study timeframes tied to 2020–2021. A document is non‑relevant if it only mentions COVID‑19 tangentially (e.g., in passing as background) or if the token appears in metadata but the content focuses on unrelated topics; such items may be borderline relevant if the pandemic context meaningfully shapes the research design. Edge cases include translated items (German originals with English translations) where the translation quality affects keyword matching, and documents about other epidemics that compare to COVID‑19 — these are relevant only when the comparison substantially involves COVID‑19.
4811	ukraine	instruments_tools	A general informational overview about Ukraine, including basic facts (location, capital, population), and likely interest in its history, politics, economy, culture, or current events (such as the conflict with Russia) and practical details like travel or visa requirements.	A document is relevant to the keyword "ukraine" if it substantially discusses the country, its people, places, institutions, events, language, culture, or economy — for example a news report on the Russia–Ukraine conflict, a travel guide to Kyiv, a history of Ukrainian independence, or an economic analysis of Ukraine’s GDP. Relevant documents may use variants and related terms such as “Ukrainian,” “Kyiv”/“Kiev,” “Donbas,” “Crimea,” or Cyrillic spellings (Україна), so these should be treated as matches even if the exact English string isn’t present. Non-relevant documents include items that only mention Ukraine in passing (a long list of countries where Ukraine is one of dozens), use a similar-looking word unrelated to the country (e.g., the phrase “you crane”), or are about a company or product that happens to include “Ukraine” in its name but contains no substantive information about the country. Edge cases include misspellings and transliterations, documents focused on territories or cities that are part of Ukraine without naming the country explicitly, and works that are relevant only to a specific intent (e.g., visa application guides vs. breaking news), so matching intent and depth of coverage is important when judging relevance.
5030	sicherheitsgefühl	instruments_tools	Wanting to know how to measure residents' subjective sense of safety (Sicherheitsgefühl) in a municipality—covering fear of crime, street/traffic safety, and perceptions of local security work. Also seeking how these survey items were cognitively pretested online using the Web Probing method in the EU AUDITS project to inform local security policy analysis.	A document is relevant to the query "sicherheitsgefühl" if it explicitly studies or measures residents' subjective sense of safety—through surveys, interviews or perceptual indicators—and discusses how those perceptions inform local security policy. For example, texts that report on questions about fear of crime, safety in traffic, or citizens' perceptions of municipal safety work (as in the AUDITS project pretest using cognitive online web probing) are clearly pertinent. Documents that are not relevant include those that only give objective crime statistics, describe technical or IT-security measures, or discuss security policy in purely institutional terms without any attitudinal or perceptual data. Edge cases include papers that use synonyms (perceived safety, fear of crime), related constructs (trust in police, social cohesion) or methodological studies of survey instruments—these can be relevant even if they do not use the exact word "sicherheitsgefühl"—whereas pieces using the term in a different domain (e.g., workplace safety compliance or cybersecurity) may be false positives.
50581	digitalisierung	instruments_tools	The user wants an overview of surveys, questionnaires and validated measurement instruments related to "Digitalisierung" — including national and EU surveys on ICT use, workplace digitalisation and IoT modules, scales for digital skills and technology readiness (e.g., ICTSC25, TB), tests of technophobia, and evaluation tools for digital teaching. They need information about available items, languages (German/English), and how these questions were pretested (cognitive interviews/web probing).	A document is relevant to the keyword "digitalisierung" if it substantively addresses digital technologies, ICT use, digital skills or workplace digitalization — for example pretests and modules on ICT at work, IoT surveys, items about home office and digital tools, or instruments like the ICTSC25 and the technology-commitment/technophobia scales. Concrete examples of relevant documents are the BIBB/BAuA Erwerbstätigenbefragung pretest on digitalization of work, the Community Survey modules on ICT use or IoT, and questionnaires evaluating digital teaching implemented during COVID-19. A document is non-relevant if it only mentions "Digitalisierung" in passing, consists solely of administrative metadata (sampling frames, fieldwork logistics) without substantive digital content, or deals with unrelated topics where digital terms are used as buzzwords. Edge cases include bilingual translation or cognitive-testing reports: these are relevant if the tested items cover digital topics (even if the focus is on wording), whereas psychometric papers about unrelated constructs or historical descriptions that do not engage with digital technologies would be borderline or non-relevant.
51730	alkohol	instruments_tools	The user is likely seeking information on assessment tools for alcohol dependence, specifically a biographical questionnaire that evaluates underlying personality and life-history factors. They want to know which dimensions it measures (emotional insufficiency/neuroticism, adverse primary socialization, and goal striving) and how this biographical inventory differs from standard personality questionnaires by focusing on the patient's life story.	A document is relevant to the keyword "alkohol" when it substantively addresses alcohol use or alcohol dependence—especially assessment, treatment, epidemiology, or psychosocial instruments designed for people with alcohol problems. For example, the provided paragraph is relevant because it explicitly describes a biographical questionnaire constructed for alcohol-dependent individuals, maps personality dimensions related to alcoholism, and contrasts this inventory with general personality measures. Documents that are not relevant include those that only mention ethanol in a chemical or industrial context, recipes or marketing for alcoholic beverages, or texts where "alkohol" appears only incidentally (e.g., in a bibliography). Edge cases include papers in German (language does not reduce relevance if the topic is alcohol), general personality inventories that become relevant only when applied to alcohol-using samples, and studies focused on biomarkers or comorbid conditions that may be borderline unless they tie findings back to alcohol-specific assessment or outcomes.
52781	alkoholkonsum	instruments_tools	A person searching "alkoholkonsum" is likely seeking concise information about alcohol consumption—its prevalence, health risks and possible benefits, recommended drinking limits, and public‑health guidelines. They may want statistics, trends, or practical advice for safer drinking or reducing alcohol use.	A document is relevant to the keyword "alkoholkonsum" if it directly addresses patterns, prevalence, health effects, guidelines, policy or prevention related to alcohol drinking—for example public‑health reports, epidemiological studies, WHO or national drinking‑limit recommendations, or clinical guidance on risks and interventions. Useful documents give concrete details such as consumption metrics (standard drinks or grams of alcohol), age and demographic breakdowns, regional laws or trends, and clear outcomes (liver disease, accidents, pregnancy risks); a page summarizing a study on binge drinking rates in Germany would be a strong match. Non‑relevant documents merely mentioning the word in passing, focusing only on alcohol production or cocktail recipes, discussing unrelated chemicals called “alcohols” in chemistry, or being primarily promotional/advertising content are poor matches. Edge cases include language and scope: German‑language or region‑specific materials are often more pertinent for a German query, while older reports or paywalled abstracts may be less useful unless they provide unique historical or methodological insight. Finally, documents that clarify measurement units, thresholds, and context (e.g., pregnancy, youth, cultural norms) are especially valuable; superficial lists or SEO pages that lack data or interpretation should be deprioritized.
53774	berufsausbildung	instruments_tools	The query "berufsausbildung" seeks concise information about vocational training (apprenticeships) in Germany — what they are, their structure, duration, and legal/occupational framework. It may also ask how participation and outcomes are measured in surveys like the BIBB‑BAuA 2018 employment survey pretest (questions on training, workplace tasks, demands and health).	A document is relevant to the keyword "berufsausbildung" if it directly addresses vocational training and initial apprenticeship systems — for example, descriptions of the dual system, curricula, qualification outcomes, apprenticeship numbers, policy measures, or survey findings about participation in Aus- und Weiterbildung. The provided paragraph mentions "Aus- und Weiterbildung" within a broader BIBB/BAuA employment survey, so it would be partially relevant if the report contains substantive results about vocational training, apprenticeship pathways, or training needs identified in the survey. It is non‑relevant if the document only covers survey methodology, pretest procedures, cognitive interview techniques, or focuses solely on occupational health and workload without linking findings to vocational education. Edge cases include texts that discuss continuing education or in‑company training (Weiterbildung) — these can be borderline relevant depending on whether they treat initial vocational qualifications; likewise, mentions of "Ausbildung" in purely historical, legal, or non‑German contexts may be less useful despite keyword overlap.
54621	beschäftigungsverhältnis	instruments_tools	The user is likely asking for the meaning and operational use of the German term "Beschäftigungsverhältnis" — i.e., a person’s employment relationship or employment status (employee vs. self‑employed, employer, unpaid family worker; contract type such as full/part‑time, permanent vs. temporary, formal vs. informal). They may also want to know how that variable is recorded in surveys and classifications (for example ESeC uses it together with ISCO08 job codes and occupational position to assign socio‑economic class, and caregiving surveys use it to identify whether and how care workers are employed and paid).	A document is relevant to the query "beschäftigungsverhältnis" if it explicitly discusses the type or status of employment relationships — for example distinctions between formal vs informal work, full‑time/part‑time, self‑employment vs employee status, or the variable "Art des Beschäftigungsverhältnisses" used in coding. Items that describe how employment-status information is collected or harmonized (e.g. ESeC/ISCO08 recoding rules, SPSS syntax, or survey questions about employment and payment of care workers) are directly useful. A document is not relevant if it only mentions employment in passing or focuses solely on a different topic (e.g. survey methodology like the Person Count Technique) without providing definitions, categories, or operationalization of employment relationships. Edge cases include texts that use synonymous terms ("Arbeitsverhältnis", "employment status", "Beschäftigung") — these are relevant if they contain the same operational detail — and materials in another language that quote the German variable name, which can be relevant for cross‑national coding.
56089	arbeitsleistung	instruments_tools	The user is looking for a clear definition and explanation of the German term "Arbeitsleistung" (work performance/work output), including how it’s measured or calculated and its relevance in workplace, legal, or technical contexts. They may also want examples and practical ways to assess or improve employee productivity.	A document is relevant to the keyword "arbeitsleistung" if it explicitly discusses work performance or the amount of work delivered—e.g., HR guidance on employee performance evaluation, employment contract clauses about duties or performance-based pay, measurement methods for productivity, or German case law and statutes interpreting an employee’s duty to render Arbeitsleistung. Useful signals of relevance are the term appearing in the title or headings, presence of definitions, examples of how performance is measured (KPIs, output metrics), sample contract language, or citations of labor law (collective agreements, Betriebsvereinbarungen, court decisions). Non-relevant documents merely mentioning the word in passing, focusing on unrelated meanings (for example technical literature about electrical "Leistung" = power, or physics discussions of work and energy that don’t concern labor), or poor machine translations that garble context should be excluded. Edge cases include ambiguity between legal/HR intent and scientific usage, compound words or variants (e.g., "Erbringung der Arbeitsleistung", "Arbeitsleistungspflicht"), and documents in other languages — in those cases look for surrounding context (contract, employer/employee, KPIs, statute citations) to disambiguate relevance.
56749	antisemitism	instruments_tools	A user searching "antisemitism" here is likely looking for survey items and methodological information about measuring antisemitic attitudes in German social surveys (e.g., the ZHPFGZ Cohesion Panel and ALLBUS). They want the actual question wordings (including English translations), details on cognitive pretesting methods used (web probing, face-to-face cognitive interviews), and findings about item comprehension and response difficulties.	Relevant documents explicitly treat antisemitism by defining it, presenting survey items or scales about antisemitic attitudes, reporting prevalence or trends, or describing the testing and adaptation of antisemitism questions (for example, cognitive pretests or Allbus evaluations of antisemitism items). Documents that only list antisemitism among many topics without giving item wordings, results, or measurement detail are less relevant because they do not enable assessment of how antisemitism was operationalized. Methodological reports about web probing or panel design are relevant only when they discuss the antisemitism items specifically; otherwise they are incidental. Edge cases include translated questionnaires or metadata-only datasets — these are useful if they preserve original German item wordings or provide clear variable descriptions, but are only partially relevant if they lack the actual items or results.
58154	gesundheitszustand	instruments_tools	The user wants to know how the study measures "Gesundheitszustand" — specifically which survey items (self-rated health compared with peers, relative timing preferences for illness, and the estimated probability of using preventive care) are used to predict skin‑cancer screening decisions. They also want to know these items were pretested via face‑to‑face cognitive interviews (with simultaneous interpreters by video) in Serbian, Arabic, Farsi, Russian and English as part of the RESPOND project on asylum‑seeker care.	A document is relevant to the keyword gesundheitszustand if it explicitly addresses health status or measures of it — for example self-rated health, comparisons with peers, clinical condition, or survey items asking about one’s own health. The paragraph is relevant because it directly mentions “Einschätzung der eigenen Gesundheit im Vergleich mit Gleichaltrigen” and links preventive behavior (skin cancer screening) and perceived disease risk to respondents’ health perceptions. It would be non-relevant if the text only discusses unrelated topics (e.g., interpreter logistics, econometric methods, or general project administration) without content on health status. Edge cases include texts that do not use the German term but clearly measure health via screening uptake or risk-probability questions (still relevant), versus passages that mention the word only in passing or metaphorically (borderline or non-relevant).
60378	führungsstil	instruments_tools	The query asks for a concise summary of the Leader–Member Exchange (LMX) scale as a measure of leadership style — developed by Graen and Uhl‑Bien (1995) from transactional leadership theory and grounded in dyadic social exchange (Dansereau et al., 1998) — and completed by employees. The LMX captures relationship quality (trust, respect, encouragement, affection) via two main dimensions (supervisor promotion of employee self‑worth and satisfactory employee performance) and subscales for affection, loyalty, professional respect and perceived engagement, using everyday item wording.	A document is relevant to the query "führungsstil" if it discusses leader–follower interaction patterns and measurement of leadership behavior, for example by describing the Leader–Member Exchange (LMX) scale, its dyadic focus, subscales (affection, loyalty, professional respect, perceived commitment), and core aspects such as trust, respect, encouragement and employee-rated items. Concrete signals of relevance are mention of Graen and Uhl-Bien (1995), the transactional leadership basis, that the questionnaire is completed by employees, or practical examples of how LMX captures differences in supervisory support and performance expectations. A document is non-relevant if it only uses the word "Führungsstil" in passing, treats leadership solely as administrative procedure, or focuses exclusively on unrelated topics (e.g., corporate policy or IT systems) without addressing interpersonal leadership patterns. Edge cases include psychometric validation papers (partially relevant if they discuss conceptual implications for leadership style, less so if they only report factor analyses) and translations or language-only descriptions that omit substantive links to leadership behavior.
6267	abtreibung	instruments_tools	The user is seeking the specific legal paragraph(s) on abortion in German law (commonly §218 StGB), including the statutory text, what conduct is prohibited or permitted, applicable exceptions, penalties, and any procedural rules or recent legal changes.	Relevant documents explicitly address "Abtreibung" together with the legal paragraph or statutes that govern it (for example discussions of Germany’s §218 StGB), court decisions, official government guidance, medical protocols for lawful terminations, or scholarly/legal commentary that quotes or analyzes the specific paragraph. Examples of strong relevance are the text of the criminal code, explanatory notes from a health ministry, legal blogs that cite the paragraph number and its amendments, or news stories that explain how a particular paragraph was applied in a court case. Non-relevant documents merely use the term in passing, use "paragraph" in a typographic or editorial sense, discuss unrelated statutory paragraphs, or focus only on personal anecdotes without linking to legal text. Edge cases include historical or comparative pieces that mention an old version of the paragraph (relevant for context), translations that use "abortion" instead of "Abtreibung" (still relevant), and opinion pieces that reference the paragraph number but do not explain its content (partially relevant). Look for clear signals of legal citation, quoted statutory language, or authoritative sources to determine strong relevance.
6346	worklifebalance	instruments_tools	The user is looking for how "work–life balance" is measured in the ISSP survey—specifically the work–family conflict items (work interfering with family and family interfering with work), their wording and scale. They also want methodological details about the German pretest (face‑to‑face cognitive interviews) and the fact that the documented items are English translations of original German questions with a link to the 2015 source questionnaire.	This document is relevant because it explicitly discusses ISSP survey questions on work-life balance, working hours, and a four-item work–family conflict scale (measuring work interference with family and family interference with work), and notes that items were pretested in German and translated to English. It is especially useful when it contains the actual item wordings, details of the cognitive (face-to-face) pretests, or notes on measurement and validity, which researchers can use as examples of instrument construction. It would be non-relevant if the file only contains administrative history (e.g., ISSP membership growth), formatting metadata (font, style tags), or a brief passing mention without any substantive questions or scale information. Edge cases include documents that use the concatenated token "worklifebalance" or only mention related terms (e.g., “working hours”) without the conflict scale — these may be partially relevant but could be missed by strict exact‑match searches — and translations that do not match the original German wording, which are useful for context but may not substitute for the source items.
6501	homosexualität	instruments_tools	A short informative paragraph that defines homosexuality — the pattern of romantic or sexual attraction to people of the same sex — and summarizes its social, cultural, and legal context. The user likely wants a concise, neutral explanation suitable for an essay, schoolwork, or general background.	A document is relevant to the keyword "homosexualität" if it substantially discusses homosexuality—its definitions, history, legal status, health issues, social attitudes, cultural representation, or policy debates—especially when written in German or using closely related terms like "homosexuality," "gay," "lesbisch," or "LGBT." Relevant examples include scholarly articles on the history of homosexuality in Germany, news reports about LGBT rights, advocacy pages, medical or psychological analyses, and law texts that explicitly address the status of homosexual people. A document is non-relevant if the term appears only incidentally (e.g., a single passing mention, a filename, or metadata), if the content is about an unrelated subject that only uses the word in a quote or list, or if the page is purely an image with no textual discussion. Edge cases include pornographic or hate sites that mention the term—these are topically relevant but may be low quality or unsafe—and documents that use compound or misspelled forms (e.g., "homosexualitätsdiskurs" or "homosexuality") which should still be considered relevant if the core topic matches. Title and heading mentions usually indicate higher relevance than brief body mentions, and translations or synonym-heavy pages should be evaluated for depth of coverage rather than keyword presence alone.
67543	flüchtling	instruments_tools	The user is looking for information about refugees (Flüchtlinge), specifically research on improving healthcare and service structures for asylum seekers — in this case the RESPOND project at Heidelberg University Hospital, its goals to create evidence for more effective, efficient, and needs-based care, and the methods used (cognitive interviews in multiple languages with remote simultaneous interpreters).	A document is relevant to the keyword "Flüchtling" if it directly discusses refugees or asylum seekers (German: Flüchtlinge/Asylsuchende), their legal status, access to services (healthcare, housing, education), or policies and research aimed at improving their care. For example, the RESPOND paragraph is relevant because it explicitly targets Asylsuchende and describes a research project testing interview materials in multiple languages to improve healthcare provision. A document that only mentions migration broadly, tourists, or uses the string "flüchtig" in an unrelated sense would be non‑relevant, and reports that aggregate migrants without separating refugees may be only partially relevant. Edge cases include texts that use synonyms or foreign-language equivalents (refugee, refugiado, Schutzsuchende), studies of internally displaced persons or mixed-migrant flows (which can be relevant depending on scope), and methodological papers that include refugees as a minor subgroup rather than the main focus.
6763	psychotherapie	instruments_tools	The user is looking for a concise overview of psychotherapeutic assessment instruments—particularly German-language questionnaires used to screen and quantify problems like health anxiety/hypochondria (Whiteley Index), pathological worry and GAD (PSWQ, Münsteraner Sorgenfragebogen), irritation/stress reactions, workaholism, and broad psychosocial traits (Giessen Test short scales). They likely want to know what each tool measures, how it’s structured and validated, and how it’s used clinically for screening, differential diagnosis, and treatment planning.	A document is relevant to the query "psychotherapie" if it discusses psychotherapeutic assessment, diagnosis, treatment planning, referral to therapy, intervention methods, or outcome monitoring — for example descriptions of instruments used to identify patients who need psychotherapy or to track symptom change during therapy. Psychometric descriptions become clearly relevant when they are tied to clinical decisions: the Whiteley Index’s use to detect hypochondriacal beliefs for referral to specialized treatment or the PSWQ’s role in identifying excessive worry as a target for CBT are directly pertinent. By contrast, purely technical validation studies, isolated scale item lists, or descriptions of somatic-sensory questionnaires that do not link findings to therapeutic action are less relevant. Edge cases include German-language instrument manuals (language does not reduce relevance), preventive screening tools that recommend interventions (relevant), and historical DSM citations that affect diagnostic criteria used in therapy (relevant), whereas instruments presented only for research or psychometric benchmarking without clinical application are borderline or non-relevant.
718	turkey	instruments_tools	The user is seeking information about "turkey," an ambiguous term that could refer to the country Turkey, the bird (or its meat/dishes), or related topics like travel, history, recipes, or nutrition. They likely want concise facts, definitions, or practical guidance depending on which sense of the word they mean.	The single-word query "turkey" is ambiguous, so a relevant document clearly matches the intended sense — for example, a recipe describing roasting a turkey (including details like oven temperature and cooking time), an ornithology paper on Meleagris (wild or domesticated turkeys), or a travel advisory, history, or news piece about the country Turkey (capital Ankara, geopolitical coverage). Non-relevant documents either only mention "turkey" in passing or use unrelated senses or idioms (e.g., a sports article about a "turkey" in bowling, the phrase "turkey shoot," or an article about turkey vultures) that don’t match the user’s intent. Edge cases include documents using different spellings or languages (Türkiye, Turquía) that are still relevant to the country, pages about vegan substitutes like "tofurkey" which are only tangentially relevant to the bird, and scientific texts that use Latin names — these should be judged relevant if the surrounding context aligns with the user’s likely meaning. Finally, relevance depends on prominence and specificity: a page devoted to turkey topics is more relevant than a long article where "turkey" appears once without substantive information.
810	bildungsgrad	instruments_tools	The user wants a clear definition and translation of the German term "Bildungsgrad"—i.e., the level or degree of education—along with how it is measured or classified and common contexts or synonyms where the term is used.	A document is relevant for the keyword "bildungsgrad" if it explicitly discusses a person's or group's educational level or attainment, such as descriptions of primary/secondary/tertiary education, years of schooling, degrees, qualifications, or survey statistics measuring education. Relevant examples include demographic studies reporting average bildungsgrad, CVs and application forms listing an applicant's bildungsgrad, policy papers on education levels, and datasets using ISCED codes or years of schooling as proxies. Documents are non-relevant when the word appears only once in passing, in unrelated boilerplate or metadata, as an OCR/artifact error, or in contexts where "grad" means degree/angle/temperature rather than education. Edge cases include texts using synonyms or translations ("educational level," "Schulabschluss") that are conceptually relevant despite not containing the exact keyword, and bilingual documents where the German term appears alongside an English explanation; these should be considered relevant if the educational concept is clearly addressed.
9616	politikverdrossenheit	instruments_tools	The user is looking for a clear definition and overview of "Politikverdrossenheit" (political disaffection/cynicism), including its causes, consequences, and how it differs from related concepts. They also likely want information on how it is measured in surveys—e.g., the AUTNES short scale of political cynicism (KPZ)—and details about the scale’s theoretical basis and psychometric quality.	A document is relevant to the keyword "politikverdrossenheit" if it directly addresses political disaffection or cynicism — for example definitions, survey instruments (like the Kurzskala politischer Zynismus, KPZ), item wordings, sampling procedures, and psychometric results used to measure general mistrust of political authorities. Relevant examples include AUTNES reports describing the KPZ, papers evaluating its reliability and validity, or studies linking political cynicism to turnout and trust in institutions. Documents that discuss related constructs such as political apathy, alienation, or distrust can be partially relevant if they explicitly connect those concepts to measurement or to the same generalized skepticism toward officeholders. Non-relevant documents would be those that merely use the term metaphorically, focus on unrelated policy topics, or discuss cynicism in a purely philosophical or literary sense without empirical measurement. Edge cases include texts in other languages (German-language sources are often highly relevant), papers that only mention KPZ in passing, and studies that examine individual personality cynicism rather than system-directed politikverdrossenheit, which may be only tangentially useful.
