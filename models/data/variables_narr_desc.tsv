100	immigrant	A request for survey questions and public-opinion measures about immigrants, covering attitudes on assimilation and cultural impact, economic effects, crime and jobs, illegal immigration/exclusion, and different immigrant origins (e.g., Eastern Europe, south of the Mediterranean, EU asylum seekers). The user likely wants to find or analyze questionnaire items that measure acceptance of immigrants and perceived societal impacts.	A document is relevant when immigrants are the central subject — for example when it contains survey items, policy statements, or analyses about immigrants’ economic, cultural, or legal impacts (e.g., questions on whether “immigrants increase crime rates,” “take jobs away,” “undermine culture,” or about “illegal immigrants” and “EU immigrants seeking political asylum”). Text that lists variable codes and repeated questionnaire items (Q9a, V52, v315–v318) is relevant if those codes map to substantive questions or responses, because it shows the document captures public attitudes and subgroup distinctions (Eastern Europe, South of the Mediterranean, other EU countries). A document is non‑relevant if “immigrant” appears only as a stray label, file code, or in an unrelated context (e.g., metadata, variable names with no question text), or if it actually discusses emigration, tourists, or student exchange rather than people settling. Edge cases include mixed or noisy transcripts (repeated lines, truncated items) and documents that mention immigrants but only in passing or at a different granularity (legal status vs cultural integration); relevance in those cases depends on whether the user cares about broad coverage of attitudes or only specific subtopics like asylum, crime, or labor market effects.
10109	politik	The user is looking for survey items and response codes measuring public attitudes toward politicians — e.g., whether politicians keep their promises, which parties’ politicians are seen as most/least trustworthy (SPD, FDP, Republicans, Greens, none), and perceived influence of banks on politics. They also want questions that record how many and which politicians respondents name and which politicians should not become federal ministers.	A document is relevant to the keyword "politik" when it substantively discusses politics or political actors — for example it contains items about Politiker, party names (SPD, FDP, Republikaner, GRÜNE), questions on whether politicians keep promises, the influence of banks on politics, or survey instruments labeled F.19 with answer codes. Relevance is strengthened by repeated political question wording and metadata like variable IDs (V242, V247) that indicate a political survey or questionnaire rather than a passing mention. A document is non-relevant if "politik" appears only once or as part of a non-political phrase (e.g., a company policy, course title, or isolated token) and there is no substantive discussion of political topics. Edge cases include texts about specific subfields such as Außenpolitik or Realpolitik (these are relevant but narrower in scope), badly formatted transcripts or duplicated lines (which may still be useful if they are a political survey), and language mismatches — German-language political content is clearly relevant for the query "politik," whereas documents using the English word "policy" may not be unless intent is broader.
10418	politic	The user is looking for survey items measuring political attitudes and engagement. Specifically, they want questions about whether political parties are necessary, frequency of political discussion (in class and with friends), political information exposure, political interest and participation, how politics influences one’s life, and preferences for ideal party characteristics.	A document is relevant to the keyword "politic" when its primary content addresses political subjects—public institutions, political parties, civic participation, political opinions or survey items about politics—and provides substantive text (e.g., questions like "Are political parties necessary?" or passages about discussing politics in class). Clear examples of relevance are survey prompts about party ideals, questions on political activity or influence, and paragraphs explaining party functions or political discussion. A document is non-relevant if it only contains the substring "politic" in metadata, variable codes, filenames, or as an adjective meaning "prudent" rather than discussing politics substantively. Edge cases include references to "office" or "family politics" (interpersonal maneuvering) which are relevant only if the intended focus is public/policy politics; similarly, long lists of repeated variable labels or template wording mention politics but offer little topical content and should be scored as low-utility relevance.
1112	politisches interesse	A user searching for "politisches Interesse" wants measures or survey items that assess how interested someone is in politics and related attitudes. Specifically, they are looking for questions that ask respondents to rate their political interest on a 0–10 ladder, name whether a party represents their interests, and indicate how much they care about the interests/living conditions of various groups (family, neighbours, region, fellow countrymen, Europeans, humankind, elderly, unemployed, sick/disabled, immigrants) plus rankings of which social groups (workers, employees/civil servants, farmers, middle class, upper class) should be represented.	A document is relevant to the keyword "politisches interesse" when it explicitly addresses interest in politics or contains survey items that measure political interest, such as ladder-scale questions ("Stufen Sie bitte Ihr Interesse an Politik..."), direct labels like "Politikinteresse" or items asking how much respondents care about political representation and parties. Examples of clearly relevant content are the German questionnaire items asking respondents to rate their interest on a 0–10 ladder, questions about whether a party represents their interests, and lists of concerns for social groups (elderly, immigrants, neighbours) tied to political attitudes. A document is non-relevant if it only uses the word "Interessen" in non-political senses (economic or organizational interests), consists solely of metadata or codes (e.g., V183, variable labels) without the substantive questions, or mentions politics only tangentially (e.g., a news headline listing "Bundeswehr" without discussion of citizens' political interest). Edge cases include fragments or bilingual texts: a short extract containing the ladder question or "Politikinteresse" is highly relevant even if brief, whereas a list of social groups (workers, farmers, entrepreneurs) is only partially relevant unless it is explicitly framed as political priorities or demands.
1156	religion	The user is looking to capture the respondent’s childhood religion (e.g., Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, indigenous, other, or none) and any specific denomination, and to record spouse’s, mother’s, and father’s religions. They also want those answers mapped into compressed religion group variables (RELIGGRP) with country-specific question mappings for use in comparative survey analysis.	A document is relevant to the keyword "religion" when it contains survey question text, coding schemes, or derived variables that explicitly capture religious affiliation or upbringing—such as items asking "What religion if any were you raised in?", follow-ups about denomination, or fields for spouse's, mother's, or father's religion. Relevant examples include compressed group variables like RELIGGRP, country-specific question variants (e.g., Q20a in Georgia, Q22 in Kenya), and prompts that list response categories (Protestant, Catholic, Muslim, Jewish, indigenous beliefs, no religion). Documents are non-relevant if they only mention "religion" metaphorically or discuss theological/historical topics without providing survey items, variable names, or coding needed for data harmonization. Edge cases to watch: records that use different labels for the same category (e.g., "no religion" vs. "none"), "other/indigenous beliefs" entries that require recoding, and snippets that contain variable IDs (V52, Q22) or repeated boilerplate—these are relevant for mapping but may need normalization or additional context to be fully useful.
11910	persönlichkeit	The user wants personality assessments that respondent “B” holds about a list of German politicians (e.g., Hannelore Kraft, Claudia Roth, Helmut Kohl, etc.), i.e., who B thinks what about each. They also seek the corresponding scale scores and deviations ("Skalometer politischer Persönlichkeiten" and "Abweichung") for those political figures to compare and analyze perceived personalities.	A document is relevant to the query "persönlichkeit" when it discusses individual persons’ character, reputation, or evaluative judgments — for example lines like "Was hält B von H. Kraft" (what B thinks of Hannelore Kraft) or entries titled "Skalometer politischer Persönlichkeiten" that measure or rate politicians’ traits are strong signals of relevance. Documents that merely list names or repeated index entries without descriptive text (e.g., long duplicate name lists) are less relevant because they do not convey personality information. Meta-data such as numeric deviations ("Abweichung") or a score-sheet is relevant only if it is accompanied by interpretation (what the score says about a person); raw tables or IDs alone are borderline. Language and sense disambiguation matter: German-language profiles of political figures match the query closely, while documents using "personality" in the sense of celebrity branding or psychometric testing can be relevant but require confirming context. Finally, short or noisy fragments (repeated lines, navigation labels, or file names) are non-relevant edge cases unless they link to substantive profiles or measured assessments.
1259	sexuelle orientierung	The user is looking for information about sexual orientation, especially public attitudes and survey measures in Germany — for example views on same-sex relationships, experiences and prevalence of sexual harassment at work, and opinions about legal protections and institutional sexual abuse. They likely want sample survey question wording, public-opinion results, or summaries of how these topics are discussed in recent debate.	A document is relevant to the keyword "sexuelle orientierung" if it explicitly treats sexual orientation or public attitudes toward it — for example survey items or analyses that use terms like "Homosexualität", "sexuelle Beziehungen zwischen zwei Erwachsenen des gleichen Geschlechts", or variable codes (e.g. ISSP/V400–V447) that ask respondents about same‑sex relationships or homophobia. Concrete examples of relevant content are questionnaire items asking "How do you feel about sexual relationships between two adults of the same sex," behavioral‑attitude measures toward homosexuality, or legal/policy discussions that concern lesbians, gays or bisexual people. Documents that only discuss sexual harassment of women, workplace flirtation, or sexual abuse in the church without any link to sexual orientation are non‑relevant, since they address different phenomena (gendered violence or child abuse rather than orientation). Edge cases include texts that mention homosexuality only incidentally inside broader harassment or abuse reports (these are partially relevant if they address orientation‑based harassment) and pieces conflating sexual orientation with gender identity — those require closer inspection to decide relevance.
12604	personal	Determine for each household member whether they have any personal income (yes/no) and, where available, record each person’s personal monthly/net income amount. Also capture the exact number of persons in the household, identify who contributes most to household income and their relationship to the respondent, and note related financial indicators (e.g., mortgage, overdraft, chequebook) if relevant.	A document is relevant to the query "personal" when it explicitly concerns personal income or asks, for each household member, whether that person "has a personal income" — for example fields like hh1inca–hh8inca, "personal monthly net income," "Income Per person," or repeated questions "Do you personally have ...". Items that specify per-person income, who contributes most to household income, or country-specific personal income codes (e.g. FR RINC13, V202) are strongly relevant because they directly address individual-level financial status. Documents that focus on unrelated household attributes (number of people in the unit only), banking products (mortgage, overdraft, chequebook) or attitudinal questions about social mobility are non-relevant unless they explicitly link to an individual's personal income. Edge cases include instances where "personal" appears as a pronoun in other survey items ("Do you personally...") or as part of a product name — these are relevant only if the content concerns a respondent's own income or possessions; variable names and repeated noisy labels are useful metadata but do not change relevance unless they carry substantive personal-income information.
1293	alcohol	A person searching "alcohol" here is looking for survey questions and measures about alcohol use, attitudes, policies, and stigma. Specifically they want items covering past-month drinking, support for warning labels on bottles and adverts, descriptions and social perceptions of alcoholics, self-reported drinking relative to others, safe-driving drink thresholds, alcohol at work, and age of first drink.	A document is relevant to the keyword "alcohol" when it meaningfully discusses alcoholic beverages, drinking behaviour, policy or health issues — for example survey items asking "Did you drink any alcohol in the past four weeks?", items about warnings on bottles or adverts, age of first drink, or attitudes toward alcoholics. Concrete, specific content such as consumption frequency, number of drinks before not driving, policy support, or descriptions of alcoholics is highly relevant because it directly answers information needs about use, risk and public opinion. Edge cases depend on user intent: a chemistry paper about ethanol as a solvent or a safety data sheet for isopropyl alcohol is relevant for industrial or toxicology queries but less useful for public-health or social-survey queries about drinking. Non-relevant documents include ones that only contain "alcohol" incidentally (e.g., in a product name, email address, or a single passing mention) or use it metaphorically; such incidental mentions should be scored low unless the user’s intent is broad. In practice score relevance high when the document contains measures, attitudes, policies or outcomes related to drinking, moderate when the mention is tangential or technical, and low when the occurrence is incidental or ambiguous.
1326	demokratie	The user is looking for survey items and variable labels measuring "Demokratiezufriedenheit" — i.e., public satisfaction with democracy in Germany — and responses about the current state and future of democracy in Turkey under President Erdoğan. They likely need the exact question wording, associated variable IDs (e.g., V110, V146, V211), or the survey data to analyze public attitudes toward democracy in both countries.	A document is relevant to the query "demokratie" if it explicitly discusses democracy (Demokratie) in the sense of public attitudes, satisfaction or survey questions — for example texts that ask "Wie zufrieden oder unzufrieden sind Sie ... mit der Demokratie in Deutschland" or probe "Was meinen Sie zur Zukunft der Demokratie in der Türkei / unter Präsident Erdogan." Entries that contain the questionnaire wording, response options, or variable labels (e.g. V110, V211, DEMOKRATIEZUFRIEDENHEIT) are highly relevant because they directly match the intent to find measures of democracy satisfaction. Non-relevant documents mention "democracy" only peripherally (a single passing reference), use a different sense of the term (metaphorically), or focus exclusively on legal theory, history, or policy without measuring attitudes. Edge cases include repeated or uppercase variable lists (duplication or formatting noise still relevant if the survey question text is present) and files that contain only variable codes without the question wording (these are less useful). Documents in German about Germany or Turkey are particularly pertinent, while sources in unrelated languages or about other countries may be only partially relevant.
13621	kultur	The query asks about "culture" in a survey context — primarily which international organization handles culture and science (e.g., UNESCO) and about common survey items measuring public attitudes toward cultural diversity, minority lifestyles, and COVID-related closures of cultural and leisure venues. The user likely wants a concise identification of the relevant organization(s) and example survey questions or response options.	This document is highly relevant to the keyword "kultur" because it repeatedly uses the German term and contains many items explicitly about culture (e.g., "Welche der folgenden internationalen Organisationen beschäftigt sich mit Kultur und Wissenschaft" and references to "Kulturen", "Lebensweisen" and "Kultur und Freizeiteinrichtungen"). Concrete examples that increase relevance are the survey questions about different lifestyles, religions and cultures in Germany and the item asking which international organization deals with culture and science (an implicit reference to bodies like UNESCO). Some parts are noisy or metadata (pk14, V745, to03) and there is heavy repetition, which reduces usefulness but not topicality. Possible edge cases that would make this document less relevant: a user seeking in-depth cultural analysis or policy rather than survey items, or a case where "Kultur" appears only incidentally as part of COVID-19 closure notices. Overall it is topically relevant for queries about "kultur," but you should verify whether you want organizational information, public opinion survey content, or cleaned text without repeated template markers.
1537	social media	A person wants to know whether people follow public debates on social media (e.g., reading articles, online networks or blogs) and how they would respond if their social media or email account were hacked — specifically who they would contact (police, provider, consumer organisation, website, or no one). They may also be asking for opinions on how radio/TV/newspapers report poverty and social exclusion.	A document is relevant if it explicitly discusses following debates on social media — for example articles, threads or blog posts about online debates, platform-specific discussions (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit), or survey items that ask “Do you follow debates on social media?” It is also relevant when it addresses social media accounts specifically in a cybercrime context (e.g., “your social media or email account being hacked”) because that ties the security issue to social platforms. Non-relevant documents focus on other topics even if they reuse similar words — for instance pieces about poverty in the media that never mention social networks, general cybercrime guidance about banking/passwords without reference to social accounts, or raw survey metadata and question codes with no substantive social-media content. Edge cases include texts that mention “social” in other senses (social services, social policy) or only list “social media” in metadata or a long enumeration; those may be false positives unless the main content actually discusses online networks, blogs, or social-account issues. As a rule, require explicit mention of social networks, online debates, blogs, or social-account hacking to mark a document relevant.
15423	jugendliche	The user wants survey questions and public‑opinion information about adolescents in Germany. Specifically they are looking for items on youth violence and fear, the impact of banning violent video games, causes and blame for youth unemployment, recent youth riots (including immigrant youth), reports of sexual abuse in church institutions, household counts of 14–19‑year‑olds, and whether unions or government protect youth interests.	A document is relevant to the keyword "jugendliche" when it explicitly addresses young people or adolescent-specific issues — for example survey questions or statistics about juvenile violence, jugendarbeitslosigkeit (youth unemployment), age brackets like 14–16 or 17–19, sexual abuse of children and adolescents, the effects of banning violent computer games on youth, or public attitudes toward riots by young people. It is non‑relevant when the text treats crime, employment, or policy in purely general terms without an age focus, or when the word "jugendliche" appears only as a stray metadata tag, a place name, or part of an unrelated compound (e.g., "Jugendherberge") that does not concern adolescents. Edge cases include documents that discuss topics such as video‑game regulation or public order: these are relevant only if they explicitly link the issue to youth behaviour or youth policy, otherwise they may be false positives. Survey instruments and question lists (raw questionnaire items) are relevant even if they are repetitive or noisy, because they show what was asked about adolescents; by contrast, documents about adults or population totals that lack age‑specific breakdowns should be treated as non‑relevant. Finally, language differences (German vs. translated text) do not change relevance if the content clearly pertains to young people.
1552	religiosität	The user wants to know the father's religious affiliation when the respondent was about 11–12 years old. This information is sought to measure parental religiosity during the respondent’s childhood.	This document is relevant to the keyword "religiosität" because it explicitly asks about parental religiosity — using terms like "Religiosität," "Konfession," "Religionsgemeinschaft" and a concrete survey item about which religious community the respondent’s father belonged to when the respondent was 11 or 12. It is especially useful for people interested in measurement of religiosity in surveys, historical/age-specific affiliation, or variable coding (note the item code V322). Documents that merely mention religion in passing, discuss theology or spirituality in a philosophical sense, or focus on unrelated family members without addressing parental affiliation would be non-relevant. Edge cases include items that only ask about the mother (partially relevant if the searcher accepts parent-level data), or instruments that discuss church attendance or belief without specifying "Konfession" — those may be relevant for broader notions of religiosity but not for questions about denominational affiliation. Duplicate or noisy text (repeated lines) is still relevant if the substantive question and keywords are present, but should be de-duplicated for clarity.
15721	job	Collect detailed employment information about a person's first job after leaving full‑time education and their current (or most recent) job. This includes job type, full‑time/part‑time status, second jobs, reasons for temporary or part‑time work, skill requirements, job duration/number, and the job’s status compared with the respondent’s father.	A document is relevant to the query "job" when it contains substantive content about employment — for example survey questions asking which type of job a respondent had in their first job after leaving full‑time education, what their current or last job is, whether it is full‑ or part‑time, reasons for temporary or part‑time work, second jobs, job skills, or comparisons of job status with a parent. Conversely, a document is non‑relevant when it only mentions the word “job” in passing or in a different sense (e.g., “do the job,” computing batch jobs), or when it only contains unrelated material such as political performance questions or lists of variable codes without the accompanying questionnaire text. Edge cases include files that contain variable codes (v71, v72, Q23a, etc.) or repeated boilerplate: these may be borderline relevant if the actual question text about occupations is present, but less useful if they only show metadata or duplicates. Prioritize documents with clear survey items about occupation, employment status, duration, preferences, and reasons; deprioritize those that lack employment content or use “job” ambiguously.
15758	job satisfaction	Looking for survey questionnaire items and measures of job/work satisfaction — including overall satisfaction scales (0–10 and categorical), feelings of entitlement/deservedness, related satisfaction items (e.g., housewife, life, democracy), and linked job variables (current/first job type, occupation, full/part‑time and second jobs, skills, temporary job reasons, and status compared with father’s job).	This document is relevant because it explicitly contains multiple job- and work-satisfaction items and a named "work satisfaction scale," including direct survey wording like "On the whole are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your work" and a 0–10 satisfaction rating (0 = completely dissatisfied, 10 = very satisfied). It also includes related well‑being items (housewife satisfaction, life satisfaction) that can be useful when a broader view of job‑related happiness or comparative satisfaction across domains is desired. Parts of the text that focus on occupation classification — lists of job types, first job vs current job, full/part‑time status, and comparisons to a father’s job — are about job characteristics rather than satisfaction and are therefore non‑relevant for a strict "job satisfaction" query. Edge cases: documents that mention "satisfaction" but only about democracy or life satisfaction are only partially relevant unless the user wants multi‑domain measures; conversely, a page that only lists job titles without any evaluative questions would be non‑relevant despite being about jobs.
1635	depression	The user is looking for and comparing survey items and variable codes that measure self-reported depressive symptoms (e.g., "felt unhappy and depressed" in the past 4 weeks or "I was depressed/down" in the last week), timing of last episode, functional impairment from emotional problems (cut down activity, accomplish less, less careful, missed work), and help‑seeking preferences (who they'd turn to first/second). They want these items, response options, and variable names mapped across multiple surveys/instruments (e.g., ISSP, QA3/QA8, various V/v codes, parent reports) for harmonization or analysis.	A document is relevant when it contains survey items, variable labels, or questionnaire metadata that directly measure feeling "unhappy and depressed" or "depressed/down" (for example: "During the past 4 weeks how often have you felt unhappy and depressed" or "In the last week I was depressed/down" with listed response codes). Highly relevant documents also include follow-up help‑seeking questions ("Who would you turn to first/second if you felt a bit down?"), functional‑impairment items tied to emotional problems (cut down activity, accomplished less, missed work), or exact variable IDs (v55, Q16c, V41, v116, etc.). Moderately relevant material would discuss depression broadly (clinical criteria, treatment, or population prevalence) or contain questionnaire names (ISSP) without the specific item text or response scales; datasets that only list variable names but not question wording are borderline. Non‑relevant items are uses of "depression" in other domains (economic depression), documents about anxiety only, or texts that mention related words like "sad" without a defined time frame or response options. Edge cases include translated or paraphrased items (e.g., "unhappy" vs "depressed"), derived summary scores (a "depression_score" variable without its items), and instruments that change the recall window (last week vs past 4 weeks), all of which may be partially relevant depending on whether the original item text or mapping is present.
16523	klimaschutz	Seeking public opinions on climate protection in Germany — specifically whether the federal government, businesses and citizens are doing enough and how effective protests are — plus expectations for international talks (e.g., G8) and which political party best represents the respondent’s preferred climate policies.	A document is relevant to the keyword "Klimaschutz" if it substantively discusses climate protection—naming actors (Bundesregierung, G8, political parties, companies, citizens), describing policies or measures, reporting opinions or survey results, or situating actions in time (e.g., week numbers or summit dates). For example, a survey transcript asking whether the government is doing enough, a news report on G8 commitments, or a policy brief describing measures and responsibilities would be clearly relevant. A document is non-relevant if the word appears only incidentally (in a list, metadata tag, repeated template code like V267/V246, or as an isolated caption) or if the text is about an unrelated topic that merely mentions "Klimaschutz" once. Edge cases include repetitive survey question dumps that signal the topic but contain no substantive answers (partially relevant for intent detection but low informational value), and translations or snippets where meaning is ambiguous. In ranking, prioritize documents with concrete actions, outcomes, dates, or quantified opinions, and de-prioritize boilerplate, duplicate entries, or single-token occurrences.
1670	rassismus	The user seeks a clear explanation of racism, specifically how racial bias contributes to recent U.S. incidents of police violence and the resulting protests. They likely want to know causes, examples, and possible policy responses such as the proposed increased deployment of federal law enforcement.	A document is relevant to the keyword "rassismus" if it explicitly addresses racial discrimination, racial motivations or outcomes (for example police violence directed at racial minorities), or the social and political responses to such allegations. The provided paragraph — which links police violence, accusations of racism in the USA, protests, and the federal government’s decision to deploy federal police — is clearly relevant because it foregrounds race as a cause of unrest and policy reaction. A text that only mentions protests or law-and-order measures without connecting them to racial bias, or that uses the term "Rassismus" only rhetorically without substantive discussion, would be less relevant. Edge cases include articles that discuss racialized outcomes without using the word "rassismus" (still relevant), or opinion pieces that claim racism without evidence (relevant but weaker); language or topical shifts (e.g., discussing immigration or workplace bias rather than policing) change the degree but not necessarily the relevance.
17057	kinderbetreuung	A search for "kinderbetreuung" seeks information about childcare in Germany: the current situation, public opinions, responsibility for care, availability and policy issues (e.g., Betreuungsgeld, parental leave), and COVID-related impacts on schools and Kitas. It also covers related topics like time spent on housework and childcare, career interruptions for caregiving, concerns about misuse of childcare payments, and minor/mini-job employment involving childcare.	A document is relevant to the keyword "kinderbetreuung" if it directly addresses child care in Germany—e.g. surveys or policy texts asking who should provide care, how long parents interrupted paid work for childcare, Betreuungsgeld debates, hours spent on child care, or COVID-related school and daycare closures and reopenings. Highly relevant examples are questionnaires, government reports or research papers measuring parental leave, household division of care tasks, mini‑job descriptions that explicitly list childcare as a typical activity, or analyses of misuse concerns around Betreuungsgeld. Documents are non‑relevant when they only mention childcare tangentially (for instance as one item in a long unrelated list), focus strictly on unrelated household chores while explicitly excluding childcare, are mere metadata or duplicates, or discuss employment thresholds without any linkage to child care. Borderline cases include texts that list “childcare” as a brief example among many (these may be useful for context but offer little depth), or sources describing childcare in other countries or in an outdated legal/currency context (e.g. DM vs. EUR), which may require temporal or geographic filtering to judge true relevance.
1719	vertrauen	The user wants to measure or report levels of trust ("Vertrauen") in institutions — e.g., the Bundestag, courts, churches/religious organizations, health system, large private companies and public authorities — using a 0–10 rating scale. They need concise survey wording or a description of respondents' task to indicate how much trust they have in each institution.	A document is relevant to the keyword "vertrauen" if it explicitly treats trust—especially survey items or measures asking respondents to rate their trust in institutions (for example the Bundestag, courts, churches, authorities, health care or large private companies) or presents results from such questions; repeated survey prompts and the 0–10 trust scale in the paragraph are strong signals of relevance. Examples of clearly relevant content are questionnaires that ask "Wieviel Vertrauen haben Sie in...?" or tables showing average trust scores for V664 (Bundestag), V456 (behörden), V539 (Gesundheitswesen) and similar codes. It is non-relevant when the word appears incidentally (e.g., as part of a company name, in another language, as OCR/redundant template noise with no substantive data) or when the document discusses unrelated concepts that happen to contain the string "vertrauen." Edge cases include metadata or code lists (the V/J/I tags) — these are relevant if they accompany the survey item or results but borderline if they appear alone with no questionnaire context; likewise translated or summarized reports are relevant only if they retain the actual trust questions or numeric measures.
17717	kinderwunsch	The user wants documentation or a clear summary of survey variables about "Kinderwunsch" (reasons for not wanting children), i.e., the coded response categories (economic, health, contraception, career/self‑realization, childcare availability, societal attitudes, environment/peace fears, abortion law, egoism, etc.). They also need the variable coding scheme showing how responses are recorded (e.g., mentioned vs. not mentioned and special codes for non‑response/other).	A document is relevant to the keyword "kinderwunsch" when it explicitly addresses the desire for (or lack of desire for) children—especially when it lists survey variables or codebook entries like "Grund für nicht vorhandenen Kinderwunsch" (reasons for no desire to have children) and the S.Y2* codes. The paragraph is a strong match because it enumerates labeled categories (e.g., Egoismus, verbesserte Verhütungsmethoden, materielle/ökonomische Gründe, Berufstätigkeit der Frau, gesundheitliche Gründe, Kinderfeindlichkeit, Kindergartenplätze) and maps them to variable codes (S.Y2b, S.Y2f, S.Y2h, etc.), which is exactly the kind of structured content needed for analysis. It would be non-relevant if a document only mentions "Kinderwunsch" in a different sense (for example a fertility clinic or "Kinderwunschzentrum" offering treatments), or if it only contains unrelated administrative codes or general fertility statistics without reasons. Edge cases include texts that briefly mention items like "Liberalisierung des 218" (abortion law) — those may be partially relevant if they discuss how legal changes affect childbearing desires, but are less useful if the reference is incidental; repeated or "nicht erhoben" flags and duplicate lines reduce usefulness because they signal missing data or redundant metadata rather than substantive explanations.
1825	glaubwürdigkeit	The user is looking for public-opinion information on "Glaubwürdigkeit"—survey questions and (ideally) results about the credibility of German parties and politicians, specifically whether the CDU, SPD, Linke and figures like Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg and Kurt Beck are seen as more or less credible compared with the last state election.	A document is relevant when it explicitly addresses "Glaubwürdigkeit" as a trait of parties or politicians—for example opinion‑poll questions or analyses asking “Hat sich die Glaubwürdigkeit der SPD/CDU im Vergleich zur letzten Landtagswahl verbessert oder verschlechtert?” or reports that “Glaubwürdigkeit beschädigt” in reference to Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg. Concrete evidence such as survey results, trend comparisons over time, news about scandals that affect public trust, or direct questions about Kurt Beck’s credibility are strong relevance signals. Documents that merely contain the word as metadata, repeat transcript fragments, list names (e.g., “Guttenberg”) without linking them to credibility, or use the term in an unrelated sense (e.g., methodological credibility of a study) should be treated as non‑relevant or lower priority unless the user’s intent is broader. Edge cases include methodological pieces on how to measure "Glaubwürdigkeit" (potentially relevant for a research intent) and translations or paraphrases in German that preserve the focus on political trust, which should still be considered relevant. Prioritize items that directly discuss party/politician trust and poll questions, and downrank noise, duplicate lines, or off‑topic usages.
18263	mitarbeiter	The user is seeking whether someone was responsible for other employees and for how many (i.e., supervisory responsibility or number of staff supervised). This query is specifically in the context of former Stasi personnel — questions about prosecutions, candidacy in elections, and whether a spouse/partner held supervisory responsibility.	A document is relevant to the keyword "mitarbeiter" if it contains substantive information about employees — for example explicit questions or statements about how many employees someone was responsible for, supervisory duties, employment status, or mentions of individuals as employees (e.g., "Für wie viele Mitarbeiter waren Sie verantwortlich", "Befr. für Mitarbeiter verantwortlich", or "ehem. Stasi Mitarbeiter"). Passages that discuss roles, headcounts, partner/spouse involvement with employee duties, or legal/administrative treatment of staff (such as prosecution of former Stasi employees) are also pertinent. A document is non-relevant when "Mitarbeiter" appears only as boilerplate, repeated form labels, duplicated OCR noise, or in an unrelated sense (e.g., the different word "Mitarbeit") without addressing employees. Edge cases include abbreviations and concatenations ("Mitarb.", "Mitarbeiterverantwortlich"), mentions of a spouse’s responsibility (relevant only if the intent includes family links to staff), and misspellings or uppercasing — these should be normalized and judged by surrounding context to avoid false positives.
1851	education	The user needs standardized classifications of highest education level — including professional/further education and spouse/partner’s highest qualification — for survey coding or analysis. They specifically want country-specific mappings of degree categories for Finland, Taiwan, Ireland, Slovenia, Australia, Russia, the Philippines, Spain, Portugal, and Switzerland (DEGR03/2003 / Education II).	A document is relevant to the keyword "education" if it explicitly contains variables, questions, or mappings about educational attainment — for example labels like "professional education", "highest education level", "spouse degree highest qualification", or country-specific degree mappings such as DEGR03 for FI, TW, IE, etc. Items that show survey variable codes (v465, v501, DEGREE R, Education II) and repeated question text ("What is your professional education / further education") are strong signals of relevance because they directly encode or ask about qualifications and degrees. A document is non‑relevant if "education" appears only incidentally (e.g., in a generic header), if the text actually refers to unrelated training topics or job titles, or if the codes present map to non‑educational domains — such cases do not provide usable information about attainment levels. Edge cases to watch: duplicated or noisy listings, multilingual or abbreviated labels that obscure meaning, distinctions between respondent vs. spouse education, and dated country‑specific schemas (e.g., 2003) — these require careful interpretation even when the document is broadly about education.
18995	migrant	User needs a concise explanation of the survey variables classifying residents by migration status and direction (e.g., purely West/East, East–West commuters, migrants to/from East or West) from the Young Adults/1996 dataset. They also want a summary of the attitudinal survey item asking respondents whether they agree that migrants send money home to relatives (i.e., public views on remittances) and how that response is recorded.	A document is highly relevant to the query "migrant" when it contains substantive discussion of migration topics such as movement between regions (e.g., "East migrant to the West"), origin/destination details, migrants’ activities (working abroad), or remittances (e.g., "migrants … often send money back to their relatives"). Short survey labels or variable names that explicitly describe migrant-related measures (like "MIGRANTS SENDING BACK MONEY" or descriptions of region-of-origin categories) are also relevant because they indicate measured content about migrants. A document is less relevant when it only contains noisy metadata or repeated variable codes (NeuQ5, v406, NeuJE341) without explanatory text, or when "migrant" appears only as a tag or in passing with no substantive context. Edge cases include passages that mention "without migrants" — these can be relevant if they analyze impacts of migrant absence, but are borderline if they merely list a category name (e.g., "Purely East West without migrants") with no further information.
20168	muslime	A request to measure public perceptions of Muslims, especially regarding integration in Germany (e.g., acceptance of other religions, obedience to German law, preference for social separation, and perceived threat). It also seeks estimates (0–100 scale) of how widespread various opinions are among Muslims living in Germany and in Arab countries.	A document is relevant to the keyword "muslime" when it substantively discusses Muslims or public attitudes toward Muslims — for example survey questionnaires, opinion-poll results, sociological studies, news stories about Muslim communities in Germany or Arab countries, or policy analyses of integration and legal obligations. The paragraph you supplied, which contains repeated survey items asking how people perceive Muslims in Germany and Arab countries (e.g., whether they follow German law, accept other religions, or prefer to keep to themselves), is clearly relevant because it directly addresses those themes. A document is non-relevant if the term appears only fleetingly or in a different sense (for instance as a username, a brand name, or a transcription error), or if the piece is about an unrelated topic that merely mentions "Muslime" in passing. Edge cases include noisy or repetitive transcripts — even with duplication or transcription artifacts they remain relevant if they contain the survey content or substantive statements about Muslims, whereas materials that reproduce stereotypes or hate speech without analysis may be relevant but require careful handling or content warnings.
20775	mobilität	The user is asking about mobility limitations — imagining future age- or accident-related loss of movement — and how this would affect preferred housing choices and the need for assistance. They want to know whether they would require temporary or long-term help with daily activities (personal care, eating, mobility/ambulation, and household tasks) due to illness, disability, or age.	A document is relevant to the query "mobilität" if it discusses personal physical mobility and its consequences — for example preferred housing when one’s Bewegungsfreiheit is eingeschränkt, questions about Hilfs- oder Pflegebedürftigkeit, or needs for help with daily living tasks (Körperpflege, Ernährung, Mobilität, hauswirtschaftliche Versorgung). Survey items like the repeated questionnaire text in the paragraph, descriptions of accessibility features, assistive devices, adaptations to dwellings, or assessments of long‑term care needs are clear positive signals. Non‑relevant documents mention "mobility" in other senses (transportation policy, workforce or social mobility, semiconductor electron mobility) or only use the word briefly without relating it to personal care, housing or ADLs. Borderline cases include texts that use "mobilität" in relation to moving house or short‑term travel — these may be partially relevant if they explicitly address movement restrictions or care needs, but irrelevant if they only discuss logistics or abstract concepts.
21196	motivation	User seeks to know which incentives or assurances would encourage people to take part in public discussions about the future of Europe (e.g., being taken seriously, anonymity, access to information, same language, etc.).  
They also want to identify main motivations for learning additional foreign languages (e.g., work or study abroad, better job, travel/holidays, meeting people, heritage, internet use, personal satisfaction).	A document is relevant to the keyword "motivation" when it explicitly records reasons, incentives or barriers that would make someone take part in an activity (e.g., public discussions) or learn another language. For example, responses that say "being certain my views are taken seriously," "anonymity," "access to information," or "same language" directly capture motivations for joining public debates, while labels like "nothing" or "don't know" also count as meaningful (they indicate no or unclear motivation). For language learning, relevant documents list concrete motives such as "better job," "study abroad," "holiday/travel," "meet people," "heritage," "personal satisfaction," or using the Internet to learn. Non-relevant documents lack motivational content—pure metadata, admin codes, unrelated survey modules, or repeated question stems with no answer give no insight into motivation. Edge cases include files that only contain variable names or the substring "motiv" (these can be useful if they map to response labels) and responses that state "nothing" or "know enough," which are relevant but indicate absence of motivation rather than a positive driver.
2160	beruf	The user is looking for guidance and survey wording about "Beruf" (occupation): how to report current or most recent occupation, the occupations of father and grandfathers, the respondent’s job status/position, questions on combining work and family, and how to compare the occupational status with that of the father at age 15.	A document is relevant to the keyword "beruf" if it contains substantive content about occupations or professional status — for example survey questions asking "Welchen Beruf haben Sie zuletzt ausgeübt?", descriptions of someone's current or last job, questions about the father's or grandfathers' occupations, or discussion of work–family compatibility and "Stellung im Beruf." Explicit phrases in the paragraph such as "Beruf des Vaters," "Zur Zeit ausgeübter Beruf," "Beruf und Familie," and forms of berufstätig/beruflicher Status are strong signals of relevance. Non-relevant items are entries that only include the string "Beruf" in codes, index headings, file labels, repeated OCR fragments, or page references (e.g. "v238 S.6" or "V206 VEREINB. FAMILIE BERUF") without substantive text about jobs. Borderline cases include specialized terms like "Berufsstellung des HVV" (which may be relevant only if the user seeks that organization or a legal/regulatory meaning) and metadata tags such as "VEREINB. FAMILIE BERUF" that suggest topical relevance but require inspection of the actual content to confirm.
21846	links rechts	The query seeks survey/questions wording about political self-placement on a left–right ideological scale (e.g., 0–10 or 1–11) and related bipolar items asking respondents to rate how left or right certain attributes apply, including comparisons between East and West Germans. The information need is to find or understand survey items that measure respondents' ideological position and perceptions of regional political/cultural differences.	A document is relevant if it clearly contains German survey or questionnaire content about political self-placement on a left–right spectrum — e.g., it uses the terms "links" and "rechts" together with words like "Selbsteinstufung", "Einstufung", "Kontinuum", explicit scales (0–10, 1–11), response instructions ("Bitte kreuzen", "Bitte markieren") or variable IDs (V775, V210, etc.). Good examples are codebooks, survey questionnaires or dataset entries that ask "Where would you place yourself on a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = left, 10 = right)?" or bipolar adjective grids comparing Ost/West Germans. Non-relevant documents mention "links" and "rechts" in other senses (physical directions, hyperlinks/links, legal terms, neurological left/right brain, or surnames) or only incidental occurrences with no political scale or self-placement context. Edge cases include noisy or duplicated texts: repeated variable codes and question fragments are still relevant if the core left–right self-placement question appears, but pages that only list variable names without question wording or that mix languages without clear political context are less useful.
21879	links rechts skala	The user is looking for survey question wording and scale formats for measuring political ideology on a left–right continuum. Specifically, they want examples of items asking respondents to place themselves or political parties on numeric scales (e.g., 0–10 or 1–11) from left to right.	A document is relevant if it includes German survey items asking respondents to place themselves or specific parties (e.g., AfD, SPD, GRÜNE, FDP, CDU, CSU) on a left–right numeric scale, especially when it reproduces scale anchors like 0–10 or 1–11 and variable IDs (V775, V260, pa22, pa25, etc.). Typical relevant sources are questionnaire forms, dataset codebooks, survey instrument descriptions or data files that show the exact wording, response scales, and party-list items. Documents are not relevant when "links" and "rechts" are used as physical directions, hyperlinks, legal terms, or when the text discusses politics only qualitatively without a numeric left–right self-placement or party-placement scale. Edge cases include German-language analyses that describe the concept without reproducing the scale (borderline), translations into other languages (less directly relevant), or instruments using a different ideological axis (e.g., libertarian–authoritarian) — these may be partially relevant but score lower unless they match the exact scale, parties, or variable codes.
221	immigration	A user is looking for survey questions or public‑opinion measures about attitudes toward immigrants, covering acceptance and perceived impacts — cultural assimilation, effects on the economy and jobs, crime, illegal immigration — and opinions about immigrants from specific regions (EU, Eastern Europe, south of the Mediterranean) and asylum seekers.	A document is relevant when it contains survey items, variable codes, or question text about public attitudes toward immigrants—especially the explicit Q9/qa9 items (e.g., “Q9a Immigrants increase crime rates,” “qa9 1 positive for nat economy,” “Q9e undermines culture”) or origin-specific variables (v317/v318/v316/v315 referencing EU, Eastern European, South‑of‑Mediterranean immigrants or asylum seekers). Relevant examples include interview scripts asking “How much do you agree or disagree…”, multiple‑choice items about whether immigrants should retain or adopt COUNTRY’s culture, and statements about jobs, welfare, crime, culture, illegal immigration, or economic impact. Non‑relevant documents mention “immigration” only tangentially (e.g., historical migration flows, animal migration, pure demographic counts) or focus on policy/legal text without attitudinal questions; duplicates, formatting noise, or unrelated “R’s country” placeholders with no survey content are low value. Edge cases: translated or templated forms that use placeholders like COUNTRY or R can still be highly relevant if they reproduce the exact Q9/qa9 wording or variable codes, whereas pieces that discuss crime statistics without connecting them to opinions about immigrants are borderline. Documents containing multiple matching items or the original variable codes and full question wording should be scored highest for relevance.
22708	media use	User is looking for how people use different media (television, radio, newspapers, internet websites, and social/online media) for news—specifically which medium they use most often (first and second choices), summary variables, and frequency of using media for political news. They also want perceptions of how the media cover poverty and social exclusion, with references to survey variables (qp16a/b/t, v532, V25, v467/Q94) that record those responses.	A document is relevant to the query "media use" when it explicitly addresses how people consume media (television, radio, newspapers/printed press, internet websites, online social media), especially items about which medium is used most often (firstly/secondly), frequency of using media for political news, or survey variables and codebooks that record those responses (e.g., QP16A/QP16B, v532, qp16t summaries). Examples of relevant content include a survey questionnaire listing "Which media do you use most often? Firstly and then…", datasets or tables showing TV vs. social media usage, methodological notes on how media-use indices were computed, or analyses of how media cover poverty and social exclusion. Non-relevant documents include texts that mention “media” in unrelated contexts (e.g., biological growth media, advertising strategy without news-consumption focus), random metadata or filenames, or pages that only repeat variable codes without any mapping or descriptions — though code-only files become relevant if they include a codebook explaining the variables. Edge cases to watch for are short or ambiguous abbreviations (QP16A/B, DK) that require a legend to confirm relevance, near-duplicates or noisy repeated text that signal low-quality extraction, and multilingual variants that remain relevant if they clearly document media-use questions or findings.
2272	work life balance	A concise summary of priorities and perceptions: identify which measures (e.g., reduced working hours, flexible hours, childcare facilities, parental/maternity/paternity leave, company measures, sharing household tasks, or none/other) people consider most important to improve the balance between family and work. Also assess whether women feel they have benefited or will benefit from EU/EC policies and programmes in their personal or professional lives, and explain why or why not.	A document is relevant to the query “work life balance” when it directly addresses measures to help men and women balance family and professional life — for example discussing reduced working hours, childcare/care facilities, flexible working hours, parental/maternity/paternity leave, sharing household tasks, or company-level measures — or when it evaluates whether EU/EC policies have benefited women in this respect. Survey answers that explicitly state which measures should be a priority or give reasons why EC policies help (or do not help) are clearly relevant because they provide opinions and evidence about preferred solutions. Documents that are non-relevant include those that only contain repeated question text, isolated code labels (v244, v240, etc.) or metadata with no substantive responses, or texts that treat “work-life” only as a productivity or financial term without the family/household dimension. Edge cases include questionnaires that are relevant for capturing attitudes but not for causal analysis, and ambiguous mentions of “flexible working” that refer to unrelated concepts (e.g., flexible capital or hours in a different sector) — such cases require reading context to decide relevance. For example, a report showing respondents prioritize flexible hours and childcare is highly relevant, whereas a file listing variable codes with no answers is not.
23614	medien nutzung	The user wants to capture how people use and perceive media — frequency and channels for political information, trust and fairness in coverage of public figures and scandals, use of social media as a news source, engagement with authorities/media, and related attitudes (e.g., copyright, local issues like land use). This information need likely supports analyzing survey responses or designing a questionnaire about media consumption and opinions.	A document is relevant to the keyword "medien nutzung" if it explicitly addresses how people use media (types and frequency), for example survey items asking "Wie oft nutzen Sie die Medien (Fernsehen, Zeitungen, Radio, Internet) um sich politisch zu informieren" or "An wie vielen Tagen in der Woche nutzen Sie soziale Medien, Blogs und Foren ...". Text that lists channels (TV, newspapers, radio, internet, social media), measures of use (days per week, frequency), or questions about using media for political information or education is a strong match. Documents that focus on unrelated topics — e.g., brown‑coal mining, land‑use decisions, or legal cases about individuals — are not relevant unless they also report on audience consumption patterns or public reactions. Edge cases include pieces about media coverage of specific figures (Wulff, Friedman) or about copyright on platforms: these are relevant only when they include survey questions, usage statistics, or discussion of how audiences access and use media; mere event reporting or legal argumentation without user‑behavior content is non‑relevant.
2386	politische einstellung	The user wants a concise survey question to measure political ideology by asking respondents to place their own views on a left–right scale. They also intend related items about respondents' attitudes toward people from different religious groups.	A document is relevant to the query "politische einstellung" when it explicitly addresses political orientation or a left–right self-placement question — for example survey items that ask "Wo würden Sie Ihre eigenen politischen Ansichten einstufen?" or instrument metadata/variable labels like pa01, po01, or v54 that map to a left–right scale. Relevant documents include questionnaire text, coding instructions, response scales (e.g. "Wir haben hier einen Maßstab der von links nach rechts verläuft"), or dataset fields that record respondents' political self-placement. Non-relevant materials mention politics only tangentially (news reports about parties or policies, biographical notes about politicians) or use "Einstellung" in a non-political sense (e.g. technical settings, product preferences) — these do not match the intent of measuring individual political attitude. Edge cases include documents using synonyms or other languages ("political orientation", "left-right scale", "self-placement") which are relevant, and texts about attitudes toward social groups (e.g. "Einstellung zu Menschen aus folgenden Religionsgruppen") which may be related but are only partially relevant unless explicitly tied to political ideology; likewise, repeated boilerplate or duplicated question strings indicate a questionnaire instrument (highly relevant) but add little extra value without unique wording or metadata.
23986	ungleichheit	The user wants to find and understand how "Ungleichheit" (social inequality) is represented in a German survey asking respondents for the three biggest problems in Germany — specifically where "Soziale Ungleichheit / Gefälle" appears among the coded response categories (F.59, V271/SPSS) and how to locate, interpret, and analyse its occurrence in the data.	A document is relevant to the keyword "ungleichheit" when it explicitly discusses social or economic inequality (for example the entry "Soziale Ungleichheit Gefälle" or related items like "Neue Armut", "Löhne zu niedrig", "Renten" or "Ungleiche Lebensverhältnisse Ost West") or uses clear synonyms and examples of unequal outcomes. The paragraph you provided contains several direct markers of relevance (code 007 for social inequality, code 063 for unequal living conditions East–West, plus many items—housing, wages, poverty—that are typical drivers or measures of inequality). It is non‑relevant if the document only lists unrelated problems (e.g. "Rechtschreibreform", "Atomkraft", "Benzinpreis") or if "ungleichheit" only appears as an incidental label in a code list without substantive discussion. Edge cases include texts that imply inequality through topics like rents, unemployment, or pension stress—these should be treated as relevant if they analyze disparities, but excluded if they merely enumerate items without linking them to unequal distribution; also beware false positives from mathematical uses of "Ungleichung" or from translations that change meaning.
24946	umweltschutz	The user is looking for information about public attitudes and responsibility for environmental protection (Umweltschutz)—specifically who (EU, state governments, or political parties such as SPD, CDU, Greens) is seen as most capable of ensuring effective environmental protection, assessments of state governments’ performance, and whether the situation has changed since last autumn. They likely want survey-style questions or results comparing parties and regional governments (e.g., Saarland, Niedersachsen, Nordrhein-Westfalen) on effective environmental protection.	A document is relevant to the query "umweltschutz" when the keyword is the central subject and the text discusses concrete aspects like policies, solutions, responsible actors, or measures — for example, passages asking which party can provide "wirksamen Umweltschutz" or referring to "Loesung Umweltschutz" and "W. VERBESSERT UMWELTSCH." are highly relevant. Relevance is also determined by scope: items that treat EU-level obligations ("EU Aufgabe Umweltschutz"), state/regional implementation (Saarland, Niedersachsen, Nordrhein‑Westfalen), or concrete improvements score higher than passing mentions. A document is non‑relevant if the term appears only incidentally, as noise or metadata (e.g., repeated codes like v53, V267), or in unrelated contexts (homonyms, OCR artifacts), or if it is mostly duplicated questionnaire prompts with no substantive content. Edge cases include political‑focus texts that mention parties often but contain few policy details (politically relevant but substantively weak), translations or dated notes (e.g., "since last autumn") that affect timeliness, and documents in other languages or heavily redacted items that may require additional processing to confirm relevance.
2500	violence	A concise summary of survey items and variables about violence, specifically public perceptions of who is likely to inflict violence on children (parents, relatives, siblings, other children, teachers/childminders, strangers), whether violence is geographically concentrated or national, acceptance of domestic violence against women and men, and the extent of post‑election violence. The information need is to identify and analyze attitudes and reported patterns of violence (perpetrators, geographic spread, and social acceptance) for research or monitoring.	A document is relevant to the keyword "violence" when it explicitly discusses violent acts, perpetrators, victims, or contexts—for example entries like "VIOL AG CHILDR BY STRANGER," "DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN," or "POST ELECTION VIOLENCE" clearly match. It is especially useful if the text describes types of violence (child abuse, domestic, post‑election), who perpetrates it (partner, teacher, sibling, stranger), where it occurs (geographic concentration), or attitudes toward violence (acceptance questions). A document is less relevant if it only mentions "violence" peripherally, uses the term metaphorically (e.g., "violent storm"), or contains only opaque codes/labels without explanatory content. Edge cases include structured survey metadata that lists variables like v322–v329: these are likely relevant because they index violence topics, but they may be low value if you need incident narratives or prevalence data rather than variable names; duplicated lines or repeated question stems add little new information. Finally, check the user’s intent—seeking incident reports, survey measures, or attitudinal items will change which documents are most relevant.
2585	kriminalität	User is looking for information about public perceptions of crime — specifically whether people feel threatened by crime, whether they expect more crime because of refugees, and whether crime-fighting efforts are sufficient. They likely need survey question wording or aggregated attitudinal data on these topics.	A document is relevant to the keyword "kriminalität" when it explicitly discusses crime — for example survey questions like "Fühlen Sie sich durch Kriminalität bedroht?", items about crime prevention ("Kriminalitätsbekämpfung genug") or expectations that refugees will increase crime. High relevance comes from the word appearing in the main question text, repeated survey items or variable labels (V###) that capture perceptions or policy attitudes about crime. Documents that only mention "Kriminalität" in passing, bury it in unrelated metadata (e.g., week numbers, "Zu einem anderen Thema"), or use it as a tag without substantive content are not relevant. Edge cases include pieces that discuss crime in a different sense (historical, legal definitions) or use synonyms like "Verbrechen"/"Straftat" — these can be relevant depending on whether the user seeks perception-focused survey items or broader crime discussion. Also note sensitive subtopics (e.g., linking "Flüchtlinge" to crime) are relevant to the keyword but may require careful handling for bias and context.
26363	verkehrsmittel	The user is looking to identify which transport mode(s) people use to travel to work or school — specifically the main (primary) mode, any additional modes, the mode used for the longest part of the trip, and the mode used on the outbound (Hinweg) journey. This is for classifying or recording commute modes such as walking, bicycle, car, bus, tram, train, or motorcycle.	A document is relevant when it explicitly discusses "Verkehrsmittel" or synonymous phrases in the context of commuting (e.g., Verkehrsmittelwahl auf Arbeitsweg, Hinweg, für die längste Wegstrecke) and lists or asks about specific modes such as Auto, Bus, Fahrrad, Eisenbahn, Straßenbahn, Motorrad/Moped, or "Keine Verkehrsmittel" (walk). For example, survey items like "Und welches Verkehrsmittel benutzen Sie da hauptsächlich" or records tagged EF134/EF194 that link a transport mode to Arbeitsstätte/Schule are highly relevant because they directly capture mode choice. Documents are non-relevant if they mention vehicles only in unrelated contexts (freight logistics, vehicle maintenance, traffic law), contain only opaque codes with no mode mapping, or are mere duplicates without new content. Edge cases include entries labeled "weitere Verkehrsmittel" (which requires inspection to see what additional modes are meant), "Keine Verkehrsmittel" (which may imply walking), region-specific tags like HVV or DC1800P (which increase relevance if the query targets that system), and partial fragments that nonetheless contain the primary-mode question—these should be considered potentially relevant but may need disambiguation.
2662	politische orientierung	The user wants to know the political orientation and current/future political direction of actors such as the CDU/CSU, SPD and Greens, and of the EU — e.g., whether the CDU is moving left and whether parties should cooperate. They also seek comparisons of political conditions in the former GDR versus today and public tolerance toward people with different political views.	A document is relevant to the query "politische orientierung" if it discusses the ideological direction or alignment of actors (parties, groups, or individuals), asks or reports whether a party is shifting left/right, or records people’s self-described political orientation and attitudes toward cooperation. For example, items like "CDU politically developing to the left," questions about whether the Greens or CDU/CSU should seek closer cooperation, or survey questions on tolerance for politically different opinions directly match the query. Documents that are non-relevant include noisy metadata and repeated codes (e.g., V288, V235), administrative labels (municipality size class) or datasets that only list technical sampling information without ideological content. Edge cases: texts about the EU’s future or DDR comparisons are relevant only when they treat ideological/political orientation (not purely economic or historical descriptions); survey question wording is useful, but raw response matrices or purely procedural documentation are less valuable.
2741	sport	The user needs a concise summary of survey items about sport and physical activity, covering how often people exercise, where they do it, attitudes toward sport (e.g., too much sport on TV, whether sport brings groups together), and perceived benefits (health, social ties, character building, helping disadvantaged). This information would support designing or analyzing a questionnaire on participation, venues, opinions, and outcomes of sport.	A document is relevant to the keyword "sport" when it explicitly addresses physical activity or organized sports — for example by asking how often people exercise, listing venues (fitness centre, sports club, park, at home, at work, school), or discussing perceived benefits and opinions (improved health, meeting other cultures, “too much sport on TV”). Concrete survey items, variable codes (qd7, v199, Q12b, etc.), and repeated question text in the paragraph indicate strong topical focus and make the document highly relevant for queries about sport participation, venues, attitudes, or health outcomes. A document is non‑relevant if the word “sport” appears only metaphorically, in an unrelated industry name, or when the content is about TV programming logistics without any link to physical activity or sport participation. Edge cases include materials that are highly relevant for research (questionnaire forms, variable lists) but low in narrative content, ambiguous usages like “e‑sport” or brand names that may not match the user’s intent, and documents that only discuss elite spectator events — relevant topically but focusing on a different facet of “sport.”
28540	worklife balance	Someone searching for "worklife balance" wants practical guidance on managing and harmonizing professional responsibilities with personal life and wellbeing, including time-management techniques, boundary-setting, and stress-reduction strategies. They may also be looking for employer policies and best practices (e.g., flexible hours, remote work), evidence of benefits, and relevant legal or organisational rights.	A document is relevant to the query "worklife balance" if it directly addresses the balance between paid work and personal/family life — for example by describing flexible hours, remote work policies, parental leave, childcare provision, overtime, employee wellbeing, or measures and outcomes (surveys, incidence of burnout, productivity effects). Research papers comparing parental leave across countries, employer guidelines on flexible working, or surveys reporting how many people work long hours would be relevant; so would case studies of interventions that improved employees’ ability to manage work and home. The paragraph provided — a repeated set of survey prompts about EU membership, environmental effort, and gender balance on company boards — is not relevant because it focuses on political membership and environmental or governance questions rather than working hours, leave, or workplace policies; only if a section explicitly links board gender balance or EU policy to childcare/leave arrangements would it become tangentially relevant. Edge cases include documents that mention "work" or "life" only in passing (not relevant) and pieces about related socioeconomic topics (e.g., labor law, productivity, gender equality) which are relevant only when they specifically discuss mechanisms or outcomes that affect individuals’ ability to combine work and personal life.
2884	fremdenfeindlichkeit	The user wants a definition and explanation of xenophobia in Germany and information about how widespread it is, including public perceptions and prevalence of anti-foreigner attitudes and incidents.	A document is relevant to the keyword "fremdenfeindlichkeit" if it explicitly discusses xenophobia—its definition, causes, prevalence or specific incidents in Germany—using data, news reporting, studies, legal analysis, policy responses, or first‑hand testimony. Examples of highly relevant content include government or NGO reports on hate crimes, academic articles measuring anti‑immigrant attitudes in German surveys, news stories about attacks on migrants, and legal commentary on statutes addressing xenophobic acts. Documents that only mention the term in passing, repeat a question like "Was meinen Sie ist Fremdenfeindlichkeit...?" without elaboration, or use similarly spelled but unrelated words (e.g., "Fremdenverkehr" meaning tourism) are not relevant. Edge cases include forum posts and opinion pieces—these can be relevant if they provide concrete examples or insight but are weaker than empirical studies—and English analyses or comparative research that focus on xenophobia in Germany are relevant even when the German term is translated. Finally, metadata tags or repeated codes (e.g., V174, V190) without substantive text are insufficient to establish relevance.
2911	happiness	The user is looking for survey items and measures to assess personal happiness and its causes. Specifically they want questions about current overall happiness (very/fairly/not too), recent feelings of happiness, whether one needs a family to be happy, and ranking key factors (good health, children, a successful marriage).	This paragraph is highly relevant to the keyword "happiness" because it contains many explicit mentions (including spelling variants like "happyness") and multiple direct survey items asking about being happy, felt happy in the past month, and whether family, health, children, or marriage are important for happiness. It is particularly useful if the user is looking for survey questions, instruments, or data-gathering language about subjective well‑being and related domains (mental health, overall life satisfaction). However, large amounts of repeated text and metadata tokens (v84, Q226, fn01, etc.) add noise and reduce the document’s informational value for someone seeking theory, analysis, or empirical findings. Edge cases: if the searcher wants philosophical definitions or statistical results on happiness, this paragraph is only partially relevant; if they want questionnaire items or examples of prompts, it is ideal. For ranking, boost documents with substantive discussion or results about happiness and de‑prioritize those that are mainly duplicated lines or metadata.
29207	zufriedenheit ausbildung	The user is looking for information about satisfaction with education and vocational training (Ausbildung), typically to measure how satisfied people are with their own, their partner’s or their children’s schooling and training. They likely want to link satisfaction to respondents’ general school-leaving qualification, family background and views on which government (SPD/FDP vs. CDU/CSU) could best improve vocational education.	This document is relevant if it directly addresses “Zufriedenheit” (satisfaction) with “Ausbildung” (education/training) or contains survey questions measuring respondents’ contentment with current vocational or school-based education. For example, items asking which education you would want for your children, whether your children have completed training, or whether the government (SPD/FDP vs. CDU/CSU) can improve vocational training are clearly on-topic because they probe satisfaction or perceived competence of the system. It is non-relevant when the text only lists administrative variable codes (V173, V230, etc.) or repeats prompts about general school-leaving certificates without any attitude or satisfaction measure. Edge cases include German-language prompts that inquire “wie es zurzeit ist” (how it is currently) or ask about improvements—these are relevant because they imply evaluative judgment—whereas political preference questions are only relevant if they explicitly link to respondents’ satisfaction with Ausbildung. Note that heavy duplication and template-like repetition reduces the document’s usefulness for assessing distinctive satisfaction content, though variable labels can still help map questions in a survey instrument.
29262	zufriedenheit arbeit	Looking for information on "zufriedenheit arbeit" (job/work satisfaction): the user wants to know how work satisfaction is defined and measured (e.g., survey items like wanting to work even if not seeking work, frequency of time pressure, collaboration with others) and which factors — including workplace conditions and public policies — influence or improve employees' satisfaction.	A document is relevant to the keyword "zufriedenheit arbeit" if it directly addresses job or employment satisfaction — for example survey questions or variables about how often people work under time pressure, whether they would like to work even if not seeking a job, satisfaction with their work, or collaboration with other self‑employed people in a work network. The paragraph contains some of these relevant items (e.g., "Wie oft arbeiten Sie bei der Erledigung Ihrer Arbeit unter Zeitdruck" and "Auch wenn Sie keine Arbeit suchen würden Sie dennoch gerne arbeiten"), so passages centered on those questions are pertinent. It is not relevant when the text is mainly about which party or government can solve federal budget, pensions, unemployment or broader economic problems (CDU/SPD competence, Bundeshaushalt, Terrorismusbekämpfung), unless those items explicitly link to individual job satisfaction or working conditions. Edge cases include mentions of "Zufriedenheit" that refer to satisfaction with government performance on employment policy — these are borderline relevant if the user’s intent includes satisfaction with employment policies rather than personal workplace satisfaction.
29421	zufriedenheit	A request to determine which government (federal or state) or party/coalition respondents think is best able to solve public problems to their satisfaction. It asks for satisfaction judgments across issues such as the federal budget, unemployment, the economy, debt reduction, pensions, price stability, environmental protection, agriculture and counter‑terrorism.	This document is highly relevant because it repeatedly contains the phrase "zu Ihrer Zufriedenheit" and asks who could best solve problems "to your satisfaction," so it directly targets the concept queried by "zufriedenheit." It is a survey instrument focusing on satisfaction with government performance across many policy areas — e.g., federal budget consolidation, unemployment, economy, agriculture, environmental protection, price stability, pensions and debt — so any query about satisfaction with public problem‑solving would find concrete, topical examples here. Caveats: the text is question wording rather than measured satisfaction scores, and it contains many variable codes and duplicated lines (V116, v32, etc.), which is noisy and makes it less useful if you want survey results, analytical discussion, or theory of satisfaction. Edge cases that would be non‑relevant include documents that only mention "Zufriedenheit" in unrelated contexts (product or personal satisfaction), documents that use only a code or index label without human‑readable wording, or material in a different language if you require English. In short, this paragraph is relevant when you need examples of survey questions about citizens' satisfaction with government action, but less so if you need outcomes, summaries, or conceptual definitions of satisfaction.
2945	life satisfaction	A search for "life satisfaction" seeks examples of survey questions and measurement scales used to assess overall and domain-specific satisfaction (e.g., 0–10 or 1–10 scales for life as a whole, work, housewife role, and satisfaction with democracy). The user likely wants the exact question wording and related items about which life domains matter (health, finances, housing, community, transport, culture), feelings of entitlement to satisfaction, political influence on life, and the role of lifelong learning.	A document is relevant to the query "life satisfaction" when it contains an explicit question or measure asking respondents about their satisfaction with life as a whole (for example "All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole?" or a 1–10 satisfaction card such as EVS5/WVS7). Materials that record numeric or ordinal life‑satisfaction responses, or include clearly labeled scales (0–10, 1–10, or "very/fairly/not very/not at all satisfied") are directly useful. Documents that only report satisfaction for specific domains (work, health, housing, finances, community) are conditionally relevant if those domain scores are used to construct or explain overall life satisfaction, but an isolated domain item (e.g., only "work satisfaction") may be non‑relevant if the user needs a global life‑satisfaction measure. Non‑relevant items include mentions of "satisfaction" tied solely to other concepts (how democracy is working, political influence, or learning improves personal life) or files that only contain variable codes/metadata without the question text or response scale. Edge cases to watch: near‑duplicates or variant stems (entitlement-based wording like "should be entitled to" vs experienced satisfaction) affect comparability and should be treated as distinct measures unless explicitly harmonized.
30368	work	User wants information about employment and job characteristics for survey or coding purposes. Specifically they need details on current/former paid work, precise occupation title, employer size and number of paid/salaried employees and supervisees, usual weekly hours, and related items (e.g., summer holiday work or father's occupation).	A document is relevant to the query "work" when it explicitly concerns employment or workplace attributes — for example questions or variables about occupation, whether someone is currently working for pay, hours usually worked weekly, company size, number of paid or salaried employees, and supervisory counts. Concrete matches in this paragraph include items like "How many salaried people are working where you work," "Are you currently working for pay," and "Working hours number of hours usually worked weekly," which directly address labor and workplace measurement. Documents are not relevant when "work" appears in unrelated senses (physics/energy work, homework, or as part of another word), or when only opaque metadata or repeated codes (v1321, v418) occur with no substantive question text. Edge cases include mixed survey items such as "Did you spend your summer holiday... working" (relevant for youth or seasonal work analyses but less so for formal employment statistics) and multilingual or abbreviated forms of items that require mapping to the same employment concept. Finally, relevance depends on user intent: if the user wants every occurrence of the token "work" include broadly, but if they want employment-related documents restrict to items that clearly measure jobs, hours, company size, or pay.
31054	schule	The user wants an overview of survey questions and public opinions about schools in Germany. Specifically they are seeking information on current attendance (self or children), school type and completion, views on student violence and grade retention, teaching of economic topics, and COVID-related issues like school closures and remote learning.	A document is relevant to the keyword "schule" when it directly discusses schools or schooling—explicit occurrences of "Schule" or "Schulen", questions about attending school, types of schools (e.g., Grundschule, Hochschule), school policy, or events affecting schools (like closures). For example, the paragraph contains many clear relevance signals: repeated survey items such as "Besuchen Sie gegenwärtig eine Schule...", questions about children attending school, references to "Schulbildung" and the Corona-related school closures. Edge cases that should still count as relevant include morphological and compound forms (Schulen, Schulbildung, Hochschulen), while false positives arise when the string appears inside a proper name, surname, or an unrelated idiom. Documents that merely mention "Schule" once in passing, are in another language without translation, or are low-quality duplicates/metadata (repeated survey codes or verbatim prompts) may be technically relevant but less useful depending on the user’s intent (for example, someone seeking information about primary schools might find university references irrelevant).
3107	drugs	Someone looking for this wants survey-style information about people’s experiences with and perceptions of drug problems in their area — how often they encounter drug use or related paraphernalia, whether they personally know addicts, and whether drugs are seen as a workplace issue. They also want attitudes about availability and danger of specific drugs (e.g., ecstasy, heroin, cannabis) and whether drug addiction is viewed mainly as a social, health, economic, criminal, or moral problem.	A document is relevant to the query "drugs" when it directly discusses drug-related topics such as substance types (e.g., heroin, ecstasy, cannabis), patterns of use, availability, public contact with drug problems, addiction impacts (health, social, economic, moral, criminal), workplace concerns, or survey questions and statistics about these issues. For example, a questionnaire that asks how often people saw drug dealing, how easy it is to get particular drugs, or whether drug addiction is seen as an important workplace problem (like the provided paragraph) is clearly highly relevant. A document is non-relevant if it only mentions "drugs" in passing, uses the word metaphorically, or deals solely with unrelated pharmaceutical technicalities (e.g., dosing guidelines for prescribed medications) without addressing substance use or policy. Edge cases include medical documents about prescription drugs that may be relevant if they cover misuse or diversion, and lists of drug names with no context (low relevance) or duplicate/templated survey items (relevant but lower informational value); assessing depth and focus (detailed analysis vs. single mentions) helps determine final relevance.
31126	schichtarbeit	A survey question asking whether the respondent worked shift work between February and April, which specific shift types they worked (early/Frühschicht, late/Spätschicht, night/Nachtschicht, day/Tagschicht, or other/split shifts), and the reasons why they work in shift schedules. The goal is to record shift participation and motivations for working shifts.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses "Schichtarbeit" (shift work) or the specific survey items and codes shown — for example EF158, EF105–EF112 — and lists the shift types (Frühschicht, Spätschicht, Nachtschicht, Tagschicht, Sonstige) or asks for reasons for working shifts or whether the respondent worked in the Feb–Apr period. It is non-relevant when it does not mention shift work or those codes, only treats unrelated employment topics, uses a different time window, or only uses the English phrase "shift work" without connection to the same survey structure. Partial matches (edge cases) include documents that mention one or two shift types but not the survey questions, templates that contain the question IDs but no substantive content, or translations where terminology differs (e.g., "split shifts" vs. "geteilte Arbeitszeit") — these may be partially relevant depending on whether you need exact codes or just conceptual matches. Finally, documents that contain respondent answers to those exact questions (e.g., selected shifts or stated reasons) are highly relevant, whereas statistical summaries or commentary about shift work that do not map back to the listed items are less relevant.
3125	arbeitslosigkeit	The user is looking for public-opinion survey content about unemployment in Germany (Arbeitslosigkeit), including general attitudes, who is to blame (especially for East German unemployment), which actors can best reduce it (state, unions, employers), reactions to policy changes (e.g., introduction of the Euro) and specific measures (like cutting overtime), and how people would feel if personally unemployed.	This document is highly relevant to the query "arbeitslosigkeit" because it repeatedly mentions Arbeitslosigkeit and contains many questions and prompts about causes, who is to blame, policy measures (e.g., reducing overtime), regional issues (East Germany), and effects such as feelings during unemployment. It appears to be a survey instrument or questionnaire (note the variable codes like V204, repeated question stems), so it is especially useful if you are looking for public-opinion question wording, survey design, or raw question content about unemployment. It is less relevant if you are searching for analytical content, up-to-date statistics, empirical results, or policy evaluations, since the paragraph contains no numeric outcomes, dates, or interpretive discussion and is highly repetitive. Edge cases: the text is ideal for tasks like translation, coding question-response mappings, or building a corpus of unemployment-related survey items, but not for answering factual questions such as current unemployment rates or evidence-based policy effectiveness. Also note the document is in German with many abbreviations and duplicated lines, which may require deduplication or language-specific processing depending on your use case.
3147	antisemitismus	A user searching "antisemitismus" wants a concise explanation of antisemitism — what it is, how it shows up in society, and recent debates or incidents in Germany (e.g., the "Antisemitismusstreit"). They may also want to know how antisemitism is perceived as a public problem, as reflected in opinion‑survey coding and responses.	A document is relevant to the query "antisemitismus" if it explicitly addresses antisemitism — for example reporting antisemitic incidents, analyzing the “Antisemitismusstreit,” discussing public attitudes or policies toward antisemitism, or if it is a survey result where respondents list antisemitism (code 15) as an important problem. Documents that only mention unrelated items from the long topic list (e.g., unemployment, Euro, Iraq) or that simply include the word “Antisemitismus” as a bare list entry without substantive content should be considered low relevance. Edge cases include pieces about the Israel–Palestine conflict or right‑wing extremism (NPD): these can be highly relevant if they examine antisemitic rhetoric or actions, but not if they treat geopolitics or general extremism without linking to antisemitism. Also watch for synonyms, spelling variants (anti‑Semitism, antisemitic) and brief passing mentions in aggregated codebooks — such matches may be false positives unless the context actually discusses antisemitism.
3148	health	A survey-style information need asking whether respondents received health education and from which sources (family, youth organizations, school, radio/TV/papers, or don't know). It also asks if respondents’ work affects their health and, if so, how — listing specific effects like fatigue, stress, headaches, sleep problems, skin issues, heart disease, anxiety, irritability, stomachache, etc.	A document is relevant when it explicitly contains the survey questions or responses about health education sources (for example “Was this health education within family,” “at school,” “via radio/TV/papers,” or “youth organisation”) or the Q34 items asking whether and how work affects health (e.g., “stress,” “headaches,” “sleep problems,” “heart disease,” “improves health,” or “does not affect”). Relevant examples include a survey row showing v1265 = “Yes, at school” or Q34 = “Headaches” as an answer; these give clear mappings between code labels and meaningful content. Non‑relevant documents are those that only contain unrelated material, purely financial/operational text, or noisy repeated metadata without readable questions or responses (for instance a page of only codes like v1262,v1263 with no human‑readable labels). Edge cases include partial matches (mentions of “health education” but about curriculum policy rather than individual receipt), documents with only DK/“don’t know” entries or untranslated labels (ambiguous but potentially useful for mapping), and verbose duplicates where meaning is present but obscured by repetition.
31794	safety	A request for summary data on public attitudes, experiences and behaviours related to product and workplace safety—specifically whether EU actions have affected consumer safety, exposure to and sources of safety instructions for domestic electrical appliances, preferences for how safety information is delivered, clarity and comprehensibility of written instructions, perceived benefits of health and safety at work, belief in safety symbols, and self-reported compliance with safety guidance. The user wants concise information about how people see, understand, receive and act on safety information and warnings.	A relevant document will directly address consumer and product safety topics covered in the query — for example EU regulatory actions to improve product safety, domestic electrical hazards (risk from liquids, ventilation, rain/moisture, power sources, repairs) and whether people have seen specific safety instructions, logos or symbols. It should also cover how people prefer to receive safety information (leaflets, labels, online), their comprehension of text instructions (too technical, hard to read, plain language, to the point), and self-reported compliance. Non-relevant documents merely using the word “safety” in passing, discussing unrelated domains (e.g., IT/software safety, purely financial risk), or product reviews that omit safety guidance would not match. Edge cases include workplace health-and-safety reports that partially overlap (relevant if they discuss benefits or perceptions), highly technical standards that are about compliance but not user-facing instructions (partially relevant), and multilingual or survey-metadata files that mention these items but do not report respondents’ perceptions (low relevance).
32407	sexual	Aims to collect survey information about people's experiences with sexual advances or harassment at work and perceptions of how common sexual harassment against women is. Also seeks respondents' moral attitudes toward different sexual behaviors — same-sex relations, premarital sex, and extramarital sex — and whether a partner was a spouse or regular sexual partner.	A document is relevant to the keyword "sexual" when it directly discusses sexual behavior, attitudes, or misconduct — for example the paragraph’s survey items about sexual advances at work, sexual relations between consenting adults (same‑sex or opposite‑sex), premarital sex, or extramarital affairs. Items that explicitly mention "sexual harassment," "sexual relations," or "sexual advances" are high‑value hits because they match the query intent and contain substantive questions or descriptions. A document is non‑relevant when the string "sexual" appears only incidentally or in unrelated contexts (e.g., "sexual reproduction" in a biology paper, the substring in "asexual"), or when the mention is perfunctory or part of boilerplate with no topical depth. Edge cases include ambiguous uses of "sex" (biological sex vs. sexual activity), negated statements ("not sexual"), quoted hypotheticals, and repeated/duplicated survey prompts — these can be relevant but may require semantic analysis to determine whether they truly match the user's informational need.
3247	political orientation	A concise definition and overview of "political orientation" — what it means (e.g., left–right, liberal–conservative, party identification) and how it’s commonly measured. Also information on how orientation affects behavior and attitudes (e.g., voting, inter-party cooperation, family influence) and typical survey items used to assess it.	This document is partially relevant to the query "political orientation" because it contains direct survey items and labels that measure or ask about political alignment (for example, "I orient myself towards my child concerning politics" and the choice between MEP cooperation regardless of party vs. cooperation with similar political orientations, plus labels like Q145 EUROP PARLIAMENT MEMBER AFFILIATION). Relevant content includes questions about party affiliation, statements that ask respondents to place themselves politically, and items that explicitly mention political opinion or political orientations. Non-relevant text includes the long repeated blocks about humanitarian aid, discrimination screening, fashion and cultural matters, and metadata/repetition — these do not address ideological orientation unless the user specifically wants adjacent constructs (e.g., "political opinion" mentioned in the humanitarian-aid definition). Edge cases to watch: phrasing like "orient myself" can mean "influence" rather than "hold a political orientation," and many short codes and repeated strings are survey metadata rather than substantive measurement, so relevance should be judged by whether the passage elicits or records ideological self-placement or party/affiliation information.
32738	sicherheit	The user wants to know how people perceive safety in different areas—public places, law and order in Germany, internet security, job security and social security—and whether they feel personally protected. They also seek to identify which aspects of security respondents find lacking today.	A document is relevant to the keyword "Sicherheit" when it explicitly discusses security-related topics—such as "Sicherheit im Internet" (internet security), "Sicherheit des Arbeitsplatzes" (workplace security), "soziale Sicherheit" (social security), or safety in public places—as in the supplied paragraph which lists survey questions about those areas. It is non-relevant when the term appears only incidentally (for example in a compound noun unrelated to the user's intent, a brand name, or as repeated survey codes like V274 without substantive content) or when the word occurs in a different language context that changes meaning. Edge cases include terse transcripts or questionnaires that name the topic but give no explanatory content (these are partially relevant because they indicate subject matter but lack depth), and technical documents about safety equipment or legal regulations which may be relevant only if the user seeks that specific angle. Finally, relevance depends on user intent: a broad query for "Sicherheit" makes any of the above topics useful, whereas a query for a specific subtype (e.g., cyber security vs. social security) requires matching that particular term or related synonyms to be truly relevant.
3294	haushaltseinkommen	The query seeks survey information about household net income: which income bracket the household falls into, the respondent’s and the household’s net income for the last month, and how many people (including pensioners, scholarship recipients, etc.) contribute to that income. It also asks for a subjective assessment of how easy or difficult it currently is for the household to make ends meet.	A document is relevant if it explicitly deals with "Haushaltseinkommen" — for example survey questions, codebook entries or variable definitions that ask for monthly net household income after taxes and social security, income-class categories (e.g. s09, s09hhek, ekdm), or instructions to include all income sources (wages, pensions, stipends). Text that reproduces the questionnaire wording (How high was your personal/net household income last month? How many people contribute?) or lists the specific income bands (including historical DM categories) is highly relevant because it matches the query intent exactly. It is non‑relevant if the document only mentions individual gross income, corporate revenues, household chores, or uses "Haushalt" in a non‑income sense, or if it merely cites the term without any definitions or question text. Edge cases include translations or abridged summaries (potentially relevant if they preserve the monthly net/inclusion rules), materials using a different reference period or currency (annual vs monthly, EUR vs DM) which may require normalization, and machine‑read transcripts or repeated boilerplate that contain the keywords but lack usable metadata or context.
3297	schulische bildung	The user is looking for information about school education in Germany, specifically public attitudes on whether enough is being done for schools and how recent changes in school or vocational training (over the last 12 months) affect career prospects. They also want to capture related survey concerns such as interrupted career plans, inability to finish apprenticeships, fewer suitable training places, underemployment or involuntary part‑time work, and planning of professional careers.	A document is relevant to the query "schulische bildung" if it focuses on school education in Germany—discussing school quality, policy debates (for example, "Wird in Deutschland genug für Schulen getan?"), or first-hand and survey-based accounts of pupils’ and apprentices’ experiences. Relevant examples include analyses of vocational training outcomes (completion rates, fewer apprenticeship places, later underemployment), survey questions about changes to one’s school or vocational education in the last 12 months, and policy proposals affecting schools. Non-relevant documents are those about unrelated topics (e.g., the founding of the Federal Republic), texts that only contain repeated codes or filler without substantive education content, or pieces that treat "Bildung" only as a vague term for lifelong learning or higher education without addressing schools. Edge cases include materials that mention schools only in passing, survey instruments that list questions without results (useful for methodology but limited for content), or documents in another language—these can be partially relevant depending on whether they provide concrete information about school education in Germany.
32984	security	The query seeks survey information on "security," specifically asking what makes people feel financially secure and whether they consider their own financial position secure. It also asks about respondents' awareness of EU external border initiatives (e.g., Frontex, ETIAS, EES, SIS, VIS, Internal Security Fund) and how important they view internal security challenges like terrorism and border protection.	A document is relevant to the keyword "security" when it explicitly addresses security topics, such as personal financial security (questions about what makes you feel financially secure or whether your financial position is secure) or public/internal security (importance of terrorism or EU border security and awareness of initiatives like FRONTEX, ETIAS, EES, SIS, VIS). For example, the listed variables Q21 and Q22A about financial position and savings, and qa19/qa3/qb2 about awareness of border initiatives and the importance of terrorism/EU borders, are clear signals of relevance. A document is non-relevant when it only contains unrelated administrative codes, repeated labels with no substantive content, or discusses an unrelated sense of security (e.g., software/IT security) that does not match the user's intended topics. Edge cases include brief code-lists or variable names that imply security questions—these can be considered marginally relevant if no question text is present, and ambiguous uses of "secure" (secure employment vs cybersecurity) should be judged by surrounding context. Prioritize texts that explicitly mention financial security, terrorism, border control, or named EU initiatives as highly relevant; treat vague or context-free mentions as low relevance.
3307	political participation	The user is looking for how "political participation" is measured in survey data — the specific questionnaire items and variables that capture different forms of engagement (e.g., party membership and activity, frequency of participation in political groups, online discussion/sharing, self-rated involvement, and encouragement to vote). They also want details on topic-specific items (EU enlargement/defence debates), longitudinal participation indicators, and variable coding/derivations.	A document is relevant to the keyword "political participation" when it directly addresses citizens' political actions or engagement — e.g., survey questions or variables about attending party activities, belonging to a political party, voting intentions, following or taking part in online election discussions, or using new technologies to express political opinions. Good examples are items like "In the past 12 months how often have you participated in activities of political parties…" or Q12 entries about online voting and expressing opinion, and membership/status items that distinguish belonging and active participation. A document is less relevant if it only discusses states' or institutions' participation (for example Ireland joining a collective EU defence), reports policy attitudes without any behavioral participation measures, or contains only administrative variable codes with no question text. Edge cases include texts that use the word "participation" in non-political contexts (child or household participation in longitudinal waves) or repeated metadata where the question intent is unclear; these should be checked for accompanying question wording before being treated as relevant. In practice, prioritize documents with explicit participation behaviors, frequency measures, or membership/online-engagement items; deprioritize ones with only topic opinions, institutional participation, or bare variable identifiers.
3340	sex	The user is looking for the survey variable that records respondents' sex/gender — i.e., "Sex" or "Sex of respondent" — across multiple ISSP waves and dataset variable IDs. They want to identify where this variable appears (for example ZA1840, ZA3090, ZA4350, ZA5800, ZA6770, ZA7600, etc.) to locate or harmonize it for analysis.	A document is relevant to the keyword "sex" when it clearly refers to a survey variable or field about respondents' sex/gender—for example lines that say "Sex of respondent," include variable names like "SEX V119" or codes such as "ZA5800" and survey identifiers like "ISSP 2011," which indicate a dataset variable rather than unrelated text. Concrete indicators of high relevance are question wording, variable IDs (v119, v296), dataset codes (ZA3090), and notes about how the variable is coded (male/female, missing codes). A document is non-relevant when "sex" appears only as noisy repetition, as part of other words or acronyms that are unrelated to respondent sex, or when the text discusses sexual activity or biology rather than a dataset variable. Edge cases include ambiguous uses where "Sex" could mean biological category versus sexual behavior, or when formatting/typos merge tokens (e.g., "SEXISSP")—in those cases you should check nearby context (survey name, variable code, question text) to decide relevance. Finally, brief lists of repeated tokens are lower quality matches even if they technically contain "SEX"; the most useful documents include descriptive metadata, coding schemes, or full question text.
33461	rechts links	The query seeks survey measures of political orientation asking respondents to place themselves on left–right scales (e.g., 0–10 or 1–11) or indicate if they are left or right. It also asks for comparative ratings of East vs. West Germans using bipolar adjective scales, marking how strongly opposing traits apply.	A document is relevant to the keyword "rechts links" if it explicitly discusses the political left–right spectrum, especially in the form of survey items or self-placement scales using German terms like "links", "rechts", "Selbsteinstufung", "Einstufung", "Kontinuum" or "Skala". For example, questionnaires asking "Wo würden Sie sich auf einer Skala von 0 bis 10 einordnen?" or "Wenn Sie diese Skala von 1 bis 11 benutzen, wo würden Sie sich selbst einordnen?" are highly relevant because they frame left/right as ideological self-placement. Non-relevant documents include literal directional instructions ("turn left/right"), clinical descriptions of left/right body sides, files or code that only contain the tokens "links" or "rechts", or texts where "Rechts" refers to law or party names without ideological scale context. Edge cases to watch for are bilingual or ambiguous uses (e.g., "links" as hyperlinks or "Die Linke" as a party name), repeated boilerplate survey items (which indicate a questionnaire but may be low-quality or duplicated), and passages that mention the words without any political or survey context — these reduce usefulness even though they contain the keywords.
3365	drogen	A person searching "drogen" here is likely looking for the survey instrument content about drugs — specifically questions on frequency of drug use in the past 12 months (e.g., hashish, marijuana, cocaine, heroin), attitudes toward decriminalizing possession of small amounts (including hard drugs), and the survey coding/listing where "Drogen" appears as a societal/political problem. They want the exact question wording, response options/codes, and how the topic is categorized among other public issues.	A document is relevant to the keyword "drogen" if it directly discusses drugs—especially survey questions or metadata about drug use (for example the repeated question "Wie häufig haben Sie in den letzten 12 Monaten Drogen z.B. Haschisch, Marihuana, Kokain, Heroin … konsumiert"), attitudes toward decriminalization (e.g. F.85a asking whether possession of small amounts should be punished), or coding entries like "58. Drogen" and related variable names (v33001, V207, F.2). Concrete evidence of relevance includes lists of specific substances, frequency-response options, question IDs or codebook entries that map responses to "Drogen", and policy/attitude items about hard drugs. A document is non-relevant if it merely contains the substring "drogen" in passing among many unrelated topics, discusses pharmaceutical drugs in a clinical dosing context without reference to substance use or policy, or only has noisy/duplicated text that obscures any substantive drug-related content. Edge cases to watch for are synonyms and language variants (English "drugs", "narcotics", or German OCR errors that split or misspell "Drogen"), survey fragments that only list "Drogen" as one item among many (lower relevance unless accompanied by questions or codes), and documents that mention drug-related codes (v33001, F.85a) — these are often highly relevant even if the human-readable question is truncated. A practical heuristic: prioritize documents containing explicit drug-use questions, listed substances, or decriminalization/attitude items and treat brief or ambiguous mentions as lower relevance unless corroborated by codes or full question text.
34145	rechtsextremismus	The user is looking for information about right‑wing extremism in Germany — specifically public attitudes, media coverage, perceived threat to democracy, whether enough political and legal action is taken (laws against right‑wing extremism), and survey data (e.g., ZA5573 2008) about these perceptions, including concerns about right‑wing views in the police.	A document is relevant to the keyword "rechtsextremismus" when it explicitly addresses Rechtsextremismus or close variants (e.g., rechtsextreme, Rechtsextreme), discusses legal measures, media coverage, surveys or public opinion (for example the ZA5573 2008 survey items or legislative tags like V199/V186), or treats police involvement and threats to democracy in the context of right‑wing extremism. It is non‑relevant when the word is absent or only generic terms like "extremism" are used without a right‑wing qualifier, when "right" appears in a non‑political sense, or when a file contains only administrative codes, repeated headers or metadata with no substantive content. Edge cases include documents in German with morphological variants or compound words (e.g., rechtsextremes Gedankengut) and translations — these should be matched by stem or synonym lookup because they are often highly relevant. Repeated survey text or media mentions can create noise: repeated headers or duplicated lines are less useful by themselves but still relevant if they contain actual survey questions or analysis. Finally, broad anti‑extremism policy pieces are borderline: they are relevant if they specifically address measures against right‑wing groups, but less so if they only discuss extremism in general without reference to the right‑wing dimension.
3420	left right	Identify survey variables that measure left–right ideological placement—both respondent self-placement and placements of parties and leaders—on 0–10 (or 1–10) scales, including harmonised and recoded/derived versions for comparing respondent and party/leader positions.	A document is relevant to the query "left right" when it discusses the political left–right spectrum or its measurement — for example survey questions or codebook entries that ask respondents to place themselves, parties, or leaders on a 0–10 or 1–10 left–right scale (e.g. V76 Left Right Selfplacement, v241/v242 harmonised or recoded variables, PARTY LR, or items asking about PARTY A or LEADER A). It is non-relevant when "left" and "right" are used as literal directions, handedness, UI layout or other non-political contexts, or when the terms appear only as unrelated field names with no scale or ideological context. Edge cases include snippets that contain variable names like "LEFT RIGHT PLACEMENT HARMONISED" but no question text — these are likely relevant if they are part of a survey codebook or recode documentation, but ambiguous if isolated. Repetition of recode/harmonised labels, explicit scale wording ("where would you place yourself on a scale from 0 to 10") and references to parties or leaders are strong signals of relevance; absence of those cues reduces relevance.
3474	arbeitszeit	The user is looking for information about working hours (Arbeitszeit): who sets schedules and whether employees can choose start/end times, use flexible hours or time accounts, overtime rules, reducing hours before retirement, and how these issues feature in collective bargaining (e.g., metal/electrical industry and public-sector disputes).	A document is relevant to the keyword "arbeitszeit" when it substantively discusses working time issues — for example reduction or increase of hours, overtime, flexible/gleitende Arbeitszeit, Arbeitszeitkonten, who sets start and end times, or collective-bargaining disputes about hours. Strongly relevant passages are full sentences like survey questions about reducing hours before retirement, whether the employer fixes schedules, records of hours worked beyond contract, or debates in the metal/electrical industry over shorter or longer workweeks. A document is less relevant if "arbeitszeit" appears only as an administrative code, repeated token, or header (e.g., V241 ARBEITSZEIT LOHNAUSGLEICH) with no explanatory text, or if it occurs incidentally in a list of topics without substantive content. Edge cases include OCR/encoding artifacts (e.g., "uuml ber" for "über"), concatenated or abbreviated forms ("ARBEITSZEITVERK."), or mentions in a non-labor context (machine uptime vs. employee hours) — these should be considered relevant only if surrounding context clearly matches the labor-related sense.
36787	sustainability	Aims to measure public opinion in the EU about which policy measures should be prioritized for sustainable growth (e.g., environment‑friendly production, support for agriculture, innovation and ICT investment, consumer rights, public service reform, migration control, enterprise creation). It also seeks to assess awareness of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and views on how the EU should ensure its imports are sustainable (mandatory requirements, trade policy leverage, or responsibility of exporting countries).	A document is relevant to the keyword "sustainability" when it explicitly discusses sustainable concepts, policies, or indicators — for example references to sustainable growth, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), environmentally friendly production, or measures to ensure EU imports come from sustainable sources. Items that name specific policy options (supporting sustainable agriculture, obliging exporters to meet sustainability requirements, applying global trade policies, reinforcing consumer rights or investing in green ICT) are clearly relevant because they address practical routes to sustainability. A document is non‑relevant if it only contains unrelated material or purely technical metadata — for instance long runs of repeated question codes or prompts with no substantive content about sustainability. Borderline cases include survey transcripts or lists of response labels that mention "sustainable" only as a tag: these are useful for detecting topic presence but provide limited insight for policy or conceptual analysis. Finally, passages that use "sustainable growth" in a narrow economic sense (e.g., only promoting high‑speed internet or enterprise creation) are partially relevant but may miss environmental or social dimensions of sustainability.
37090	stress arbeit	The user is looking for survey items and variables measuring work-related stress and related job characteristics — e.g., frequency of feeling stressed, changes in stress over time, time pressure, overall job satisfaction, willingness to keep working, responsibility for other employees, workplace location/sector/type, and other employment conditions. They likely want these items to analyze workplace stress and its correlates.	A document is relevant to the keyword "stress arbeit" if it explicitly addresses stress at work — for example survey items asking whether respondents feel "oft/manchmal/selten/nie im Stress," whether stress has increased or decreased over the years, or how often people work under time pressure. Clear matches include German question text like "Wenn Sie einmal an Ihre tägliche Arbeit denken: fühlen Sie sich dabei oft, manchmal, selten oder nie im Stress?" or items measuring frequency of working under time pressure. Documents are non-relevant when they focus on unrelated topics that happen to appear in the same corpus (e.g., party politics, country of work, public vs. private sector comparisons, or reasons for part‑time work) unless those sections explicitly tie back to workplace stress. Edge cases: a text that mentions "stress" in a different sense (mechanical/physiological stress) or uses only metadata variable names (V99, Q16) without the actual stress question is not relevant; conversely, documents that do not use the word "stress" but measure time pressure or job strain can be partially relevant as proxies. Duplicate survey blocks or repeated wording count as relevant if they include the stress items, but mere lists of variable names without content should be considered non‑relevant.
38053	social status	Looking for definitions and survey measures that capture an individual's social status in demographic data. This includes variables for occupation and current employment, marital status, household role (head or spouse/partner), and broader socioeconomic position.	Relevant documents are those that explicitly define, list, or measure indicators of social status — for example occupation/occupation status, current employment status, socio‑economic status, marital status, head‑of‑household or main source of living — such as survey questionnaires, dataset codebooks, or research that uses variables like V133, V125, Q110a, etc. A paragraph like the one above, which enumerates variable names and labels for occupation, marital and household roles, is a good match because it clearly maps the constructs used to capture social status. Non‑relevant documents would be those that use the word “status” in a different sense (system status, health status, order status) or only contain isolated repetitions of the token “status” without contextual definitions or measures. Edge cases include files that mention one indicator (only marital status or only employment) — these can be relevant if the user accepts single‑indicator measures — and ambiguous variable labels (e.g., MAINSTAT, SPMAINST) that require metadata checking to confirm they refer to social status.
38113	social mobility	A clear explanation of what social mobility is — how and why individuals or families move up or down socioeconomic strata — including its types (intergenerational vs. intragenerational), common measures (income, education, occupation), and the main factors that affect it. The user may also want evidence on trends and cross-country comparisons, and policy options to increase mobility.	A document is relevant to the query "social mobility" when it directly discusses changes in people’s socioeconomic position over time or across generations — for example analyses of income mobility, intergenerational earnings elasticity, occupational or educational transitions, mobility matrices, longitudinal studies, or evaluations of policies (like education or tax reforms) intended to increase upward mobility. Relevant documents typically present measures, empirical evidence, country or cohort comparisons, theoretical mechanisms (e.g., role of schooling, labor markets, discrimination), or concrete case studies. Documents are non-relevant if they focus on unrelated meanings of “mobility” (physical movement, transport, or device/mobile technology), on online data disclosure or social-media features, or if they only mention “social mobility” in passing without substantive treatment. Edge cases include reports that use “Social Mobility” as an organizational/program name (which can be relevant if the report evaluates mobility outcomes) and papers that mention mobility briefly in broader studies — those require checking the abstract or methods to decide relevance.
38133	sozial	The query seeks survey-related information about "social": specifically respondents' social class coding and evaluations of the German social market economy (e.g., whether people are satisfied with it), plus which parties or politicians are seen as more socially oriented or best able to solve local social problems (mentioning Bremen).	A document is relevant to the keyword "sozial" when it substantively discusses social topics such as the social market economy (soziale Marktwirtschaft), social class (soziale Schicht), social policy, or survey questions and responses about who is "socially" oriented or which party can solve social problems in Germany. For example, a policy brief analyzing public opinion on "Was meinen Sie zur sozialen Marktwirtschaft in Deutschland?" or a survey dataset that contains question texts and coded responses about soziale Schicht would be clearly relevant. Documents that are non-relevant include those that only contain the token "sozial" as a metadata label, codebook entry (e.g., v253, v132), repeated boilerplate, or brand/organizational names where no social-policy content is present. Edge cases include files that contain the survey variable labels and question stems but no respondent data (partially useful), translations or English-language texts that use "social" without addressing the German concepts (borderline), and heavily duplicated or corrupted text blocks that mention "sozial" but provide no substantive information.
3856	generationen	The user is looking for information on public attitudes toward different generations, specifically survey items and responses about whether coalition negotiations harm younger people, the upward prospects of 20–35-year-olds, support for climate activists’ demands, and whether future generations should be reminded of or held responsible for crimes of the Third Reich. They need a concise summary of these survey topics and the underlying questions about intergenerational justice, memory, and climate policy.	A document is relevant to the keyword "generationen" if it explicitly discusses age cohorts, intergenerational issues, or references to future or younger generations — for example questions about “the generation of today’s 20–35 year‑olds,” “künftige Generationen,” or survey items on whether future generations should be reminded of the Holocaust. Texts that connect generations to policy or social debates (e.g., coalition negotiations that harm younger people, climate activism by the “Letzte Generation,” or debates about responsibility for Third Reich crimes) are clearly relevant because they address attitudes, impacts, or obligations across generations. Non‑relevant documents mention the string “generationen” only incidentally (product generations, technical “generation” of data, or isolated metadata and question codes like F.135/F.138 without substantive wording) or use the term in an unrelated sense. Edge cases include German variants, OCR/errors and repeated paragraphs: an otherwise short snippet that only lists “Künftige Generationen” might be borderline relevant if fuller context is unavailable, while policy text that uses “generation” metaphorically should be treated cautiously. In indexing, prioritize documents that pair the term with concrete age groups, policies, surveys, or movements (e.g., climate activists) and deprioritize those where the term is a terse label, part code, or unrelated technical term.
3938	gender	The user is looking for a clear definition and overview of "gender" — including distinctions between biological sex and gender, concepts like gender identity and roles, and possibly how to record or code gender in data/surveys (hints: variable labels such as d10, v601).	A document is relevant to the keyword "gender" if it contains substantive information about gender—such as definitions, discussions of gender identity and roles, demographic statistics, policy or legal analysis on gender equality, or empirical studies of gendered outcomes—rather than just the word appearing incidentally. Documents that are non-relevant typically only contain boilerplate labels or repeated tokens like "d10 GENDER" or variable codes (v601, v615) with no explanatory text, dumps of form field names, or noisy repetition that provides no conceptual or analytical content. Edge cases include survey instruments or data dictionaries where a lone "GENDER" field is meaningful for research on how gender was measured (these are relevant for methodology queries but less so for conceptual queries), and documents that conflate "sex" and "gender"—they may be relevant if they clarify the distinction, or misleading if they use the terms interchangeably without explanation. Also watch for homonyms: texts about grammatical gender in language are about a different concept and may be irrelevant unless the user intended that sense. Examples: a study on workplace gender pay gaps is highly relevant, while a CSV export with thousands of repeated "Gender" labels and no context is not.
39449	sozialleistungen	The user is looking for information about public attitudes and survey questions on social benefits — specifically whether welfare should be cut, kept the same, or expanded. They also want to know about concerns over misuse of benefits (e.g., unemployment support/Hartz IV) and whether an SPD election win would lead to further cuts.	A document is relevant to the keyword "sozialleistungen" when it directly addresses public social benefits — for example proposals to cut or expand welfare, news about Arbeitslosengeld or Hartz IV, survey questions asking whether benefits should be reduced or increased, or discussions of alleged missbrauch (abuse) of benefits. Concrete policy texts, legislative proposals, opinion polls, and journalistic analyses about how elections (e.g., an SPD victory) would affect benefit levels are clear matches. Documents are non-relevant when the term appears in an unrelated sense (company employee benefits, private insurance), in isolated metadata or repeating codes with no topical content, or as OCR/spam duplicates that add no new information. Edge cases include statistical reports that mention Sozialleistungen only as a demographic variable (partly relevant), texts that use synonyms or English translations (welfare, social assistance) which should be treated as relevant if they refer to public transfers, and documents with topic codes like "V99" — these codes can be relevant if they are indexing topical content but are low value by themselves.
40249	soziale herkunft	A clear definition of "soziale Herkunft" (social origin) and how it is measured and used in surveys — e.g., which indicators (parents' education/occupation, household status, migration background) define someone’s social background and how that classification is applied to analyze attitudes or behaviors.	A document is relevant to the query "soziale herkunft" when it explicitly discusses a person's social origin or social class — for example questions or passages about parental education, occupation, income, upbringing, self‑identified social stratum, or survey items labeled "soziale Herkunft" or "soziale Schicht." Passages that treat "Herkunft" as ethnic or national origin (e.g., "ausländischer Herkunft" or asking how aware someone was of different origin) can be partially relevant if the search accepts cultural/ethnic background, but they differ from strictly socio‑economic measures. Documents that are not relevant use "Herkunft" to mean provenance of objects or data (e.g., funds of unknown origin, CDs of dubious origin) or discuss the "soziale Marktwirtschaft" as an economic policy rather than individual background. Edge cases include transcripts with repeated metadata or ambiguous mentions of "Herkunft" — these should only be included if surrounding text clearly links the term to social class, mobility, or upbringing.
4034	soziale ungleichheit	The user is looking for a clear overview of "soziale Ungleichheit" — what social inequality is, how it is measured (income, education, occupation/social class), its main causes and social consequences. They also want to understand how social class relates to public attitudes (e.g., toward the social market economy) and political choices or party solutions for social problems in Germany.	A document is relevant to the query "soziale ungleichheit" if it explicitly discusses social inequality or its indicators (income, wealth, education, occupational class, poverty, social mobility), describes causes or consequences, or evaluates policies aimed at reducing unequal outcomes. The paragraph includes potentially relevant terms — "Soziale Schicht," "soziale Marktwirtschaft," and "soziale Probleme" and political questions about which party can solve social problems — which are useful when they report measurements, opinions, or analyses of distributional differences. It is non-relevant when the text is only metadata, repeated survey codes and labels (v253, v132, Punktbewertung, Vercoden, IfD) or verbatim question duplicates that contain no substantive results or interpretation. Edge cases: a survey question about support for the "soziale Marktwirtschaft" is relevant if used to study attitudes toward inequality or redistribution, but irrelevant if it appears only as an isolated question label; likewise, the label "Soziale Schicht" is relevant when linked to respondent data but not when it appears only in a coding legend. Prioritize documents with actual measures, analysis, or contextual explanation of inequality and deprioritize those that are mere administrative or repetitive text.
40380	soziale lage	The user wants information about the "social situation" — i.e., the social and economic status of different population groups and social classes. They are also interested in public perceptions (e.g., whether the situation of the socially weak has improved), attitudes toward the social market economy, and which political parties are seen as best able to solve social problems.	A document is relevant to the query "soziale lage" when it contains substantive content about people’s social or economic position, welfare of socially weak groups, or attitudes toward social policy — for example the repeated survey question “Was meinen Sie zur sozialen Marktwirtschaft in Deutschland” and items about “sozial Schwachen” and “Soziale Schicht” are direct matches. Metadata and variable codes (v253, v132, v114, v883, F.36b, F30) that label such questions are also relevant when they point to measures of social status or social problems, because they enable linking responses to social-lage analyses. The document is less relevant if it only contains administrative codes, duplicate lines, date stamps, or pagination without the substantive question text (e.g., long repeated copies of the same label or raw coding lists with no context). Edge cases include mentions of “soziale” in compound terms: “soziale Marktwirtschaft” is relevant but narrower (policy attitude rather than objective economic status), while a lone occurrence of “soziale” in an unrelated context (social media, organizational names) would not be relevant.
40505	soziale kontakte	The user wants to know about a person's social contacts — specifically the quality of contact with neighbors and whether they have personal contacts with Germans. They also want to know if the person has been in contact with state- or non‑profit advice or social‑security institutions in Germany within the past five years.	A document is relevant to the keyword "soziale kontakte" when it discusses interpersonal social ties — for example the quality or frequency of contact with neighbors, personal friendships, or whether someone has personal contacts with Germans — or when it records interactions with social support services that reflect a person’s social network. Direct examples of relevant content are survey questions like "Wie ist der Kontakt zu den Nachbarn?" or "Haben Sie persönlich Kontakte zu Deutschen?" and items asking whether a respondent has been in contact with counseling or social-security organizations in the last five years. A document is non‑relevant if it uses the words "Kontakt" or "soziale" in a different sense (e.g., physical contact, contact lenses, or abstract social policy) or if it only contains boilerplate/duplicated administrative text without substantive information on social ties. Edge cases include papers about public‑health measures that reduce social contacts (which are relevant if the user’s intent is social interaction) and texts that describe institutional contact (e.g., with agencies) — these may be relevant only if the queryer cares about social support networks rather than purely personal relationships.
40541	soziale kompetenzen	The user is looking for a clear definition and examples of "soziale Kompetenzen" (social/interpersonal skills) — e.g., communication, teamwork, empathy, conflict resolution — and guidance on how to identify, assess, or describe these abilities when comparing job requirements or answering surveys and application questions.	A document is relevant to the keyword "soziale kompetenzen" when it explicitly discusses personal social skills or closely related synonyms — for example mentions of "soziale Fähigkeiten", "Teamfähigkeit", "Kommunikationsfähigkeit", "Empathie" or passages defining "Kompetenzen" in a social or interpersonal context. In the supplied paragraph, the sentence "Diese Frage bezieht sich auf Ihre Fähigkeiten. Unter Fähigkeiten verstehen wir alle Kenntnisse Fertigkeiten Kompetenzen ..." could be relevant if the surrounding questions ask about interpersonal work skills, whereas repeated references to "Und wer ist sozialer eingestellt ..." also point toward social orientation and may be relevant. Conversely, many lines referring to "soziale Marktwirtschaft", "Soziale Schicht", "soziale Probleme" or the "Kompetenz" of the Bundeskanzler are non‑relevant because they treat "sozial" as a political or economic adjective rather than individual social competencies. Edge cases include generic mentions of "Fähigkeiten" (ambiguous — potentially relevant if later narrowed to social skills) and survey items about being "sozial eingestellt" which are borderline and require checking whether they measure interpersonal competence or political/social attitudes.
40674	soziale arbeit	The user wants a summary of survey items and public attitudes regarding the Wahlalternative Arbeit und soziale Gerechtigkeit (WASG) and the PDS — specifically questions about their planned alliance/merger into Die Linke, which side would have more influence, and whether the joint party would do well in elections. They also seek related opinions on social class and attitudes toward Germany’s social market economy.	A document is relevant to the keyword "soziale arbeit" when it directly treats social work as a profession or field—covering topics like Sozialarbeit/Soziale Arbeit curricula, job roles (Sozialarbeiter/in), case management, client interventions, community or youth work (Jugendarbeit), Sozialgesetzbuch practice, service descriptions, or research and evaluations of social work programs. Relevant signals include exact phrases ("Soziale Arbeit", "Sozialarbeiter"), practical examples, training requirements, service delivery details, or discussion of professional ethics and methods. A document is non-relevant if it only uses the adjective "soziale" in political slogans or party names (e.g., "soziale Gerechtigkeit", "soziale Marktwirtschaft", WASG/PDS/Die Linke) or discusses social class ("soziale Schicht") or electoral alliances without any connection to the practice or profession of social work. Edge cases include policy or election texts: these are partially relevant only when they explicitly describe impacts on social work practice, funding, or regulation; otherwise they should be treated as irrelevant. Finally, watch for ambiguity where "Arbeit" means employment rather than the discipline—context and collocations (capitalization, adjacent terms like "Studium" or "Sozialarbeiter") decide relevance.
41495	soziale medien	The user is looking for survey-style information about social media as an information source — specifically how often people use social platforms, blogs and forums to follow current events and politics. They also want related public-opinion items about media coverage, media influence on political attitudes, trust in reporting, and topical media debates (e.g., scandals, right‑wing extremism, gender‑inclusive language).	This document is highly relevant to the query "soziale medien" because it explicitly and repeatedly asks about using "Soziale Medien, Blogs und Foren" (e.g. Facebook or Twitter) as information sources and how many days per week respondents use them for current events and political topics. It appears to be a survey instrument (ZA5573, repeated items) so it is especially useful for research on social-media use frequency, civic/political information behavior, and media effects. Parts of the paragraph that focus on traditional media coverage of specific politicians (Friedman, Wulff, Steinbrück), gendered language, right‑wing extremism, or the social market economy are less relevant if you are only interested in platform features, user interaction, or technical/social network analysis. Edge cases: the document is still partly relevant when social media is one variable among many in a broader media-attitudes questionnaire, but it is not helpful if you need platform‑technical details, moderation policies, or English-language materials.
41546	soziale netzwerke	The query seeks details about survey items (ISSP 2017) asking which political parties contacted respondents via social networks (e.g., Facebook) — listing parties like CDU/CSU, SPD, AfD, NPD, FDP, Greens, Pirates and “other” — along with related questionnaire instructions (how to answer, navigation) and variables for social class scoring.	A document is relevant when it explicitly addresses "soziale Netzwerke" as online platforms or as survey items asking whether respondents were contacted by parties via sites like Facebook — for example, questionnaire text listing parties (CDU/CSU, SPD, AfD, Grüne, FDP, PIRATEN, NPD) or variable codes such as v121a/v121d that map to those items. Text that contains the ISSP label, respondent instructions for the social networks module, or the exact question wording ("Von welchen Parteien wurden Sie über ein soziales Netzwerk ... kontaktiert") is a strong signal of relevance. A document is non-relevant if it only uses the words "soziale" or "Netzwerke" in unrelated senses (e.g., "soziale Marktwirtschaft," social safety nets, or professional networks) and never refers to online/social-support networks or political contact. Edge cases include materials about offline social support networks (which may be relevant if the search intent is broad), metadata or code lists with no question text (marginally relevant), and noisy OCR duplicates or repeated boilerplate (relevant but lower quality); clarifying user intent (online platforms vs. social support) helps decide borderline cases.
4160	stress	The user is looking for the exact survey question wordings, variable codes, and response options used to measure job-related stress (e.g., "My job is rarely stressful" and "How often do you find your work stressful") and frequency of using the internet for anxiety/stress information across ISSP waves. They want to identify and compare these items (and their dataset IDs) across different years.	A document is relevant if it contains survey items or questionnaire text that directly measure stress — for example single‑item measures like "My job is rarely stressful," frequency items such as "How often do you find your work stressful," or questions about looking online in the past 12 months for "information related to anxiety, stress or similar problems," and/or if it cites ISSP question codes (e.g., ZA1840 Q17c, ZA3090 Q15c). Exact phrasings, screening instructions (e.g., "IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY WORKING FOR PAY"), and time frames (past 12 months) are particularly useful because they match the query’s content and response-context. Non‑relevant documents include those that only mention the word “stress” in other domains (mechanical stress, engineering stress tests), that discuss unrelated constructs (e.g., general job satisfaction) without measuring stress, or that contain only metadata or duplicate lines without the item text. Edge cases: synonyms and closely related terms like "anxiety" or "tension," translated versions of the same items, and surveys with different response scales are typically relevant, while documents that only tangentially reference mental health without explicit stress items are borderline. Documents repeating the same item many times add little extra value, but should still be flagged as relevant if they reproduce the target questions verbatim.
41655	soziale mobilität	The searcher wants a clear overview of "soziale Mobilität" — what it means (ability of individuals or groups to change social class or status), how it is measured (intergenerational vs. intragenerational mobility, indicators like education, occupation and income), and what causes, trends, and policies affect it (especially in contexts like Germany). They may also be looking for survey questions, coding schemes, and data used to assess social mobility and its relation to social class and economic outcomes.	A document is relevant to the keyword "soziale Mobilität" if it explicitly addresses movement between social strata — for example studies or survey items about intergenerational mobility, barriers and enablers of upward/downward mobility, measures (education, income, occupation) tracking class changes, or policies intended to improve social mobility. Relevant examples include analyses tying "soziale Schicht" to life-course outcomes, longitudinal data on children’s outcomes vs parents’, or evaluations of programs that change access to education or employment. Non-relevant documents are those about physical movement or disability mobility (e.g., “Bewegungsfreiheit beschränkt”), texts about the “soziale Marktwirtschaft” (social market economy) or political satisfaction measures without linking to class mobility, and administrative/coding templates or repeated boilerplate. Edge cases: a mention of “soziale Schicht” is relevant only if the text discusses transitions between classes or mobility indicators; isolated survey questions about local social problems or party competence are tangential unless they explicitly connect to mechanisms of social mobility.
4182	stress am arbeitsplatz	The user is looking for information about workplace stress—how often employees feel stressed, whether stress has changed over recent years, and how these factors are measured in surveys (including links with computer/internet use at the workplace).	A document is relevant to the query "stress am arbeitsplatz" when it explicitly addresses stress at work—for example asking how often someone feels stressed during daily work or whether work stress has increased, decreased, or stayed the same. The paragraph contains those exact survey items (e.g., "FÜHLEN SIE SICH … IM STRESS" and "HAT DER STRESS … EHER ZUGENOMMEN/EHER ABGENOMMEN"), so those parts are clearly relevant. Repeated lines about "Halten Sie Ihren Arbeitsplatz ..." or the computer/internet usage questions are only relevant if they are linked to causes or correlates of stress (e.g., stress from computer use or job insecurity); otherwise they are noise. Edge cases include survey metadata and codes (V247, v77) or heavy duplication—useful if you need questionnaire structure but not if you only want substantive discussion of workplace stress. Overall the text is partially relevant: it contains direct stress items but also contains redundant and off-topic material that should be filtered for a focused answer.
427	migration	A search for "migration" here seeks public-opinion survey material on migration, especially attitudes toward irregular/illegal migration policy (assistance, burden-sharing among EU members, or national responsibility). It also targets perceptions of EU enlargement’s migration effects — expected scale of migration and whether impacts are positive or negative (jobs, wages, culture, housing, identity, social costs, etc.).	A document is relevant if it directly addresses irregular/illegal migration in the EU context or the expected migration effects of EU enlargement, especially when it discusses the specific survey items and themes seen here (qb8 and Q24 series) such as assistance to member states, cost‑sharing, members handling migrants themselves, and perceived impacts on jobs, wages, housing, culture and national identity. Look for texts that reproduce or analyze the Eurobarometer-style questions, report public opinion results, or assess policy responses (for example a policy brief on cost‑sharing across EU states or a survey report that tabulates responses to Q24A–D). Non‑relevant documents mention “migration” only in other senses (bird migration, internal rural‑urban moves, or immigration outside the EU/enlargement frame), focus solely on legal immigration/asylum law without addressing irregular migration or enlargement effects, or only contain unrelated code lists with no explanatory metadata. Edge cases include datasets or CSV files that contain qb8/Q24 codes but lack a codebook—these are potentially useful but need the questionnaire to be interpretable—and translations or duplicated questionnaire text, which are relevant if they preserve the meaning of the survey items but less so if they are garbled or truncated.
43444	consumer	Determine whether the respondent is currently a member of a consumer association and, if not, collect their specific reasons for non‑membership (e.g., cost, no need, no time, poor service, distance, canceled membership). Also establish whether they have ever asked a consumer association for help and, if not, the reasons for never seeking assistance (e.g., never needed, not useful, no contact, don’t understand, bad service).	A relevant document will explicitly address membership in consumer associations and the reasons people give for not belonging or for never asking such associations for help — for example a survey instrument, codebook, or report containing items like Q27C/Q33D and response options such as “no time,” “too expensive,” “bad service,” “never needed,” or “didn’t know any.” Documents that simply mention “consumer” in other contexts (consumer electronics, consumer prices, or business-to-consumer markets) or that discuss membership in unrelated organizations (trade associations, unions) are not relevant. Pay attention to phrasing and abbreviations: “CONSUMER ASS” might mean “consumer association” or “consumer assistance,” so texts that clearly use it to list membership/status questions are relevant, while ones referring to assistance programs without membership questions are borderline. Format matters: questionnaires, survey transcripts, frequency tables, and coded response lists are highly relevant examples; news stories or policy analyses are only relevant if they specifically report on reasons for non‑membership or lack of contact. Edge cases include OCR or translation errors that repeat or scramble codes — these can still be relevant if you can map the fragments back to the membership/assistance questions.
43910	covid	A summary of survey items asking respondents how the COVID-19 pandemic changed their confidence in government and the health care system, their employment and household income, how often they meet family and friends in person (before vs. now), and their attitudes about whether people who caught COVID-19 were careless.	A document is relevant if it contains the specific COVID survey items or close variants of them: questions about whether the country’s handling of the pandemic changed confidence in the government or health care system (Q30a/Q30b), comparisons of current work activity and household income to pre‑pandemic levels (Q31/Q32), frequency of in‑person meetings with family or friends before vs now (Q33, including TW/Taiwan variants), and attitude items such as “Most people who tested positive for Covid‑19 contracted the virus because they were careless” (Q34b). Exact question codes (v64–v70, Q30–Q34), labels like OPT/OPTIONAL, and answer formats (increased/decreased/about the same; more/less/about the same) strengthen relevance because they indicate the document is the survey instrument or raw dataset. Partial matches — for example an article about COVID economic impacts or a clinical paper mentioning “confidence in government” without the survey phrasing or pre/post comparisons — are less relevant. Edge cases include documents that use synonyms or different punctuation (Covid-19, COVID19, “pandemic handling”), translated versions, or duplicated question blocks (repeats of items) which should be considered relevant if the core item text and response options are present; purely clinical, virological, or news content that lacks these survey items is non‑relevant.
44361	culture	A concise description of survey information on "culture": the user needs measures of cultural engagement (e.g., how often people use the Internet for cultural purposes), attitudes toward immigrant assimilation versus cultural retention, and which specific cultural or ethnic groups respondents associate with the phrase "people with another culture" (listing many named groups).	A document is relevant to the query "culture" when it contains substantive content about cultural practices, identity, attitudes or behaviours — for example survey question wording about using the Internet for cultural purposes, statements on whether immigrants should retain or adopt a country's culture, or enumerations of specific cultural/ethnic groups (e.g. North African, East European, Buddhist/Hindu). Listings of variable names or codes (v177, v197, qb5) can still be relevant if they accompany clear question text, response options or results, but isolated variable IDs with no context are of low relevance. Edge cases include texts that use the word "culture" in a different domain (e.g. bacterial culture) which would be non-relevant, or documents that only repeat noisy or duplicated lines — those lower the document’s usefulness even if the topic is on-point. In short, preference should be given to passages that explain cultural concepts, survey questions, findings or examples, while excluding uninterpreted metadata, irrelevant domain usages, or purely duplicated content.
4472	stress work	The user is looking for survey items and variables that measure work-related stress—e.g., frequency of finding work stressful and agreement with “my job is rarely stressful”—and related employment characteristics (occupation, company size, hours worked, employment status) and help-seeking (internet use for anxiety/stress). The likely goal is to locate and compare these questionnaire items/variable codes across ISSP waves to analyze prevalence and correlates of job stress.	A document is relevant to the query "stress work" if it explicitly measures or discusses work‑related stress — for example by containing survey items like "How often do you find your work stressful?" (Q13b v31), "My job is rarely stressful" (v47 Q15d), or related variables that contextualize workplace strain such as hours worked, occupation, and company size. Documents that only tangentially touch stress (e.g., a question about general anxiety or internet searches for anxiety information, Q12b) are partially relevant because they may reflect coping or help‑seeking tied to work stress, whereas documents about stress in non‑work domains (family stress, engineering "stress tests", medical stress reactions) are not relevant. Metadata lists of variable codes or duplicated question texts are relevant for mapping or harmonization tasks but may be non‑informative if they lack the actual item wording or response data. Edge cases to watch for include questions about working during summer holidays (relevant if the item links to workload or stress), variations in phrasing ("stress at work" vs "find your work stressful"), timeframe qualifiers (e.g., "past 12 months"), and false positives where the word "stress" appears in unrelated contexts.
45770	climate change attitudes	A summary of public opinion about which actors within the EU are seen as responsible for tackling climate change (e.g., national governments, the European Union, businesses/industry, regional/local authorities, individuals, “all of them,” “none,” or “don’t know”). The query appears to refer to survey variables and responses to the question “In your opinion who within the EU is responsible for tackling climate change.”	A document is relevant when it reports or analyzes public attitudes about who should be responsible for tackling climate change within the EU — for example survey results, tables or commentary showing how respondents allocate responsibility to national governments, the European Union, businesses, regional/local authorities, individuals, “all of them,” or “none/don’t know.” Highly relevant items will include the question wording, response categories (as shown here), response distributions, comparisons across countries or demographic groups, and any interpretation of what those patterns mean. Documents are not relevant if they only discuss climate science, mitigation technologies, legal instruments, or EU policy mechanics without any measurement of public opinion, or if they concern non-EU populations; a bare list of variable codes with no frequencies or explanation is of limited relevance. Edge cases: a raw questionnaire or codebook is partially relevant because it shows question wording and response options, while a methodological paper about survey design is useful for assessing data quality but does not itself describe attitudes unless it reports results.
45793	climate	The query seeks to determine which actors within the EU people consider responsible for tackling climate change. It aims to summarize survey responses assigning responsibility to entities like national governments, the European Union, businesses/industry, regional/local authorities, individuals, others, or combinations/none/don't know.	A document is relevant to the query "climate" when it explicitly discusses climate change—particularly who is responsible for tackling it within the EU—and lists actors or response options such as national governments, the European Union, businesses/industry, local/regional authorities, individuals, "all of them", "none", or "don't know". For example, survey questionnaires, poll results, or analytical articles that include the repeated question "In your opinion who within the EU is responsible for tackling climate change" and associated coding labels (qa3, qb3, qc3, V565, etc.) are highly relevant because they show how responsibility is framed and measured. A document is non-relevant if "climate" appears in a different sense (e.g., organizational or workplace climate), or if the text only contains noisy metadata or isolated codes without any substantive wording or responses. Edge cases include repeated or corrupted question strings: duplicated question text and code lists may still be useful if you need the questionnaire instrument or variable mapping, but are less useful if you need analyzed responses or interpretive commentary. Finally, relevance increases if the document situates the discussion in the EU context; otherwise a general climate-change piece outside the EU is only partially relevant.
4600	gewalt	A concise summary of survey materials on "Gewalt" (violence): the user is looking for questionnaire items, response categories and some frequency data about various forms of violence—youth violence, violence against police, school violence, political violence (e.g., Joschka Fischer), and opinions on blame in the Israel–Palestine conflict—along with coding labels used in the survey. The underlying need is to locate the exact question wordings, response options and summary counts/labels for research or analysis of public attitudes toward violence.	Relevant documents explicitly mention or measure "Gewalt" (violence) in substantive contexts — for example questions or results about Gewalt gegen Polizisten, Gewalt von Jugendlichen, Gewalt unter Schülern, or Gewalt im Nahen Osten, or tables that report survey responses (F.124, F.64A/B) about who is to blame or whether violence is acceptable. Documents that include the questionnaire wording, prevalence statistics, or detailed discussion of causes and consequences are highly relevant because they directly address the query term. Non‑relevant documents merely containing the token "gewalt" as part of a code label, OCR artifact, repeated header, or in a different compound sense (e.g. "Gewaltenteilung" = separation of powers) are not useful. Edge cases include negated mentions ("keine Gewalt"), morphological variants and synonyms (gewalttätig, Gewalttaten, Gewaltbereitschaft) which should be treated as relevant, while mentions in other languages or as incidental list items with no substantive content should be treated with caution.
46134	care arbeit	The query seeks survey items about work and care-related topics—employment status and arrangements, working conditions (time pressure, workplace location, working with others), job satisfaction, reasons for part-time work, responsibility for other employees, and whether one would continue working if financially secure. It also includes related sociodemographic and attitudinal questions such as having a driver’s license, confidence in the health-care system, perceived likelihood of detection for drunk driving, and evaluations of political parties' performance.	A document is relevant to the keyword "care arbeit" if it specifically addresses care work or the care sector — for example nursing, eldercare, childcare, health-care employment, working conditions in care jobs, job satisfaction of care workers, or comparisons between public- and private-sector care employment. Items that simply mention unrelated survey topics (driver’s licenses, drunk-driving detection, party performance, or general political questions) are not relevant. Relevant examples include a survey question about confidence in the health care system, reasons for part-time work in nursing, or whether people would prefer to keep working in a care role if financially independent; non-relevant examples include questions about having a driver’s license or police detection of drunk driving. Edge cases to watch for are mixed survey instruments that bundle care-related questions with many unrelated items (those can be partially relevant), and language ambiguity (German “Arbeit” or English uses of “care” in non-care contexts like “take care”) which can produce false positives.
4690	gesundheit	The querent is looking for phrasing about self-rated general health and perceived health risks (e.g., spoiled meat, BSE, avian flu, coronavirus). Likely this is for survey questions asking respondents to rate their overall health and whether specific outbreaks or hazards threaten their health.	A document is relevant to the keyword "gesundheit" when it centers on health topics—explicit German terms like gesundheit, gesundheitszustand, or health-related questions, descriptions, or data (for example, a survey asking "Wie würden Sie Ihren Gesundheitszustand im Allgemeinen beschreiben?" or paragraphs about BSE, Vogelgrippe, or Coronavirus). Text that contains substantive discussion of conditions, risks, preventive measures, health status codes, or survey instruments is strongly relevant; repeating questionnaire items or explanatory passages about illness clearly qualify. Documents are non-relevant if the word appears only incidentally (e.g., as an interjection "Gesundheit!" after a sneeze), in unrelated brand names, or as isolated codes or metadata with no health context. Edge cases include compound words and inflected forms (gesundheits-, gesundheitszustand), translations or misspellings—these should be matched and reviewed for context—and long boilerplate repetitions (which are relevant but may add little new information). Prefer documents that provide meaningful content (questions, explanations, statistics) rather than mere token occurrences when deciding relevance.
47291	drug	The user is looking for survey-style information about public experiences and perceptions of drugs — e.g., how often people encounter drug-related problems locally, personal contact with addicts, and whether drugs are seen as a workplace or community problem. They also want views on drug addiction’s impacts (social, health, economic, moral, criminal), perceived availability and danger of specific drugs, and awareness of particular substances.	A document is relevant to the keyword "drug" when its primary content discusses drugs or drug-related issues—e.g., descriptions of drug use, addiction, contact with drug problems, availability (how easy to obtain heroin or ecstasy), public health or workplace impacts, and attitudes toward different drug types. Concrete survey items such as "seeing people dealing in drugs," "finding syringes," "possibility to get hold of heroin," or lists of drug names (ecstasy, cannabis, heroin) are strong relevance signals. Documents are non-relevant when the word appears only as an administrative code, in unrelated contexts (e.g., a pharmacy inventory or a clinical prescription regimen without social/behavioral context), or when the mention is tangential (only paired with alcohol where drugs are not discussed further). Edge cases include noisy or duplicated survey text (repeated prompts that add little new information) and mixed-topic records where drug-related questions are present but buried among unrelated metadata—these are partially relevant and useful mainly for structural or methodological analysis rather than topical content.
4811	ukraine	The user wants clarification on how "Ukraine" is represented in the dataset's region and weighting variables (e.g., V231, V252, V253), specifically which country groups include or exclude Ukraine, whether Ukraine's national weight V280 is applied, and how to correctly use those sample weights.	A document is relevant to the query "ukraine" if it explicitly names Ukraine (or "the Ukraine") as a region or country in the dataset, describes weighting variables that include Ukraine’s share of the population (for example V231 Region Ukraine, V253/V252 weight variables that list Ukraine in country group 3 or 4), or gives instructions about using national weights for Ukrainian samples. For example, a paragraph that repeatedly labels "Region Ukraine" or explains that a weight adjusts national samples in proportion to Ukraine’s population is directly on-topic. A document is non‑relevant if it never mentions Ukraine, only discusses other countries, or explicitly sets Ukraine’s weight to zero for a particular variable (in which case it is not useful for analyses seeking Ukrainian-specific weights). Edge cases include passages that mention Ukraine only as one member of a multi-country grouping (partially relevant) and metadata that repeats tokens or uses outdated phrasing ("the Ukraine") or alternative spellings—these are relevant but require careful interpretation.
4835	media	The query seeks survey items about people’s primary and secondary media use (TV, radio, online social media, websites, written press) and their attitudes toward how the media represent diversity (gender, age, disability, ethnic origin, religion/belief, sexual orientation) and the prominence/coverage of researchers and scientific research. In short, it aims to measure media consumption patterns and perceptions of diversity and science coverage in the media.	A document is relevant to this query if it contains survey materials, codebooks, dataset variables, or questionnaire text about media use and how diversity or scientific research are represented in the media — for example QP16A/B items asking which media people use most often (TV, radio, online social media, internet websites, written press) and QC12/QE11 items on whether diversity by age, gender, disability, ethnic origin, religion or sexual orientation is reflected. Documents that explicitly list variable codes (v532, v539, v316, etc.), response categories (e.g. “age under 25,” “none,” “don’t know”), or questions about the place of researchers and research in media coverage are especially relevant. Non-relevant documents mention the word “media” in other senses (e.g. biological growth media, multimedia file formats, marketing media kits) or only use “media” in passing without the survey/diversity context. Edge cases include files with only raw variable codes or repeated noisy text — these can be partly useful if labels or question text can be recovered, but are lower relevance than a clean questionnaire or annotated codebook.
49615	digitalization	User wants to identify and extract measures of digitalization in the ISSP integrated datasets — specifically self‑assessed digital tech skills (in daily life, for current/ future jobs, online learning, use of online public services) and perceptions of digital technologies' impact on the economy, society, and quality of life. They also need the associated metadata and identifiers for cross‑national analysis (CASEID, ISO‑3166 country/subsample codes, year of birth, occupation and sample codes).	This paragraph is relevant to the keyword "digitalization" because it repeatedly mentions digital technologies and concrete survey items about digital tech skills (e.g., "RESPONDENT DIGITAL TECH SKILLS IN DAILY LIFE," "USE ONLINE PUBLIC SERVICES," "DIGITAL ONLINE LEARNING") and about perceived impacts on economy, society and quality of life — useful when the query seeks empirical measures or survey data on digitalization. It also contains dataset-specific metadata (variable names like qd1/qd4, CASEID, ISO country codes, ISSP module years) that makes it especially valuable for researchers who want to locate or reuse survey variables and sampling information. It is non-relevant if the user is searching for conceptual definitions, implementation guides, policy recommendations or case studies of digital transformation, because the text is largely a codebook-style listing and repetitive metadata rather than explanatory prose or practical advice. Edge cases: a document that mentions "digital" only in the context of ID numbers or file formats could trigger the keyword but not actually address digitalization as a social or economic process; conversely, this text might be highly relevant for someone mapping indicators of digitalization but misleading for someone wanting how-to guidance. To judge relevance quickly, prefer passages with survey questions and impact measures for empirical queries, and ignore documents that only contain administrative codes or file-structure details if you need conceptual or applied information.
50072	digital	The user wants metadata and definitions for ISSP survey variables about digital technology, specifically respondents’ self‑assessed digital skills (daily life, job, future job, online learning, use of online public services) and perceived impact of recent digital technologies on the economy, society, and quality of life. They also need information on related identifiers and coding (CASEID respondent IDs, year of birth codes, country/ISO and subsample codes, occupation codes) and how these are formatted across ISSP waves.	A document is relevant to the keyword "digital" when it clearly discusses digital technologies, digital skills, online learning or public services, or measures the impact of recent digital tech on economy, society, or quality of life — for example, a survey codebook defining variables like "RESPONDENT DIGITAL TECH SKILLS" (qd4) or "RECENT DIGITAL TECH IMPACT" (qd1) is highly relevant because it provides content and measurement context. Documents that include substantive discussion, definitions, survey questions, respondent answers, or policy analysis about digital adoption and skills rank highest. Non-relevant items include files that only contain the substring "digital" as part of an identifier or repeated token with no explanatory text, materials about CASEID/ISO codes that are unrelated to technology, or uses of "digital" in other senses (e.g., relating to fingers or the plant digitalis). Edge cases include listings where variable names contain "digital" but lack descriptions (moderately relevant), documents in other languages or abbreviated metadata that mention "digital" only once (low relevance), and false positives like phrases containing "digit" (e.g., "3 digit ISO code") which should not be treated as topical. In short, relevance should be judged by contextual depth and topical focus on digital technologies rather than mere keyword occurrence.
50270	digital skills	A summary of survey variables measuring respondents' self‑assessed digital technology skills across contexts (in daily life, for current job, for future job, for online learning, for using public services) along with related metadata (country ISO codes, respondent ID/caseid, year of birth, occupation codes) and items on perceived impacts of recent digital technologies. The information need is to locate and understand these digital‑skills items and their coding/availability in the ISSP datasets.	A document is relevant to the query "digital skills" when it explicitly contains measures or question text about individuals' ability to use digital technologies—e.g., qd4 items such as "RESPONDENT DIGITAL TECH SKILLS IN DAILY LIFE," "TO DO JOB," "TO DO FUTURE JOB," "DIGITAL ONLINE LEARNING," or the self‑assessment phrasing "You consider yourself to be sufficiently skilled in the use of digital technologies." Material about the broader impacts of digital technology (qd1 items on economy, society, quality of life) is related but only indirectly relevant unless it also reports on respondents' actual skills. Documents that only contain administrative metadata—CASEID, ISO country codes, year of birth, occupation codes, or repeated variable codes without any skill items—should be considered non‑relevant. Borderline cases include codebooks or survey documentation that list qd4 variable names without item wording (partially relevant) and noisy, duplicated exports where the qd4 items are present but buried among repeated metadata (relevant but lower quality for extraction).
505	diskriminierung	The user wants to identify the primary reason for discrimination experienced in their main occupation, corresponding to survey variable EB0215P. They are seeking a concise answer listing or selecting the main motive (e.g., gender, age, ethnicity, religion, disability) that best explains the discrimination.	A document is relevant if it explicitly contains the EB0215P variable or question text asking “What was the main reason for discrimination in your main activity?” and provides a clear answer or coding for that main reason. Relevant examples include transcripts or datasets that list a respondent’s single primary reason (e.g., gender, ethnicity/race, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, nationality, language, political opinion) or a codebook that defines EB0215P categories and their labels. Partially relevant documents are translations, synonyms, aggregated frequency tables, or metadata that map directly to EB0215P (these are useful but may lack individual-level answers). Non-relevant documents are ones that only discuss discrimination in general, address other survey variables or paragraphs (e.g., EB0216), provide legal/policy analysis without the EB0215P question, or mention multiple causes without identifying which was the “main” reason. Edge cases to watch for include missing/null responses, entries that list several reasons without indicating the primary one, and near-matches where phrasing differs (Hauptgrund vs. Haupttätigkeit) — these reduce relevance unless they clearly tie back to the EB0215P question.
50992	digitalisierung arbeit	User wants survey questions, variables and statistics about how digitalization affects work — e.g., job satisfaction, teleworking or working at different locations, time pressure, part-time work, public vs. private sector differences, self‑employment networks and managerial responsibilities. They are trying to find relevant survey items and data to analyze the relationship between digitalization and working conditions.	A document is relevant to the query "digitalisierung arbeit" when it explicitly connects digitalisation (e.g., ICT adoption, automation, platform work, telework, digital workplace tools, or digital skills training) to employment issues such as changing job tasks, work organisation, job satisfaction, or skill requirements. The paragraph you provided mainly lists survey items about job satisfaction, workplace location, responsibility for others, and party performance, without mentioning digital technology, so it would generally be non‑relevant unless specific items or results tie those questions to digital work arrangements. Partial or borderline relevance arises when a text mentions “digital” only in passing (e.g., a single metadata tag) or discusses telework/remote work without framing it as a digital transformation issue—those require closer inspection of methods and findings. Another edge case is documents about digitising public administration: they are relevant only if they analyse effects on jobs, roles, or employee skills; otherwise they are about service delivery rather than "arbeit." To decide fast, prefer documents that contain concrete measures or outcomes linking technology and work (examples, statistics, interventions, or policy impacts); mark as non‑relevant if the content is only generic employment survey variables or political commentary with no digital context.
51730	alkohol	The user is seeking information about alcohol focused on survey-style measures and public attitudes. Specifically they want data/questions on drinking behavior (age of regular drinking onset, days with 5+ drinks in the past 30 days), perceptions of being detected when driving under the influence, and opinions on tougher penalties and alcohol as a social/political problem.	A document is relevant for the keyword "alkohol" when it contains substantive discussion of alcohol use, such as survey questions about drinking frequency or age of initiation, descriptions of binge drinking ("5 or more glasses" in the last 30 days), blood‑alcohol scenarios ("08 Promille"/0.8‰) or alcohol‑related offences and policy ("Alkohol am Steuer", higher fines from 2009). The supplied paragraph is highly relevant because it repeatedly names "ALKOHOL AM STEUER", asks about how often people drank, the age they began drinking regularly, and hypothetical detection probabilities for driving with high blood alcohol — all direct matches to search intent. It is less relevant when "alkohol" appears only as a single entry in a long, general topic list or as part of repeated metadata/codes (e.g. V75, cp02) without explanatory text, because those mentions lack substantive content. Edge cases to watch: mentions of "alcohol" in a chemical/industrial sense, negated forms like "alkoholfrei", translations or misspellings, or boilerplate repetitions — these can produce false positives or require downgrading despite containing the keyword.
5274	familie	The user is asking about "family" in the context of a workplace/survey topic — wanting to know who people count as family and how "family" is defined. They also seek views and information on reconciling work and family life (possibilities and employer provisions for balancing career and family).	A document is relevant to the query "familie" when it explicitly discusses family as a topic—for example the repeated survey items in this paragraph like "Was meinen Sie zum Thema Beruf und Familie" or the definitional prompt "WENN WIR HIER SO VON FAMILIE SPRECHEN AN WEN DENKEN SIE DABEI". Relevance is stronger when the term appears in headings, question text, or extended discussion (e.g., family–work reconciliation), not just as a stray token. Non-relevant documents would only contain the string as part of codes or labels (e.g., "V206 VEREINB. FAMILIE" with no substantive content), as a company/name unrelated to household/family topics, or only in irrelevant metadata. Edge cases include inflected or compounded forms (Familie, Familien, Beruf und Familie) and boilerplate or heavily duplicated text: such documents match the keyword but may offer little useful information unless context shows an actual discussion or question about family.
5275	democracy	A user searching "democracy" here is looking for how people view the idea of democracy itself—whether they support it and how essential they consider specific features (e.g., free elections, civil rights, gender equality, redistribution, welfare, military intervention, religious law, obedience to rulers). They likely want survey-style measures or questions and public-attitude data about which characteristics define or matter for democracy.	A document is relevant to the query "democracy" when it directly discusses the IDEA OF DEMOCRACY or how people understand and evaluate democratic characteristics — for example survey items that ask whether one is for or against democracy or to rate essential features on a 1–10 scale. Concrete indicators of relevance include explicit mentions of free elections, civil rights, equality of incomes, women's rights, taxing the rich/subsidizing the poor, military takeover when governments fail, religious authorities interpreting laws, or state unemployment aid, since these show which attributes are being judged as democratic. Format and context matter: transcripts or questionnaires that repeatedly prompt “in principle are you for or against the idea of democracy” or include question codes (Q39A, pd12, v14) are relevant but may be lower quality if they contain excessive duplication or metadata noise. Borderline or non-relevant cases include texts that only name “democracy” in passing (e.g., as a label, place, or slogan), documents focused solely on specific policy advocacy without tying those policies to the concept of democracy, or files that are mostly corrupted/redundant text and offer no substantive discussion of democratic ideas.
52895	inequality	The user is looking for survey-based information on social and gender inequality, including public attitudes about causes (e.g., benefits to the rich, lack of unions), responsibility, urgency, and preferred remedies. They also want measures of priorities for EU action, perceptions of change over time, and expectations about future inequality.	A document is relevant to the query "inequality" if it discusses inequality substantively — for example by naming types (gender, social-class, income), giving survey question text or variable labels (ISSP items like "Inequality continues to exist because it benefits the rich and powerful" or Q99 "means to reduce sex inequalities"), describing causes (lack of unions, benefits to the rich), policy responses (EU gender policy, priority areas) or trends over time (compared with 10 years ago, future importance). Highly relevant examples include pages that show ISSP question wording and variable codes (ZA1680, ZA3430, V9, V21), lists of urgent gender-inequality issues (being paid less, prejudice, underrepresentation in responsible positions), or explicit proposals for reducing inequality. A document is non-relevant if it only contains unrelated codes or noise (repeated variable IDs with no question text), discusses mathematical inequality symbols rather than social inequality, or only mentions "inequality" peripherally without substantive content. Edge cases include files that contain the right variable codes but omit full question wording (ambiguous for indexing), or documents that focus on one subtype (e.g., racial inequality) — still relevant but should be labeled for the specific subtype and timeframe. For useful retrieval, prefer documents that pair human-readable question text with variable identifiers, context (country, year), and whether the item addresses causes, impacts, or policy solutions.
5335	social media nutzung	Looking for information on social media usage in Germany — who uses which platforms, how often and for what purposes (communication, news, learning, entertainment), and how use varies by demographics and attitudes (privacy, copyright, civic participation).	A document is relevant to the query "social media nutzung" if it explicitly discusses use of social media platforms, behaviors on networks (frequency, purpose, demographics), platform features or policies, or mentions specific social platforms (e.g., YouTube, Facebook, Instagram) or user-generated content. For example, survey items about "Nutzung von Informationsangeboten im Internet," questions mentioning YouTube, or debates about platform liability for copyrighted material are likely relevant because they touch on how people use online platforms. Documents about social benefits, tax policy, coal mining (Lützerath), or household net income are non-relevant unless they directly link those topics to social media use. Edge cases include generic references to "internet use" or "Nutzung von Informationsangeboten" without naming social networks — these are weakly relevant and require context to decide — and copyright/Internet-platform items, which become relevant only when they explicitly involve social media or user uploads.
5377	social media use	A survey asking whether respondents follow debates on social media, how they evaluate media coverage of poverty and social exclusion, which media sources they use most often (first and second), and whom they would contact if their social media or email account were hacked.	Relevant: this paragraph explicitly contains the question "Do you follow debates on social media..." and media-use variables (qp16a/qp16b) that list "ONLINE SOCIAL MEDIA" and other media types, so it directly matches a query about social media use. It also includes coding labels and response options (e.g., television, internet websites, radio, written press) which are useful if you want the survey wording or item coding for social media-frequency research. Non-relevant: much of the text is duplicated and noisy and many lines concern other topics (questions about how the media cover poverty, cybercrime contacts for hacked accounts) that are adjacent but not central to measuring social media use. Edge cases: treat this document as relevant when you need questionnaire items, variable names or examples of response options, but not relevant if you expect aggregated usage statistics, analytic results, or cleanly formatted data; the repetition and mixed topics mean you’ll need to clean or extract the social-media items before analysis.
53774	berufsausbildung	User wants to know whether a person (self or the household's main earner) has a completed vocational training ("abgeschlossene Berufsausbildung") and how that status is asked or recorded on forms (e.g., the question "Haben Sie eine abgeschlossene Berufsausbildung?").	A document is relevant when it explicitly records or asks about a completed vocational training — i.e., contains the phrase “abgeschlossene Berufsausbildung” or close variants and survey field labels such as v75, v154, V294, V295, zu02, etc., or headings like “Haben Sie eine abgeschlossene Berufsausbildung”, “EIGENE BERUFSAUSBILDUNG” or “BERUFSAUSBILDUNG DES HAUPTERNÄHRERS.” Examples of highly relevant material are questionnaires, census forms, or database fields that store answers to that exact question or its abbreviations (e.g., “ABGESCHL. BERUFSAUSBILD.”, “ABGESCHL.BERUFSAUSBILDG.”). Documents are not relevant if they only mention general education or other credentials (university degree, continuing education), discuss ongoing or incomplete training (e.g., “Ausbildung abgebrochen” or “in Ausbildung”), are in unrelated languages, or contain the term only as OCR noise or repeated metadata without substantive content. Edge cases include synonymous wording (“Lehre”, “Ausbildung abgeschlossen”), foreign/recognized vocational qualifications, or records that contain the field codes but lack answer content; these should be reviewed individually to decide if they meet the query intent.
5407	medien	The user is looking for public-opinion survey items and measures about the media — e.g., how often people use TV/press/radio/internet and social media for political information, perceptions of media bias and influence (including coverage of politicians and scandals), and attitudes toward media reporting on topics like right‑wing extremism, gender‑inclusive language, DDR coverage, and whether people contacted authorities or the media about grievances. They need concise examples of questions assessing media use, trust, perceived fairness, and topic interest.	A document is relevant for the keyword "medien" when it directly discusses media as an institution or information source — for example when it reports on media coverage of politicians (Christian Wulff, Michel Friedman, Peer Steinbrück, Gerhard Schröder), asks how often people use television/newspapers/radio/the Internet for political information, or surveys opinions about media influence, right‑wing extremism in the media, or gender‑neutral language in the media. The provided paragraph is highly relevant because it repeatedly names "Medien" in questions about coverage, frequency of use, influence on political opinion, and social media as an information source, and even contains concrete survey items (e.g. ZA5573 2008) and topical examples. Non‑relevant documents would only contain "Medien" as a field label or code (V270, V311) with no substantive text, use "medien" as a substring in unrelated words, or discuss other kinds of media (e.g. biological culture media, multimedia file formats) that are not about news/communication. Edge cases include survey forms that mention "soziale Medien" but focus on other topics (relevant but lower priority), duplicate boilerplate lines (add little new information), and multilingual corpora where "medien" appears incidentally — these should be checked for actual topical content before scoring them as fully relevant.
54621	beschäftigungsverhältnis	The user is looking for wording to determine a person's current employment relationship—specifically the type of contract and whether it is fixed‑term—and to ask if they searched for paid work in the past four weeks (including those currently in permanent jobs). This is likely for survey or questionnaire items about employment status and recent job‑search activity.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses the German survey phrasing and concepts in the query — for example it contains the questions "In welchem Beschäftigungsverhältnis stehen Sie?", "Ist Ihr Beschäftigungsverhältnis befristet?", or wording about "Suche nach bezahlter Tätigkeit in den letzten 4 Wochen", or if it includes the variable codes (v05001, w06001, etc.) with definitions. Highly relevant examples are questionnaire forms, survey codebooks, data dictionaries or methodology notes from labor force surveys that list those exact items and response categories (e.g., fixed-term vs. permanent, searching for paid work). Non-relevant documents include general articles on employment law or job market trends that do not specify contract type or recent job-search behavior, job postings, or texts about unpaid/volunteer work that use different timeframes or criteria. Edge cases include documents that mention "befristet" or "Beschäftigungsverhältnis" in a different legal/sectoral context, items that refer to job-seeking without clarifying "paid" or the "last 4 weeks", or datasets that list variable codes without accompanying question text — these may be partially relevant if you can map codes to questions but are weaker than full question-and-response documentation.
54995	arbeitgeber	A summary of employer–employee relations and policies, particularly employer countermeasures to strikes (lockouts) and public opinion on whether employers should be allowed to lock out workers. Also seeks routine employment details and contract information—start date, written vs. oral agreement, control over working hours, supervisory responsibility, and employer contributions to social/care insurance.	A document is relevant to the query "arbeitgeber" when it explicitly discusses employers or employer-related actions, roles, policies, or survey questions — for example mentions of "Arbeitgeber", "Arbeitgeberbeitrag", lockouts ("Aussperrung"), employer-determined working hours, start dates with the current employer, or whether an employer pays part of insurance costs. Passages that pose questions about being employed by or responsible for others, that describe employer–union agreements, or that record employer contributions are good evidence of relevance. Conversely, a document is non-relevant if the word appears only in passing (e.g., as a fragmentary code label like V120), in boilerplate lists without substantive context, or as an unrelated name in a directory. Edge cases include compound terms and synonyms ("Firma", "Dienstherr", "Arbeitgeberbeitrag"), different word forms or languages (German vs English), and texts about employers in peripheral contexts (taxation, historical mentions) where the match may be superficial; examining nearby verbs, policy terms, or question formats helps disambiguate intent.
55053	arbeit zufriedenheit	The user is seeking survey measures and questions related to work satisfaction, including willingness to work even when not searching for a job, frequency of working under time pressure, and collaboration among self‑employed. They also want items about perceived government competence (federal or state, party-led governments) in solving economic and public‑policy problems to the respondent’s satisfaction.	A document is relevant to the query "arbeit zufriedenheit" if it directly addresses individual job satisfaction or work conditions — for example survey items about working under time pressure, willingness to work even when not seeking a job, collaboration in a self-employed network, or explicit phrases like "Arbeitszufriedenheit" or "Wie oft arbeiten Sie ... unter Zeitdruck." The paragraph contains several clearly relevant lines (e.g., "Wie oft arbeiten Sie bei der Erledigung Ihrer Arbeit unter Zeitdruck" and "Auch wenn Sie keine Arbeit suchen würden Sie dennoch gerne arbeiten"), and its German wording matches the query language, which increases relevance. It is non-relevant when the text focuses on political or fiscal topics (e.g., which government can fix the federal budget, party labels like CDU/SPD, economy or terrorism questions) that do not concern personal work satisfaction. Edge cases include texts that mention "Arbeit" in a political sense ("Arbeit der Regierung") or "Zufriedenheit" with government performance — these are false positives unless they also include individual-level job satisfaction items; mixed documents that contain both political and work-satisfaction questions can be partially relevant, with relevance proportional to the amount and prominence of the job-related items.
55130	arbeitsbedingungen	The query seeks survey items about working conditions in a person’s main job, asking how often various adverse conditions occur and to what extent the job is characterized by them. Key factors queried include heavy physical work, workplace stress, shift work, poor work climate, noise/poor air, long working hours, and time/performance pressure.	A document is relevant to the query "arbeitsbedingungen" when it explicitly addresses working conditions or lists exposures such as Schichtarbeit (shift work), schwere körperliche Arbeit (heavy physical work), Lärm, schlechte Luft, lange Arbeitszeit, Leistungsdruck, or workplace stress — for example, survey items beginning "Wie oft..." or stems like "Ist Ihre jetzige berufliche Tätigkeit..." are direct indicators of relevance. It is non‑relevant when the content only contains unrelated administrative codes, formatting artifacts, repeated boilerplate with no substantive information, or primarily concerns pay, hiring, or job titles without any reference to working conditions. Edge cases include documents made up of variable names and abbreviations (e.g. "Arbeitsbed.", "V294", "hw05"): these often signal a questionnaire or codebook and can be relevant for measurement purposes, but may be borderline if they contain no question wording or explanatory context. Prioritize texts that provide full question wording, frequency scales, or descriptive discussion of exposures; treat isolated metadata or duplicate lines as lower priority unless you specifically need the instrument or coding details.
55428	arbeit	The user is looking for an overview and explanation of German survey items and variables about work/employment — including job satisfaction, willingness to keep working, working under time pressure, part‑time reasons, job search, workplace responsibilities, public vs. private sector comparisons, work location, and how jobs were found. They likely want translations, definitions, or a mapped list of those survey questions/variable codes.	A document is relevant to the query "arbeit" when it directly addresses employment- or work-related topics such as job satisfaction, working conditions, survey items about working under time pressure, part‑time employment reasons, voluntary continued work (e.g. "Angenommen Sie bekämen weiter Ihr Geld... freiwillig weiter zu arbeiten"), country of work, or comparisons between public and private sector employment; questionnaire forms, labor‑force statistics, HR policies and survey code lists (V99, V90, Q16, V922 etc.) are strong matches. Relevant examples include a survey instrument containing questions like "Wie zufrieden sind Sie alles in allem genommen mit Ihrer Arbeit", a research report on time pressure at work, or a dataset column list describing employment variables. Non‑relevant documents merely containing the string "Arbeit" but about other domains—physics/engineering work (mechanical Arbeit = force×distance), artistic works, metaphorical uses, or pages where the word appears only in passing or as noise—should be excluded. Edge cases to watch for are bilingual documents or translated questionnaires (German/English), political items that ask whether parties "do their work" (e.g. "Macht die SPD in der Bundesregierung ihre Arbeit") which may be borderline depending on intent, and terse codebooks where variable names (V99, V133) appear without explanatory text but still signal potentially relevant survey data.
56089	arbeitsleistung	The user wants to understand a German survey item asking whether their income is appropriate given their skills and work performance—i.e., what "Arbeitsleistung" means in this context and how to interpret or translate the question. They may be seeking a clear translation, definition, or guidance for answering the survey item.	A document is relevant to the keyword "arbeitsleistung" when it actually discusses work performance — for example evaluations of employee productivity, links between pay and performance, performance metrics, or self‑assessments of one’s Arbeitsleistung. The given paragraph directly asks whether income matches one’s abilities and Arbeitsleistung, so it is highly relevant because it contains the term in a substantive, topical question rather than only as metadata. Non‑relevant documents might only contain the token as a repeated label or code (e.g., V192, V390) or use the word in an unrelated technical sense (like machine output) without addressing human work performance. Edge cases include survey forms that list the phrase as a question but provide no further context, documents using synonyms or compounds (e.g., Arbeitsleistungsprämie) that require semantic matching, misspellings or translations, and duplicate boilerplate that inflates term frequency without adding meaningful content.
56749	antisemitism	Wants to measure public perceptions of antisemitism in a given country — specifically whether people consider it a problem and whether they believe it has increased, decreased, or stayed the same over the past five years.	A document is relevant if it directly addresses whether antisemitism is perceived as a problem in the specified country and whether that perception has changed over the past five years — for example national polls, NGO or government reports, survey questionnaires and their results, or news analyses explicitly asking or measuring those questions. Relevant examples include public-opinion surveys that ask “Is antisemitism a problem in our country?” and trend reports comparing perceptions year-by-year, as well as academic studies that analyze perceived increases or decreases in the last five years. Non-relevant documents are ones that only define antisemitism, discuss historical episodes outside the five-year window, treat antisemitism generically at a global level without country-specific perception data, or report individual incidents without linking them to overall public perception or trend analysis. Edge cases include crime-statistic reports and policy briefs — they are partially relevant if they tie numbers to public perception or show a five-year trend, and materials in other languages or using synonyms (e.g., “anti‑Semitism,” “Judeophobia”) should be considered relevant if they cover the same survey or trend questions.
57292	ausländer	The user is looking for survey questions and responses about "foreigners" in Germany, specifically whether a respondent has a parent born abroad and how people perceive relations between foreigners and Germans in their neighborhood. They also want opinions on immigration policy (whether entry/zuzug for foreigners should be eased or restricted) and general perceptions of most foreigners living in Germany.	A document is relevant to the keyword "ausländer" if it directly discusses foreigners, immigration, or attitudes toward foreigners—especially survey items asking about relationships between Ausländer and Germans, parental origin, or whether immigration should be eased or restricted. It is non-relevant if the term appears only incidentally (e.g., a single offhand mention), if the document focuses on an unrelated topic, or if "Ausländer" is used in a different sense (such as a surname, place name, or metaphor). Repetitive questionnaire text like the provided paragraph is still relevant because it contains the exact survey questions and response context, though duplicate lines reduce informational value. Edge cases include OCR or translation errors that fragment the word (e.g., "Ausl." or "Ausl ander") which may require normalization to match, and legal or historical documents that use related terms (e.g., "Ausländergesetz")—these can be relevant if the query intent is policy rather than social attitudes. Useful signals of relevance are presence of question phrasing, demographic fields, and policy wording; non-relevance signals are metaphorical uses, unrelated topics, or ambiguous homographs.
57703	arbeitsweg	The user is looking for a clear explanation of the survey item asking whether health problems would make it difficult to get to their workplace. In other words, it seeks to determine if physical or health-related limitations would prevent or complicate commuting to a job.	A document is relevant to the keyword "arbeitsweg" if it directly addresses the commute or the ability to reach the workplace — for example survey items like EF1092u1 or Frage 170 that ask “Hätten Sie bei einer Erwerbstätigkeit Probleme, Ihren Arbeitsplatz zu erreichen (Arbeitsweg)?” or text about mobility, public transport, driving, distance, or health-related barriers to commuting. Concrete markers of relevance include the exact phrasing shown, variable codes (EF1092u1), question numbers, and discussions of accessibility problems (e.g., mobility impairment, lack of transit). Non-relevant documents are those that only use the word in passing with a different meaning (metaphorical uses of “work path”), focus solely on pay/reimbursement rules without commute context, or contain the token as part of unrelated metadata. Edge cases include texts with encoding artifacts (e.g., “auml”) or translations — these can still be relevant if the surrounding context clearly describes reaching the workplace; similarly, synonyms like “Anfahrtsweg” or the phrase “Arbeitsplatz erreichen” should be treated as relevant even if the exact keyword form is absent.
58154	gesundheitszustand	The query seeks the meaning and typical survey phrasing of the German term "Gesundheitszustand"—specifically how to ask people to rate their general health (e.g., "How would you describe your state of health in general?"). The user likely needs a clear translation or alternative phrasings for use in questionnaires or interviews.	This document is highly relevant to the query "gesundheitszustand" because it repeatedly contains the exact keyword and numerous direct survey items asking respondents to describe their general state of health, including variants such as "Wie würden Sie Ihren Gesundheitszustand im Allgemeinen beschreiben" and child-focused prompts ("Wie ist der Gesundheitszustand des Kindes im Allgemeinen"). The presence of survey variable codes (e.g., hs01, V241) and repeated question forms indicates it is part of a questionnaire or instrument, which is useful when the user wants examples of how health-status questions are worded. It becomes less relevant if the occurrence of the term is only incidental (for example a news story briefly mentioning someone’s Gesundheitszustand) or if the document only lists metadata codes without the actual question text or response options. Edge cases include mixed documents that combine survey items with news about a public figure’s health (e.g., Angela Merkel): those are partly relevant for wording examples but may be misleading if the user seeks aggregated measurements or answers rather than question wording.
5830	politisches wissen	A concise description: The user wants to measure political knowledge and engagement—whether respondents can identify local politicians (name, party, residence), recall who said particular statements, and report which party (CDU or SPD) they think can solve problems like unemployment. They also want information on respondents' political activity frequency and family voting patterns.	A document is relevant to the keyword "politisches wissen" when it explicitly measures or discusses citizens' factual political knowledge — for example asking respondents to name their elected representative, identify which party (CDU or SPD) could solve unemployment, recall dates of events, or report which party a family member typically votes for. The provided paragraph contains many such survey items (questions about unemployment, party responsibility, the name or party of the elected MP), so those parts are clearly relevant. Text that is non‑relevant would focus only on administrative script, repeated interviewer instructions, or on political attitudes and participation frequency without any factual knowledge tests. Edge cases include materials that mention "politisches Wissen" but only discuss political interest or behavior (these are partially relevant), or heavily noisy/transcribed documents where the substantive knowledge questions are buried among repetitions — such documents are relevant in substance but lower quality and may require cleaning.
5843	populism	A search for "populism" seeks a clear, concise explanation of the concept—its defining features, causes, and political forms—and how populist movements or leaders operate and affect democracy. The user may also want examples (historical and contemporary), typical rhetoric and policies, and how populism relates to issues like immigration, minority rights, and economic insecurity.	A document is relevant to the query "populism" when it explicitly addresses populist ideas (people-versus-elite rhetoric, anti-establishment or charismatic leader claims, majoritarianism) or contains empirical measures that are commonly used to identify populist sentiment—for example, attitudes toward immigration, minority rights, economic grievance, or support for outsider parties. The paragraph’s many survey items about minority rights, estimates of immigrant proportions, poverty, and food-sufficiency concerns are potentially relevant because populist movements often mobilize around anti-immigrant sentiment and perceptions of economic threat. However, this text appears primarily to be a questionnaire/codebook (ISSP 2008 Norway) with repeated variable labels and metadata; that makes it only peripherally relevant unless the responses are analyzed to show links to populist voting or rhetoric. Purely technical content—variable codes, repeated prompts, sample-size notes, or population totals—is not itself evidence of populism and should be considered non-relevant unless tied to substantive analysis. To judge relevance in practice, prioritize documents that either analyze survey responses for populist attitudes or directly discuss populist actors, discourse, or mobilization.
58596	gesundheit arbeit	The searcher wants information about how work affects health—whether job-related physical strains or occupational health problems limit activity at work or home, cause sick leave, and how people rate their overall health. They are likely looking for survey questions or measures (often referencing the past 12 months) that assess work-related health issues and concerns about specific risks like BSE or coronavirus.	A document is relevant to the query "gesundheit arbeit" when it explicitly links health and work — for example, survey items or text asking whether a person is exposed at work to physical strains that could harm their health, whether a work-related health problem limits them at work or home, or how long they could not work because of an occupational health issue (phrases in the paragraph like "Sind Sie bei Ihrer Arbeit körperlichen Belastungen ausgesetzt..." or "Wie lange konnten Sie wegen Ihres arbeitsbedingten Gesundheitsproblems ... nicht arbeiten" are strong signals). It is non-relevant when "Gesundheit" and "Arbeit" appear only separately or as isolated metadata (e.g., repeated codes like I046, V692) or when the health topic (BSE, coronavirus, spoiled meat) is discussed purely as a general/public-health item with no workplace context. Edge cases include survey codebooks or repeated questionnaire batteries: these are relevant if you seek measurement of occupational health (they show the exact questions asked), but less useful if you are searching for clinical studies, workplace interventions, or epidemiological evidence. In short, prioritize documents that describe the work–health nexus (occupational exposures, work limitations, duration of work absence) and deprioritize materials that only incidentally mention health or work without connecting them.
59281	geschlechterrolle	The user is looking for information about "Geschlechterrolle" (gender roles)—a concise explanation of the social norms and expectations that assign behaviors and responsibilities to men and women, particularly within families. They may also be seeking the ISSP 2012 international survey on family and gender roles, including the questionnaire and instructions for completing it.	A document is relevant to the keyword "geschlechterrolle" if it explicitly discusses gender roles, norms, expectations, or attitudes — for example survey items, analyses, or questions about "Familie und Geschlechterrollen" and how people view men’s and women’s responsibilities. The provided paragraph is highly relevant because it is a questionnaire instruction for an international social survey asking respondents about family and gender roles. Non-relevant material would be administrative boilerplate, repeated UI instructions, duplicates of the same form text, or cases where the word appears only in metadata or as a different meaning (e.g., a theatrical "role"). Edge cases include texts that use synonyms or translations (such as "gender norms," "gender division of labor," or English-language questionnaires) — these should be considered relevant even if the exact German term is absent — while documents that mention "role" in unrelated domains (legal roles, medical roles) are false positives.
59288	geschlechterrollen	The searcher wants a clear definition and overview of "gender roles" — the social norms and expected behaviors for men and women in family and society. They may also be looking for public opinion and research findings or cross‑country survey results (for example the ISSP 2012 questionnaire on family and gender roles).	A document is relevant to the query "geschlechterrollen" if it directly addresses gender roles—e.g., survey questions, empirical results, theoretical discussions, or policy analyses about expectations for men and women. The provided paragraph is partially relevant because it explicitly names "Familie und Geschlechterrollen" and describes an international questionnaire on that topic, but its content is largely administrative (instructions for filling in the questionnaire) rather than substantive findings or analysis. Documents that are non-relevant include boilerplate UI text, consent forms, navigation help, or repeated duplicates that mention the phrase only as a label without discussing attitudes, measures, or results. Edge cases include texts that use the word in a different sense (historical usage, book title, or index entry), materials about related topics like "family" or "gender equality" that do not deal with roles per se, and poor OCR/translations where the term appears erroneously; these may be borderline and require checking context to decide relevance.
6086	refugee	A set of survey questions measuring public attitudes toward refugees in Germany — asking whether refugees will bring more opportunities, more risks, or neither for the welfare state, economy, security, and social cohesion. It also asks whether politically repressed refugees should be allowed to stay and whether the EU should provide financial help to neighbouring countries to address internal conflicts.	This document is relevant because it explicitly asks survey questions about refugees — e.g., whether recent arrivals to Germany will create opportunities or risks for the welfare state, economy, security, and social cohesion — and also asks about political repression, asylum, and EU financial assistance for neighbours, all central refugee policy topics. It is less relevant if a text only uses the word “refugee” in passing or discusses unrelated migration issues (e.g., labor migrants or historical refugee events) without addressing attitudes, policy, or impacts. Relevance increases when the document contains substantive questions or labels (mp16, mp17, mp18, V52, QC6) that map to welfare/economy/security/social-cohesion and asylum policy; purely duplicated or malformed questionnaire text still counts if those core items are present. An edge case is a document that contains the survey stubs or metadata but no plain-language questions — these may be borderline relevant because the intent is clear but the content may be unusable for analysis. Conversely, documents focused on administrative codes or unrelated “refuge” usages (e.g., software, shelters for animals) should be considered non-relevant.
60915	führungskräfte	The user is looking for the meaning and context of the German term "Führungskräfte" and for a concise summary of repeated survey question wording asking whether the "right people" occupy leading positions in German politics and business. They likely want the historical wording variations (1977–2017) and a clear translation or explanation of that survey question.	A document is relevant to the keyword "Führungskräfte" if it explicitly discusses people in leadership or executive roles—e.g., corporate executives, political leaders, managers, or survey questions asking whether the “right people” occupy leading positions. Good examples include news articles about executive appointments, academic studies of managerial behavior, or public-opinion polls asking about “Leute in führender Stellung” or “Führungspositionen.” Documents are not relevant if they only use similar words in a different sense (for instance “führend” meaning “leading” in a descriptive way, or “Führerschein” which is unrelated), or if the term appears only once in passing without substantive discussion. Edge cases include texts about team captains or sports coaches (potentially relevant depending on user intent), historical questionnaire wording that repeats the phrase verbatim (relevant for tracking phrasing changes), and language/orthography variants (Führungskraft, Führungsposition, lowercase/uppercase, hyphenation) that should be treated as matches. In ranking, favor documents where the term appears in headings, abstracts, metadata, or in concentrated discussion about leadership roles rather than incidental mentions.
6092	refugees	A request for survey-style public attitudes about refugees in Germany: whether recent arrivals will create more opportunities, more risks, or neither for the welfare state, economy, security, and social cohesion over the next few years. Also seeks opinions on whether refugees who suffered political repression should be allowed to stay and whether the EU should fund efforts to help neighboring countries deal with internal conflicts.	A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses refugees and the specific topics in the query—questions or analysis about whether refugees create opportunities or risks for the welfare state, economy, security, and social cohesion, plus items on admitting people who suffered political repression and on EU financial help for neighbouring conflicts (for example, survey questionnaires, opinion polls, policy briefs or statistical reports covering those items). It is non-relevant if it only uses the word “refugee” in passing, discusses unrelated migration topics (e.g., general labor migration) without linking to asylum or the listed domains, or contains only metadata/variable codes or noise with no substantive items. Edge cases include documents about “migrants” or “internally displaced persons,” which may be partially relevant if they explicitly treat asylum status or the four domains, and historical or fictional mentions of refugees, which are usually not relevant to contemporary survey/policy questions. Repeated or duplicated question text (as in the paragraph) still counts as relevant because it contains the core survey items, though duplicates add no new information. Practical relevance signals are the presence of the keywords welfare/economy/security/social cohesion, references to political repression or EU neighbor aid, and a question/response format indicating a survey or public-opinion context.
61220	führungskraft	The user is looking for information about survey questions and public‑opinion results on whether the “right people” hold leadership positions (Führungskräfte) in German politics and business. They want clarification of the question wording used in different years (1977–2017) and the resulting trends or responses.	A document is relevant to the keyword "führungskraft" if it explicitly discusses managers or leaders (Führungskraft/Führungskräfte) — for example job ads seeking a Führungskraft, profiles of executives, academic studies of leadership, or survey questions asking whether the right people occupy leading positions in politics or business. Text that repeatedly contains the exact German survey wording you supplied (e.g., “Glauben Sie … die richtigen Leute in den führenden Positionen sind”) is highly relevant because it directly addresses perceptions of leadership. Documents are non‑relevant when the string appears only incidentally or as noise (OCR duplicates, codes like “V106”, or boilerplate repetition), when related words are used in different senses (e.g., Führung as tour guiding, or führend meaning “leading” in a descriptive rather than a role sense), or when the term appears only in metadata or an index without substantive content. Edge cases include translations or multilingual documents where the English term “manager/leader” is used instead of the German, and questionnaire archives that repeat the question across years — these can be partly relevant but may require checking adjacent sentences to confirm substantive discussion of leadership rather than mere structural repetition.
61312	führung	The user wants to know what the German term "Führung" means in the context of survey questions and how it’s used (e.g., managerial vs. supervisory roles). They are also looking to interpret or summarize poll items about a statutory female quota in leadership of large companies and public preferences about which party or leader should head governments (e.g., Merkel, SPD, CDU, Linke).	A document is relevant to the keyword "führung" when it substantively discusses leadership, management or supervisory roles — for example texts about corporate leadership ("in der Führung von größeren Unternehmen"), political leadership ("Regierung unter Führung der SPD/CDU") or occupational status ("als Führungs- oder Aufsichtskraft tätig"), and policy measures tied to leadership such as a "gesetzliche Frauenquote". Variants and compound forms matter: occurrences like "Führung", "Führungskraft", "unter Führung", "Führungs-" or hyphenated forms should all be counted as relevant, and surrounding words (e.g. Unternehmen, SPD, Frauenquote) help confirm the leadership sense. A document is non-relevant if the term appears only as formatting noise, repeated survey metadata, OCR errors, or in unrelated senses (e.g. tactical/sports phrasing like "in Führung liegen" or unrelated compounds) without substantive discussion of management or governance. Edge cases include negated or perfunctory survey questions (which mention "Führung" but add little content), translations where the term is rendered differently, and ambiguous contexts where surrounding terms must be used to decide true relevance.
61531	geschlecht und geschlechterrollen	The user wants a clear explanation of the difference between "sex" (biological characteristics) and "gender/gender roles" (socially constructed identities and expectations), plus guidance on how these concepts are labeled or measured in household survey data (e.g., variables like GESCHLECHT or "Welches Geschlecht haben Sie").	The query "geschlecht und geschlechterrollen" asks for material about gender (sex) and the social roles or expectations attached to gender. A document is highly relevant if it contains substantive discussion, analysis, or examples of both sex/gender and gender roles — for example an article comparing how men’s and women’s work is valued, or a survey report analyzing role attitudes by gender. The paragraph you supplied mostly repeats the label "Geschlecht" and survey variable codes (V504, V297, etc.), which makes it marginally relevant as evidence that sex/gender was recorded, but not relevant for "geschlechterrollen" unless those variables or surrounding text actually analyze roles; a codebook or raw field list without interpretation is low-value for the query. Edge cases include instances where "Geschlecht" appears in different senses (biological sex vs social gender), documents that use synonyms like "gender" or "Rollen," and noisy repetitions or metadata that mention gender without any discussion of roles.
61686	gender role attitudes	Asking where people think gender stereotypes are most widespread—e.g., in schools, the workplace, media, advertising, sport, politics, or elsewhere—to gauge public attitudes about the prevalence and sources of gender role stereotypes. The aim is to measure perceptions of how and where preconceived ideas about men’s and women’s roles contribute to inequality.	A document is relevant to the query "gender role attitudes" if it explicitly addresses beliefs about appropriate roles and behaviors for women and men, measures those beliefs (for example with survey questions), or analyzes how those attitudes vary by context or group. The paragraph contains the exact survey prompt "Preconceived ideas about the image and role of women and men... In your opinion where do you think gender stereotypes are most widespread" and lists response categories (schools, work, media, advertising, sport, politics, none, other, DK), which makes it directly relevant because it captures both the attitude being asked about and the contexts used to elicit responses. It also contains a lot of repeated metadata tokens and duplicative text (qb9, d10, v601 and repeated question lines); such noise reduces usefulness unless the document includes actual response data or analysis rather than only labels. Edge cases: a codebook that only supplies the question wording and response codes is partially relevant (useful for measurement) but less so than a dataset with responses or a paper interpreting those attitudes. Conversely, a text that merely mentions the word "gender" without discussing role expectations or attitudes would be non-relevant.
61734	gender role	The user wants to know in which settings gender stereotypes are most widespread (for example: schools, the workplace, media, advertising, sports, or politics). This could be to inform a survey response, research, or policy/action planning about where gender-role biases are most prevalent.	A document is relevant to the query "gender role" when it directly addresses expectations, stereotypes, or social functions associated with women and men — for example discussions of how gender roles operate in schools, workplaces, media, politics, sports, or advertising, or analyses of how those roles produce inequalities. Items that present survey questions or coded categories about where stereotypes occur (e.g., entries about schools, media, work, sports) are relevant if they include explanation, results, or interpretation rather than just labels. Conversely, material that only repeats the word "gender" or contains administrative codes (qb9, d10, v601) and duplicated filler text without substantive description is non‑relevant. Edge cases include documents that mention gender only as a demographic variable (e.g., in clinical data) — these are partially relevant only if they link that variable to role expectations or stereotype effects — and long lists of response labels or truncated survey prompts, which are relevant only when accompanied by analysis or respondent answers.
61761	gender roles	A person searching "gender roles" is seeking a clear definition of gender roles/gender stereotypes and how these preconceived ideas about men and women contribute to inequalities. They likely want examples of where such stereotypes are most widespread (e.g., schools, work, media, advertising, politics, sports) and to understand their impacts.	A document is relevant to the keyword "gender roles" when it explicitly addresses social expectations, stereotypes, or prescribed behaviors for men, women, and other gender identities — for example discussions of how schools, workplaces, media, sports, politics, or advertising shape or reinforce gendered roles. Empirical materials such as survey questions, coding labels (e.g., qb9 entries about "gender stereotypes in schools/work/media") or analyses of examples from advertising or sport are highly relevant because they show where and how roles are enacted. Documents that are not relevant merely repeat the word "gender" as a tag or include boilerplate text without substantive commentary, or they focus exclusively on biological sex or medical issues without treating social roles. Edge cases include questionnaire dumps or duplicated survey prompts: those are useful if the user needs raw data or survey design, but less useful for someone seeking theoretical explanation or rich case studies; likewise, a piece narrowly about one context (e.g., gender roles in sports) is relevant but may miss broader generalizations.
6177	erziehung	The query seeks how parents prioritize specific child-rearing goals—such as independence, school success, diligence, good manners, assertiveness, empathy, responsibility, self‑confidence, and openness to criticism—when raising a roughly 10‑year‑old. It also asks about the role and importance of religious education in the family’s upbringing and current parenting.	A document is relevant to the keyword "erziehung" when it directly discusses child‑rearing or parenting goals, practices, or evaluations — for example when it lists specific upbringing objectives (self‑reliance, good school performance, diligence, manners, assertiveness, responsibility, self‑confidence, willingness to accept criticism, understanding of others) or asks respondents to rate their importance for a ~10‑year‑old. Texts that present survey items or instructions about how to judge these aims (e.g., “use the scale on the cards”) and explicit mentions of the role of religious education are clearly on‑topic. Non‑relevant documents either use “Erziehung” in a different sense (e.g., institutional school policy, teacher training) or contain only isolated or incidental occurrences of the word without any parenting context. Edge cases include machine‑readable exports or repeated code labels (fe01, fe05, V494) which are relevant if they can be mapped to the described parenting goals but less useful if they lack explanatory labels; similarly, mentions of “religious education” may be ambiguous between family practice and institutional religion and should be examined for intent.
62289	generation y	User seeks survey-based information on Generation Y’s political behaviour and personal values — specifically which party they voted for in the most recent general election and how important they consider aspects like family, work, friends, religion, leisure, politics and living with a partner. They also want attitudes about the effects on children of family changes (divorce, single-parent households, and remarriage).	A document is relevant to the query "generation y" when it explicitly addresses Generation Y (Millennials) — e.g., uses the labels Generation Y, Gen Y, or Millennials, or gives birth-year ranges or age bands (commonly born ~1981–1996) so the cohort can be identified. Relevant content usually examines Millennial-specific behaviours and attitudes such as voting patterns, political party choice in recent general elections, personal priorities (family, work, leisure, religion, friends), living arrangements (living with partner, one-parent households), or beliefs about effects on children, especially when results are reported for that cohort. Non-relevant documents include generic survey instruments or repeated question codes (v656, v688, Q92, etc.) that list items like “Which party did you vote for?” with no age/cohort information, pieces focused solely on other generations, or texts where “Y” is just a variable name and not a cohort label. Edge cases to watch for: articles that only mention Millennials in passing or give national-level results without age breakdowns are only partially relevant; documents that use synonyms (Millennial, Gen Y) or specify birth years without the label are relevant, while documents with ambiguous shorthand (just “Y”) require confirmation of meaning before counting as relevant.
62491	generation	Asks respondents which party they voted for in the most recent General Election. Also requests ratings of how important various personal domains (partner, family, friends, work, religion, leisure, politics) are and whether certain family situations (divorce, living with one parent, remarriage with a new child) have generally positive or negative effects on children.	A relevant document will explicitly ask which party the respondent voted for at the most recent general election (e.g., “Which party did you vote for at the last General Election of [month/year]?”) or contain the same survey variables/IDs (v656, v688, v482, v1298, etc.), plus the related blocks about personal importance (family, work, friends, religion, leisure, politics) and child‑outcome questions (effects of divorce, living with one parent, remarrying). Items that reproduce the question wording, response categories, coding instructions, or respondent‑level answers are highly relevant because they map directly to the query’s content. A document that only mentions “voting behaviour” in generic terms, only records turnout (did you vote) without asking “which party,” or only discusses unrelated elections or years would be less relevant or borderline. Edge cases include templates or headers that repeat the question text without answer options (partly relevant), translations or paraphrases of the same questionnaire (still relevant), and metadata lists of variable names with no question text (low relevance).
6267	abtreibung	Looking for survey items and variable codes that measure public attitudes toward abortion—specifically whether respondents approve or disapprove of abortion in different scenarios (unmarried woman, fetal handicap, threat to the mother’s life, couple not wanting more children). The query likely aims to map or interpret the dataset variables/questions (e.g., V229, AT46, Q53D) that record these approval/disapproval responses.	A document is relevant when it contains the actual survey items, codebook entries or questionnaire text about abortion attitudes — for example the German phrases “Abtreibung,” “Beurteilung Abtreibung,” or question stems like “Billigen Sie eine Abtreibung unter den folgenden Umständen…,” and the specific scenario items (child likely handicapped, mother’s life endangered, woman unmarried, couple doesn’t want more children) or the variable IDs shown (V229, Q53D, V178, AT46, etc.). Relevant examples include survey questionnaires, variable documentation, codebooks, dataset metadata, or translated question lists that reproduce those exact items and response options (approve/disapprove). A document is non‑relevant if it only discusses abortion medically or legally without reporting survey question wording or variable codes, if it merely mentions “abortion” tangentially, or if it lists unrelated variables that do not match the displayed item codes and scenarios. Edge cases: aggregated reports that give results for these items but omit the original question wording or response coding are partially relevant (useful for results but not for wording), while documents containing the codes but corrupted OCR or missing scenario text may be ambiguous and require inspection to confirm relevance.
6322	klima	The user is looking for information about "klima" (climate) in the context of survey and media-topic data — specifically public interest in climate/weather disasters and coded media topics, and survey responses on whether recent floods are attributed to climate change. They likely want the relevant survey question results, coding categories (e.g. Klima/Wetterkatastrophen, Hochwasser), and summary statistics on public belief about climate-change causes of flooding.	A document is relevant to the keyword "klima" when it explicitly discusses climate or climate change — e.g., occurrences of "Klima", "Klimaveränderung", "Klima Wetterkatastrophen" or sentences like "das Hochwasser ist hauptsächlich eine Folge der Klimaveränderung" that link weather events to climate. Lists of media topics that contain entries such as "Klima Wetterkatastrophen" or repeated mentions of "Hochwasser" in the context of climate are also strong relevance signals. A document is non‑relevant if "klima" appears only as a numeric code, a stray token, or in a different sense (for example "political climate" or an unrelated compound where meaning is ambiguous) without substantive climate content. Edge cases include negated statements (people saying flooding is not due to climate change—which are still relevant because they address climate perceptions), OCR/truncation errors like "KLIMAVERäND", and language issues (German text is fine, but ensure the term is used in climate sense). For ranking, give higher weight to prominent, repeated, or contextualized mentions (headlines, survey questions, or explanatory sentences) and lower weight to single incidental occurrences.
63419	islam	The query asks for a personal opinion on whether German state schools should offer Islamic religious instruction (as opposed to only Christian instruction or no religious instruction) and asks respondents to indicate agreement or disagreement with a series of statements about Islam and Muslims (e.g., whether Muslims cause conflicts, whether Muslim faith should be limited or monitored by the state, whether Islam fits into German society, and whether a Muslim mayor would be acceptable).	A document is relevant to the query "islam" if it substantively discusses Islam or Muslims — for example debates about Islamic religious instruction in state schools, public attitudes toward Muslim mayors, or policy measures like monitoring Muslim communities or limiting the exercise of Muslim faith. Strong relevance is signaled by explicit phrases such as "Islamic religious instruction," "Muslim children," "state schools," "exercise of Muslim faith," or the survey/item codes (ma08, mm01–mm05) that map to these topics. A document is non-relevant if it only mentions Islam in passing, uses the word as an unrelated acronym, or contains duplicated boilerplate survey prompts without new content; however, a repetitive survey transcript that contains those exact items can still be relevant for analysis despite low narrative value. Edge cases include texts about general "religious instruction" that do not specify Muslims (less relevant) and multilingual or mis-tagged documents where the word appears but the substance is about a different issue (not relevant).
6370	klimawandel	The user is asking whether climate change is a serious problem, what its impacts will be for people in Germany, and whether the world is likely to succeed in limiting or reversing it (including whether they should be worried). They likely want a concise summary of causes, projected local impacts, and the prospects for mitigation and adaptation.	A document is relevant to the keyword "klimawandel" when it contains substantive discussion of climate change—its causes, impacts, mitigation, policy, or public opinion—especially if it focuses on Germany (e.g., an article titled "Ist der Klimawandel für uns in Deutschland..." or a survey analyzing German attitudes). Simple metadata or repeated headings such as "V265 Klimawandel gr. Problem" or long blocks of duplicate lines add little relevance unless they link to full content; for example, an index entry “V295 KLIMAWANDEL GR. PROBLEM” is less useful than a paragraph explaining why it’s a problem. Language and lexical variants matter: German terms, capitalization, synonyms like "Klimakrise" or English "climate change"/"global warming", and common OCR/misspellings should be matched to avoid false negatives, while question forms (“Ist der Klimawandel…?”) often indicate survey or opinion material that is still relevant. Edge cases include noisy schedule fragments ("in Woche 50"), repeated IDs, or transcript headers—these reduce standalone value but may be relevant if they point to substantive transcripts or linked articles, so deduplication and context checks are important.
6481	home office	A query for "home office Paragraph" is looking for survey questionnaire items and response codes about political authority (whether the Head of State can dismiss/demote or promote high‑ranking officers), the respondent’s job (e.g., professional officer) and the main business activity of their workplace. It also seeks items on awareness/use of EC information offices and aid agencies (ECHO, UNICEF, UNHCR, WFP, USAID), public computer access, access to dental care, use of tourist information offices, and attitudes/knowledge about smoking regulations.	A document is relevant to the query "home office" when it specifically addresses an office located in a private residence (e.g., working-from-home arrangements, home-based business classifications, home office tax deductions, or guidance on setting up a room as an office) or when the user likely means the proper noun "Home Office" (the government ministry) and the text discusses that department. Relevant examples include survey items that ask whether you work at home, references to a home-based establishment, or policies and services provided by a government Home Office. The paragraph above mostly lists generic or institutional "offices" — EC information offices in Brussels or Copenhagen, tourist information offices, dentist's office, public offices, and questions about computer use at public access points — which are non-relevant because they do not pertain to a residential workspace or the Home Office ministry. Edge cases to watch for: a line like "office ... where you work" can be relevant if elsewhere it specifies "at home" or "home-based," and documents that only contain the token "office" (codes, repeated inventory text, or translations like ECHO) are false positives unless they explicitly connect to "home" or the Home Office entity.
6499	politische bildung	The user seeks information on "politische Bildung" in the context of German public-opinion survey questions about education policy, government/coalition formation, and state budget priorities (cuts vs. investment). They likely want explanations of these survey items, summaries of public attitudes or trends, and how political parties and coalitions influence education funding and policy.	A document is relevant to the keyword "politische Bildung" when it explicitly addresses civic or political education topics — for example discussions of curricula for democracy education, party positions on school civics, state funding for civic programs, or surveys asking about opinions on political-education policy. Mentions of "Bildung" that concern education funding, investments in schooling, or statements like "SPD fordert deutliche Erhöhung staatlicher Investitionen in Bildung" are likely relevant because they tie education to public policy. Documents are non-relevant when "Bildung" is used in a different sense (e.g., the formation of a government: "Bildung einer Koalition") or when the text only concerns vocational training, internships, or general continuing education without political/civic content. Edge cases include texts that mention coalitions and party negotiations: these are relevant only if they contain explicit debate about political-education policy or curricula; otherwise they should be treated as irrelevant political procedural content. Duplicate or noisy survey fragments that repeat questions without substantive content about civic education should be deprioritized.
65758	hochschule	The user wants to establish whether a person studied at a Hochschule (higher‑education institution/university) and to capture details of their higher‑education history — institution type (e.g., university, technical university, pedagogical college, engineering school, art or design academy), which schools were attended, and whether the studies were completed. They also need related facts: the highest degree obtained, any later schooling, the institution’s location (in Germany or which federal state), workplace/school location, and the commute distance.	A document is relevant to the keyword "hochschule" when it explicitly discusses higher education institutions or activities related to them — for example mentions of Universität, Technische Hochschule, Fachhochschule, Pädagogische Hochschule, Kunstakademie, studying, degrees, or enrollment questions like "Haben Sie an einer Hochschule studiert?". Relevant texts often include survey items about attendance, completion of studies, highest university degree, location of the institution (Bundesland, Germany), or commute distance to the Hochschule. Documents are non-relevant if "Hochschule" appears only incidentally (e.g., as part of a company name), if the focus is solely on primary/secondary schools, or if the term is used in an unrelated idiomatic sense. Edge cases include compound words and related terms (Hochschulreife, Hochschulabschluss), common abbreviations (TH, PH), German-language vs. translated text, or listings of institutions that do not address attendance or degrees — these may be borderline and require checking context to decide relevance.
6616	politische partizipation	The user wants to understand citizens' political participation and related attitudes — especially public opinions on the political course of parties (CDU/CSU, SPD, Greens), support for inter-party cooperation, views on the EU’s future, comparisons of political conditions since the DDR, and tolerance toward political opponents — likely to design or interpret survey questions measuring political engagement and party preferences.	A document is relevant to the keyword "politische Partizipation" when it directly addresses how citizens engage in politics — for example descriptions or measures of voting, party membership, protests, petitions, contacting officials, civic volunteering, or willingness to participate asked in surveys. Texts that only discuss party strategy or ideological shifts (e.g., whether the CDU is moving left, or whether the SPD’s course prevailed in coalition talks) are not relevant by themselves, because they focus on party positions rather than citizen engagement. Borderline cases include pieces on political attitudes or tolerance: these do not count as participation per se but can be relevant if they are analyzed as predictors of participatory behavior. Historical or institutional discussions (e.g., political conditions in the former DDR or EU governance changes) are relevant only when they explicitly link those contexts to changes in participation rates or opportunities. Finally, relevant documents often contain concrete indicators or survey items (e.g., “Did you vote?” “Have you attended a protest?” “Would you join a citizens’ initiative?”) rather than just general commentary about politics.
66195	environmental	A concise summary of public-opinion information about the environment: whether people feel they know more about environmental problems or solutions and want to learn more, whether they prioritize environmental protection versus economic competitiveness, and which sources or institutions (e.g., scientists, governments, media, companies, family, NGOs) they trust on environmental issues. The user is likely seeking or designing survey questions and/or analyzing public attitudes and trust related to environmental information and policy trade-offs.	A document is relevant to the keyword "environmental" if it contains substantive content about environmental topics — for example questions or text contrasting environmental problems vs solutions, attitudes toward environmental protection versus economic competitiveness, or which actors (scientists, governments, media, family, companies, NGOs) people trust on environmental issues. Short excerpts of survey items that explicitly ask “Do you know more about environmental problems or solutions?” or list trust options (scientists, newspapers, EU, companies, etc.) are clearly relevant because they address public knowledge, preferences and trust related to the environment. Documents are non‑relevant when they lack any environment-specific content (e.g., unrelated survey modules, generic metadata codes, or text about non‑environmental domains like health or education) or when the word “environmental” appears only as an attribute with no contextual meaning. Edge cases include code‑only records (e.g., Q48, Q45) which may be relevant if you can map the codes to survey questions, noisy/repeated transcriptions that are topically relevant but low quality, and ambiguous uses of “protection” or “problems” that refer to non‑environmental contexts.
6719	welfare	The user is looking for survey items and measures about "welfare," specifically public attitudes toward social welfare systems (coverage, cost, exemplar status, and expectations for 2030) and farm animal welfare (importance, definitions, and whether buying welfare-friendly products helps). They likely need concise question wording or a set of standardized survey questions capturing these topics.	A document is relevant to the query "welfare" when it substantively discusses welfare topics such as social welfare systems (coverage, cost, future outlook), animal welfare (farm animal protection, welfare-friendly products), or public attitudes and behaviors toward welfare policies. The pasted paragraph contains many survey items about national and community social welfare systems and questions about the importance of farm animal welfare and purchasing welfare‑friendly products, so those passages are clearly relevant. Documents that merely include the word "welfare" as a code fragment, in repeated metadata lines, or as a company/product name without substantive discussion are not relevant. Edge cases include narrowly focused documents — for example, a study only about consumer purchasing of welfare‑friendly products is highly relevant for animal‑welfare intent but less so for someone researching social welfare policy, and texts that use similar words (wellbeing, welfare check) may be ambiguous without context. To resolve ambiguity, prefer documents with full question text, explanatory context, or topic tags indicating "social policy" or "animal welfare."
67543	flüchtling	The user is looking for information about refugees ("Flüchtlinge") in Germany, particularly public attitudes and survey questions about integration, crime concerns, and whether refugees will be successfully integrated. They also want details on legal/status distinctions (refugee vs. Heimatvertriebener), political responses (e.g., CDU/CSU), and EU burden-sharing for migrants arriving in countries like Italy.	A document is relevant to the query "Flüchtling" if it substantively discusses refugees or displaced persons — for example news or analysis about refugees from North Africa arriving in Italy, EU rules on which country must take asylum seekers, German debates about integration, surveys asking “Wird es gelingen die Flüchtlinge bei uns…”, or questions about origin country, asylum policy, and crime perceptions. Short question texts, opinion-polls, legal texts about asylum responsibility, and reports on “Heimatvertriebene” (expellees/displaced persons) are also relevant because they address the same subject matter. Documents are non-relevant if they only contain the token “Flüchtling” as noise or duplication, are purely metadata or lists with no substantive content, or use similar words in a different sense (e.g., the adjective “flüchtig,” an animal fleeing, or a person’s surname). Edge cases include historical material on Heimatvertriebene (related but distinct from contemporary asylum issues), very short survey snippets or repeated keyword dumps (contain the term but offer little usable information), and documents in other languages — which can be relevant if they meaningfully discuss refugees but less useful if they lack context.
67689	family	Search for survey variables describing household and family characteristics—especially family income (country-specific measures and income quartiles), type of housing, and preferred gender roles/family type—across ISSP data for countries like Russia, Bulgaria and the Philippines. Also identify related variables on how you or a family member received clinical infection risk information (doctor, hospital staff, TV, internet, radio, brochures, NGOs, etc.).	A document is relevant to the keyword "family" when it explicitly concerns households or household members — for example, statements about family income (monthly income, income per family member, income quartiles), family type and roles (changing roles of husband and wife, which family model one prefers), or living arrangements described as "detached family house" or multi-family housing. Items that list survey questions or answers like "you or a member of your family received this information" or variables named RU_INC09 / BG_INC etc. are also highly relevant because they directly encode household-level information. A document is non-relevant when "family" appears only incidentally (e.g., in a company name, a biological "family" of viruses, or a single isolated token) or when only opaque technical codes are present without human-readable family content. Edge cases include records that mix relevant family labels with repetitive metadata or code lists: if readable labels or context (income amounts, role descriptions, housing types) are present the document should be considered relevant, but if it contains only numeric codes or duplicated lines with no explanatory text it may be borderline or require codebook lookup. Overall, the more distinct family-related fields and human-readable descriptions a document contains, the higher its relevance.
6854	natur	A concise survey information need: assess respondents’ beliefs about nature (e.g., whether “nature is sacred” and support for protecting the environment) and how important environmental goals are for societal development. Also map those answers to a coding scheme of political perception levels (01 ideologue through 09 no-issue-content, 99 not asked).	A document is relevant to the query "natur" when it explicitly addresses nature or environmental protection — for example texts that ask about "Schutz von Natur und Umwelt," survey items asking respondents to rate the importance of nature for societal development, or coding schemes that classify political attitudes toward environmental issues. Documents that include the survey scale, response options, or the listed variable codes (01–09) are especially pertinent because they show the content is about public attitudes and political perception of nature. Non-relevant documents merely containing the substring "natur" (e.g., in unrelated words like "international" or brand names) or using "natur" metaphorically without environmental meaning (e.g., "human nature" in a philosophical sense) should be deprioritized. Edge cases include texts in German versus English (German-language items such as "Schutz von Natur" are highly relevant), partial repeats or duplicated question blocks (which are relevant but signal redundancy), and documents that discuss economic or political decisions without any link to environmental consequences (which may be only tangentially relevant).
718	turkey	A search for survey questions and variable codes about public opinion in Turkey on EU accession — specifically whether people would favour Turkey joining the EU (once conditions are met), perceived obstacles (standards, democracy, human rights, economy, corruption, reconciliation, etc.), and related items like party attachment and regional identifiers. The query appears to target specific survey variables and datasets (ISSP/Eurobarometer, ZA/ v/Q codes) that record Turkish responses and regional breakdowns.	A document is relevant to the keyword "turkey" when it substantively discusses the country Turkey — for example public opinion about Turkey’s EU accession, survey items on favourability (QD15, Q37, Q58, etc.), party attachment in Turkey, or dataset notes (ISSP ZA4950/ZA7570) that report Turkish responses. Short lists of variable names or question codes that clearly refer to Turkish modules or to Turkey-specific questions are relevant because they signal content about Turkey’s membership prospects, reforms (human rights, democracy, standards), or regional treatment (Western Balkans and Turkey). A document is non-relevant when "turkey" refers to the bird, a recipe, a company name, or appears only incidentally (e.g., a long list of country names where Turkey is mentioned but not discussed), or when the main topic is unrelated despite containing a TR country code. Edge cases include texts that use alternative spellings (Türkiye), documents in another language that nevertheless focus on Turkey’s accession, or files that contain only raw dataset codes without question text — these may be borderline and should be judged by whether substantive Turkey-specific content (questions, responses, or analysis) is present.
729	trust	The user wants to measure how much trust people place in other nationalities (e.g., Russians, Americans, Luxembourgers, Belgians, British, Danes, Finns, Dutch, Spaniards, French, Greeks, Turks, Austrians) and in European institutions (European Parliament, Commission, Central Bank). They need a survey-style question asking respondents to indicate their level of trust on a four-point scale (a lot, some, not very much, no trust at all) and whether they tend to trust or tend not to trust those institutions/people.	A document is relevant to the query "trust" when it explicitly asks about or measures levels of trust — for example survey items that ask "How much trust do you have in the Russians/Americans?" or that list institutions like the European Parliament, European Commission, or European Central Bank and provide response options (a lot, some, not very much, none). Relevant examples include question codes and item text such as v25 Q7 TRUST IN RUSSIANS, qa10 1 EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT TRUST, or lists of trust-in-people items by nationality (British, Danes, Finns, etc.). Non-relevant documents are those that mention the word "trust" in unrelated senses (trust funds, legal trusts, idiomatic uses), or that only include a stray country name without any trust question or scale. Edge cases include noisy or duplicated transcripts where the core trust items are present among repeated text, translated or paraphrased surveys where the response scale is implicit, and documents that report aggregate “trust indices” (still relevant) versus documents that merely reference trustworthiness or reputation without measuring respondents’ trust (less relevant).
7422	psychische	Assess whether respondents were treated for a psychological or emotional problem in the past 12 months and capture repeated survey items about that treatment. Also determine whether respondents are exposed to work-related psychosocial stressors that negatively affect their wellbeing and whether their physical or mental health problems were caused or worsened by work (selecting the main reason where applicable).	A document is relevant if it contains the exact survey items or variable definitions asking whether someone was treated for a psychological or emotional problem in the last 12 months (e.g., W33201, x33201, y33201) or if it asks about exposure to work-related psychosocial stressors that negatively affect wellbeing (EF1050) or health problems caused or worsened by work in the past 12 months (EK0900P). Highly relevant examples are the full questionnaire or codebook showing the German question text, response options, timeframe (“letzten 12 Monate” / “vor der Berichtswoche”) and the variable codes. Non-relevant documents include general mental-health literature that does not ask about treatment or workplace causation, materials with a different timeframe (e.g., past 6 months), or unrelated occupational topics; simple metadata or summaries without the question wording are only partially useful. Edge cases include translations (English versions can be relevant if they clearly map back to the German items), items that mention “psychische Belastung” without linking to treatment or last-12-months timing (partially relevant), and duplicated strings of the same question (redundant but still relevant if content matches). Prefer sources that preserve both the exact wording and the variable/code context so you can unambiguously map responses to these survey items.
7445	psychische erkrankungen	User is looking for survey items and branching logic about mental health ("psychische Erkrankungen"), specifically questions on recent non‑chronic illness (were you sick in the last four weeks), whether the respondent received treatment for psychological problems in the past 12 months, exposure to work‑related psychosocial stressors that harm well‑being, and whether work caused or worsened physical or mental health. The query also requests the conditional display rules (Einblendung) that show these follow‑up questions when certain prior disease codes/fields (e.g., F095, hd01, hd13) are selected.	A document is relevant to the keyword "psychische erkrankungen" if it directly asks about or describes mental or psychological problems, their treatment, or work-related mental strain — for example the lines "Waren Sie während der letzten 12 Monate wegen eines psychischen oder seelischen Problems in Behandlung" and "Sind Sie bei Ihrer Arbeit psychisch belastenden Faktoren ausgesetzt" indicate clear relevance. The paragraph repeatedly asks about being sick in the last four weeks, treatment for psychological problems in the last 12 months, and whether work caused or worsened physical or mental health, so those items map tightly to the query. Edge cases include passages that only use generic terms like "Gesundheitsprobleme" or discuss chronic vs non-chronic illnesses without explicitly saying "psychisch" — these are borderline and may be partially relevant if context implies mental health. Non-relevant documents would focus exclusively on physical conditions, contain only administrative codes/variable names (hd16, V255) or routing logic without substantive mental-health content, or be in an unrelated language.
7488	psychische belastung	A concise summary of whether and how people experience psychological (seelische) burden — e.g., whether they received treatment for mental problems in the past 12 months, are exposed to work‑related psychological or physical stressors that harm their well‑being, and have health issues caused or worsened by work. It also covers related concerns about financial burdens (monthly loan payments, extra costs from health‑care reform) and who (young vs. old) will carry future financial strains.	A document is relevant to this query if it explicitly addresses "psychische Belastung" or equivalent survey items — for example, questions about being in treatment for a mental or emotional problem in the last 12 months, exposure to psychological stressors at work, or work-related health problems that are mental or psychosomatic in nature. Relevant documents also include survey instruments or reports that contain the exact question wording or variable codes (e.g., q033as, V199, V217) and analyses linking financial burdens (monthly interest/repayment) or policy changes (healthcare reform) to mental well‑being. Non‑relevant documents are those that mention “Belastung” only in a purely financial, legal, or physical context (e.g., mortgage interest or tax reform) without any connection to mental health, or texts that list variable names without corresponding question content. Borderline cases include papers on economic hardship or healthcare reform that discuss general burdens — these are relevant only if they explicitly analyze mental health outcomes or cite the same 12‑month / work‑related framing; translations, paraphrases, or duplicate survey copies that preserve the meaning should be treated as relevant.
79	environment	A concise description of survey items measuring public attitudes toward the environment, including personal willingness to protect it (e.g., paying higher prices or taxes, cutting standard of living), how important environmental protection is personally, perceived seriousness of various environmental problems (nuclear power, leaded fuel, industrial pollution, noise, etc.), opinions on public bodies’ effectiveness and preferred level of government involvement, and main sources of environmental information.	A document is relevant to the query "environment" if it explicitly addresses environmental topics such as attitudes toward protection, willingness to bear costs (taxes, higher prices, lower standard of living), perceived seriousness of specific problems (aircraft noise, industrial pollution, nuclear power), information sources about the environment, or levels of authority involvement. For example, survey items like "How willing to protect environment," "OVERALL IMPACT INDUSTRIAL AIR POLLUTION," and "Which are your three main sources of information about the environment" are clearly on-topic and indicate the document contains public-opinion or policy-related environmental content. Edge cases include items that only mention “environment” tangentially (e.g., a one-line reference in a broader economic report), brand names or metaphors using the word “environment,” or discussions of taxes that are unrelated to environmental protection; these would be less relevant. Also note that repeated labels, metadata, and year markers (1988, 1992) suggest a survey instrument or codebook—highly relevant for research into public attitudes but less so if the user seeks scientific measurements or ecological impact studies.
81	climate change	A request for who within the EU is seen as responsible for tackling climate change — i.e., which actors (national governments, the EU, regional/local authorities, businesses/industry, individuals, “all of them,” none, or others) people assign responsibility to. This likely reflects a survey question asking respondents to indicate which of those categories should tackle climate change.	This document is relevant because it explicitly contains repeated survey questions and coded responses about who within the EU is responsible for tackling climate change (answers including national governments, the European Union, businesses, regional/local authorities, individuals, “all of them,” “none,” and “don’t know”). A high-quality relevant document would provide clear, interpretable results or analysis (e.g., aggregated percentages, methodology, or commentary on public opinion across those categories). It would be less useful if it only contains raw, duplicated codes or transcription noise as here — still topically relevant but requiring cleaning and mapping of codes to meaningful labels. Edge cases include texts that mention “climate change” but discuss only scientific impacts (weather, ecosystems) without responsibility or policy, or documents about global responsibility frameworks that aren’t specific to the EU; those are partially relevant for context but not for the specific query about who within the EU is responsible.
8246	politisches engagement	The searcher wants to know whether political participation can achieve real change and how people view getting involved in politics—seeking public-opinion information on the effectiveness of engagement, support for specific state measures (e.g., taxation, job-creation), attitudes toward party directions and cooperation (CDU, SPD, Greens), EU development, and tolerance of political opponents.	A document is relevant to the keyword "politisches Engagement" when it explicitly addresses engagement in politics — for example questions or statements about whether people can achieve something through political engagement, descriptions of actions like voting, campaigning, joining parties, contacting representatives, protesting, or survey items asking about willingness to participate. The repeated survey item "GLAUBEN SIE DASS MAN DURCH ENGAGEMENT IN DER POLITIK ETWAS ERREICHEN KANN" is a clear positive signal, whereas lines about party positioning (e.g. "CDU politisch nach links entwickelt") are not relevant unless they are explicitly tied to mobilization or calls for participation. Watch out for false positives: phrases like "staatliches Engagement" (state intervention) or generic "Engagement" (volunteering for non-political causes) mention the word but do not concern civic/political participation. Edge cases include documents that only briefly mention engagement inside a long list of political items (partial relevance), or texts about political attitudes without any behavioral component (borderline relevant); relevance should be higher when the document contains concrete actions, efficacy evaluations, or repeated focused discussion of political engagement.
8382	politische werte	The user is looking for a summary of survey items measuring political values and engagement: which political actions people would take (e.g., voting, demonstrations, petitions, party work, traffic blockades), scales for willingness to act and perceived personal influence (e.g., 1–7 or 1–10), and general evaluations of political parties and government. They want a concise description of these questionnaire measures and response scales.	A document is relevant to the query "politische werte" if it addresses political values, attitudes or norms — for example survey items or scales that ask people to evaluate parties or the government, or that record willingness to take civic actions (voting, demonstrations, petitions, joining a party). The paragraph shown is clearly relevant: it lists response-coded items about political influence (V134–V144) and evaluative scales like "view government very bad — very good" and party ratings, which operationalize political values through attitudes and behavioral intentions. It would be non‑relevant if the text only uses the word "values" in an economic or appraisal sense, contains legal/administrative codes without attitudinal content, or is purely procedural (rules for protests) with no measure of personal or normative beliefs. Edge cases include questionnaire fragments that only show response scales or repeated instructions — these are borderline: they indicate a values survey (so relevant) but may lack enough context to interpret which political values are measured; similarly, translations or lists of variable codes without labels reduce usefulness. In short, prioritize documents that explicitly link opinions, norms or civic actions to evaluative scales or questions about the political system; exclude texts where "values" is unrelated or where only metadata appears.
8951	politische einstellungen	The user needs a survey question to capture respondents’ political orientation by self-placement on a left–right spectrum and to assess their attitudes toward people from various religious groups. They want concise question wording that asks respondents where they would place their own political views on a left–right scale and how they feel about different religious groups.	A document is relevant to the query "politische einstellungen" when it contains explicit material about political attitudes — for example German question wording or survey items that ask respondents to self-place on a left–right scale (terms like "links", "rechts", "Selbsteinstufung", "politische Einstellung"), scale labels or response options, and related attitudinal questions (such as feelings toward religious groups) that are used to measure political orientation. Concrete indicators of relevance include full question text, instructions for respondents, variable codes tied to survey items (e.g. pa01, po01, v54) and descriptions of the measurement instrument or coding scheme. A document is non-relevant if the words appear only as isolated metadata, repeated fragments with no substantive question text, unrelated uses of the same words (e.g. "politische" in a different topic), or if the content is corrupt/spammy and offers no usable survey content or conceptual discussion. Edge cases include codebooks or data dictionaries that only list variable names (which can be relevant if they link to question wording) and OCR'd/transcribed documents with heavy repetition — these may be borderline and require checking for the underlying question text or response categories to confirm relevance.
9035	politics	The user is looking for survey questions and measures about political parties and political engagement. Specifically they want items on whether parties are necessary, frequency of political discussion (in class/friends), political interest and participation, influence of politics on one's life, sources of political information, and preferences for the ideal party's characteristics.	This document is highly relevant to the keyword "politics" because it contains many survey questions and items explicitly about political parties, political discussion frequency, political interest/participation, and how politics influences respondents’ lives. For example, it asks respondents to rate whether parties are necessary on a 1–5 scale, whether parties encourage political activity, how often politics is discussed in class, and what an ideal party would look like. However, the text is noisy and repetitive (many duplicated lines, item codes like A3014/C3036, and a COUNTRY placeholder), which can create false positives in retrieval systems or make it less useful for users seeking polished analysis or news. It would be less relevant if the user wanted policy analysis, current events, or detailed country-specific information rather than raw survey instrument content or metadata.
9089	political trust	A survey-style query asking whether respondents tend to trust political parties (or not) and their level of trust in politicians. It also asks which sources of information about political matters they trust most (first and second choices) and which EU countries they consider politically trustworthy.	A document is relevant to the query "political trust" when it explicitly addresses trust in political actors, institutions, or information sources — for example items in the paragraph that ask whether people trust political parties or politicians, or which EU countries (Germany, UK, Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal) are seen as politically trustworthy. Survey instruments or results are especially relevant (QA5A/QA5B, Q57A, v211–v224 codes) because they show measured choices like experts, journalists, NGOs, bloggers, business leaders, friends/family, or “none/don’t know.” A document is non‑relevant if it contains only unrelated identifiers, boilerplate, or noise (repeated question text or stray variable codes) without substantive responses, or if it discusses “trust” solely in a non‑political context. Edge cases include options such as “NONE” or “OTHER SPONT” which are short but important survey responses that require interpretation, and overlapping categories (e.g. business leaders or NGOs) that may be tangentially political and need judgement to decide relevance.
9169	political interest	The user is looking for standard survey question wordings and response options used to measure individuals' interest in politics — for example, graded questions like "How interested would you say you are in politics?" or binary items like "Are you interested in politics? (Yes/No)," and variations distinguishing active participation from passive following. They want examples and phrasing used in surveys to classify respondents' political engagement.	A document is relevant to the query "political interest" when it explicitly measures or discusses people's interest in politics — for example survey question wording like "How interested would you say you are in politics?", "Are you interested in politics? 1 Yes 2 No", items contrasting active participation vs. passive following, response scales, or metadata that clearly links codes (v186, Q54, FR33) to those question texts. The repeated lines and question codes in the paragraph are relevant because they contain the exact phrasings and response options used to gauge political interest, and items about following foreign political problems or levels of interest are also on-topic. A document is non-relevant when it discusses unrelated meanings of "interest" (e.g., financial interest), addresses specific policies or actors without measuring personal political engagement, or consists only of isolated codes with no question wording. Edge cases include partial matches (mentions of "interest" without "politics" are not relevant), documents in other languages or abbreviated forms that nevertheless include the core question wording (still relevant), and noisy duplicates or repeated codes which are redundant but not disqualifying if the substantive question text is present.
9243	political efficacy	A search for "political efficacy" seeks a definition and ways it is measured — specifically an individual's belief they can understand and influence politics and that the political system will respond. Typical survey indicators include perceived influence of politics on one’s life, frequency of political discussion (class/friends), political interest and participation, beliefs about parties' role, and measures of political information or civic self‑efficacy.	A document is relevant to the keyword "political efficacy" when it directly measures people’s perceived ability to influence politics (internal efficacy) or their beliefs about the responsiveness of political institutions (external efficacy) — for example explicit labels like "SELBSTB Scale Self efficacy," items asking "How much is your life influenced by politics," or questions about whether people participate in politics or follow it with interest. In the paragraph above, entries such as "SELBSTB Scale Self efficacy," "Do you participate in political activities or do you follow politics with interest," and the item asking where you place yourself on whether parties are necessary are relevant because they tap perceived influence or capability. Content that focuses on party preferences or ideal party characteristics (repeated "WHAT WOULD THE IDEAL POLITICAL PARTY BE LIKE" pairs), metadata, variable codes, and repeated placeholders like "POLITICAL INFORMATION ITEM" without substantive wording are non‑relevant. Edge cases include political interest or participation questions, which may serve as useful correlates or proxies for efficacy but do not directly measure the belief "I can influence politics," and normative items such as "political parties encourage people to become active" which reflect beliefs about others rather than self‑efficacy. Prefer documents with explicit efficacy wording, scale response options, or items about personal influence or system responsiveness; deprioritize administrative text, party ideology items, and unlabeled information placeholders.
974	psychische gesundheit	The user is looking for survey-style information on mental (psychological) health—specifically measures and questions about recent treatment for psychological problems, exposure to work-related psychological stressors, work-caused or -worsened health issues, and self-rated overall health and perceived health risks (e.g., from COVID-19 or BSE).	A document is relevant to the keyword "psychische gesundheit" if it explicitly addresses mental or psychological health (German terms like psychisch, seelisch, psychische Gesundheit), mental-health treatment, psychiatric care, self-rated mental wellbeing, or psychosocial stressors (for example, "Waren Sie während der letzten 12 Monate wegen eines psychischen oder seelischen Problems in Behandlung" or "Sind Sie bei Ihrer Arbeit psychisch belastenden Faktoren ausgesetzt"). Items asking whether work caused or worsened physical or psychological problems are also highly relevant because they link occupational exposures to mental health outcomes. Documents that focus only on general physical health, infectious disease risk perceptions (BSE, Coronavirus) or on metadata/codes without substantive mental-health content are not relevant unless they explicitly discuss psychological impacts (e.g., anxiety about COVID-19). Edge cases include ambiguous questions like "Gesundheitszustand" with no mental/physical qualifier (partially relevant depending on context), mentions of "psychisch" in non-clinical idioms, or long multi-topic surveys where mental-health items are present but rare — these should be scored as partially relevant unless mental-health content is prominent. Finally, repeated or duplicated lines (codes or verbatim repeats) do not increase relevance beyond the substantive mental-health items they contain.
12195	persönlichkeitsmerkmale	The user wants a clear overview of personality traits and how to evaluate their own characteristics. They are looking for definitions of common traits (e.g., the Big Five) and simple guidance or items to self-assess where they see themselves.	The query "persönlichkeitsmerkmale" seeks information about personality traits, so a document that helps someone identify or describe typical traits is relevant. The provided paragraph is in German and repeatedly prompts the reader to "assess yourself," which is directly related to eliciting information about personality and therefore partially relevant. However, it is low-quality for this query because it contains no specific trait names (for example, introversion, conscientiousness, openness), no definitions, scoring, or examples, and is cluttered with repeated lines and "br" artifacts. A fully relevant document would include trait lists or models (Big Five), behavioral indicators, example items or scoring guidance, whereas this text might only be useful as a brief survey prompt or starting instruction but not as substantive information. Edge cases: it could be acceptable if the user wanted a short questionnaire header, but it is non-relevant if the user expects definitions, research, or concrete trait descriptions.
14255	konsum	The user is looking for measures and survey questions about consumption and media use, including frequency of reading local, regional and national newspapers (and specific titles), watching news on public or private TV, and membership/knowledge of consumer associations and their magazines. They also want questions about personal consumption habits (wine, meat, various foods and drinks) and smoking frequency.	A document is relevant for the query "konsum" when it directly addresses consumption behavior or consumer topics — for example survey items asking how often people read local or national newspapers, whether they drink wine, eat meat, or smoke, or questions about consumer associations and magazines. The paragraph you provided contains many clearly relevant elements: frequency-of-use questions (e.g., "An wievielen Tagen … gelesen"), dietary frequency lists ("Essen Sie Fleisch", repeated item lists), and explicit consumer‑association prompts, all of which are central to consumption research. Documents that are non‑relevant mention "Konsum" only tangentially (e.g., as part of a company name or filename), discuss production/supply issues rather than end‑user consumption, or contain only survey metadata and response codes (KA, TNZ, wave notes) without behavioral content. Edge cases include ambiguous intent (if the user meant economic consumption vs. media/food consumption), documents that only include a single occurrence of the term in a header, or materials in a different language — these may be borderline relevant depending on whether the user needs raw survey items, coded data, or high‑level analysis. Prioritize texts with explicit frequency measures, question wording, or lists of consumer goods when matching for "konsum."
15640	karriere	The query "karriere" (German for "career") indicates a need for information about building or advancing a professional life—such as career paths, job opportunities, required qualifications and skills, CV/interview advice, or company career pages. The user likely wants guidance on starting, changing, or progressing a career and finding relevant openings.	A document is relevant to the keyword "karriere" if it clearly focuses on careers, career development, job opportunities, CV/interview advice, or pathways within professions — for example, a German-language guide to switching careers, a company’s careers page, or a list of job openings. Because "karriere" is German, pages written in German or aimed at German-speaking jobseekers are usually more relevant; English pages about "career" can still be useful but may not match the user’s language intent. Non-relevant documents merely mentioning the word in passing, using it as a surname or brand name, or containing it only in unrelated lists are not helpful. Edge cases include pages where the term appears only inside large aggregated content (e.g., a long forum thread) or outdated job postings that no longer apply; these may require extra weighting or freshness checks. Signals that increase relevance include the term appearing in titles, headings, meta tags, structured job data, and in-depth, actionable content; weak signals are single occurrences, poor translations, or pages that focus on adjacent topics like general business news without career-specific information.
1743	lebenszufriedenheit	The user is looking for a clear explanation of a German survey item about "Lebenszufriedenheit" — a single-item measure asking respondents to rate their overall life satisfaction on a 1–7 scale, introduced by two contrasting self-evaluation vignettes. They likely want to understand the question’s purpose, wording and how to administer or interpret responses in a survey or research context.	A document is relevant to the keyword "lebenszufriedenheit" when it directly addresses life satisfaction as a self-evaluation — for example the dialog between two friends about how satisfied they feel and the repeated 1–7 satisfaction question in this paragraph — or when it presents measurement items, Likert scales, or survey modes (CAWI, MAIL) used to assess life satisfaction. Content that discusses subjective well‑being, life satisfaction scales (e.g., explicit 1 = very unsatisfied to 7 = very satisfied), or translations of those questions into other languages is also highly relevant because it bears on how lebenszufriedenheit is operationalized and measured. A document is not relevant if it only uses the word "Leben" in other contexts (life insurance, biological life) or treats happiness abstractly without linking to personal satisfaction or self‑report measurement; a single offhand mention of "Lebenszufriedenheit" in a bibliography can be a weak match. Edge cases include materials that duplicate questionnaire items many times (noise but still relevant), methodological papers on survey administration (relevant if they concern measurement of life satisfaction, but only tangentially if they focus solely on sampling or statistics), and texts that use close synonyms (subjective well‑being, life quality) which should be considered relevant depending on whether they cover self‑rated satisfaction.
1817	mediennutzung	The user wants to assess an individual's media usage and preferences, specifically how often they watch TV and read a daily newspaper and how much they like different music genres. They also want ratings of interest in various types of TV programs using a scale from "very much" to "not at all."	A document is relevant to the query "mediennutzung" if it directly addresses individuals' media consumption patterns — for example survey items asking how many days per week someone watches TV, how often they read a newspaper, or how much they like different music genres. Questionnaire text, lists of media types, and response scales (very strong/strong/medium/low/not at all) are strong indicators of relevance; even if the material is in German or contains repeated or slightly garbled lines, it still maps to media-use measurement. A document is non-relevant when it discusses media in other senses (media production, technical specs, advertising strategy) or treats “media” only tangentially without measuring usage behaviors. Edge cases include documents that only cover one medium (e.g., music preference but not TV/newspapers) — still relevant but narrower in scope — and methodological or theoretical papers about media effects that do not contain concrete usage questions, which may be borderline. Relevance is highest when the text contains explicit frequency measures, question wording, or Likert-style interest ratings that could be used to quantify media use.
18589	migranten	A need to find or reproduce a survey measuring German public attitudes toward migrants, including items on contact with foreigners, perceived treatment and discrimination, integration (e.g., whether migrants can become “real” Germans), support for Islam instruction in schools, estimates of foreigner share, neighborhood preferences, and views on refugees’ risks or opportunities. The user is looking for the specific questionnaire items and response scales used to assess these attitudes.	A document is relevant to the keyword "migranten" when its main subject is migration or migrants — for example discussions of foreigners or refugees in Germany, public-opinion surveys about "in Deutschland lebende Ausländer", policies on integration or schooling (e.g., Islamunterricht), neighborhood preferences, or measured attitudes and discrimination scales. Concrete signals of relevance include mentions of synonyms like Ausländer, Flüchtlinge, Einwanderer/Zuwanderer, statistics on foreigner percentages, survey items asking about contact with migrants, or instruments showing Likert/scale responses about migrants. A document is non-relevant when the word appears only incidentally or in a different domain — for example IT/database migration, animal migration studies, or a passing quote that doesn’t address people, policy, or public attitudes. Edge cases include German-language materials (which are highly relevant if they discuss migrants), documents that discuss legal status vs cultural assimilation (both can be relevant but for different analytic needs), and methodological survey texts: questionnaires and scale descriptions are relevant even though they are not interpretive analyses. If a text only reports raw demographic counts (e.g., census tables) it is borderline but usually relevant; if it uses "migration" in a metaphorical or technical sense unrelated to human migration, it is not relevant.
19136	migra	A survey variable capturing both respondents' migration status (East/West resident, commuter, or migrant) and their attitudes about migration related to EU enlargement. It asks whether people expect significant or limited migration from Eastern and Central Europe to the respondent’s country, whether that is positive or negative (and why), plus agree/disagree responses to statements about immigration and immigrants.	A document is relevant to the keyword "migra" when it discusses human migration, migrants, or migration-related survey variables—for example, the paragraph’s variable codes (1 = purely West, 3 = West migrant to the East) and the EU-enlargement questions about people moving from Eastern and Central Europe clearly match the intent. Relevant examples include survey documentation, questionnaire text about immigration attitudes, or analyses of East–West migration flows. Non-relevant documents merely containing the substring "migra" but about other topics—e.g., "migraine," "migratory birds," or an unrelated acronym "MIGRA"—should be excluded. Edge cases include short or ambiguous mentions (a lone variable name "migra" without context), foreign-language uses or slang ("la migra" referring to immigration enforcement), and documents that list variable codes but lack substantive migration content; for those, check surrounding words like "migration," "migrants," "EU enlargement," "East," "West," or "survey" to confirm relevance.
21585	linksrechtsskala	The user wants a clear explanation of the "left–right scale" used in political surveys — what it measures and how respondents, parties and politicians are asked to place themselves. They also need to know common implementations and coding (e.g., 0–10, 1–11 or 1–5 "thermometer" formats), plus how missing/"don't know" responses and wave-specific variations are handled.	A document is relevant if it contains survey questions, codebooks, or questionnaires that ask respondents to place themselves, parties, or politicians on a left–right political scale (e.g., self-placement items, party placement such as SPD/CDU/FDP/CSU/Greens, or politician ratings like Helmut Kohl or Oskar Lafontaine). Relevant documents typically show the exact scale format and wording (examples: 1–11 scales, 0–10 thermometers, 1–5 follow‑up thermometers, or two‑step left/middle/right plus intensity), response codes (e.g. 01..11, 98/99/00, KA/no answer) and variable labels (F35, F30, F31, FIV31, etc.) or wave-specific instructions. Non‑relevant texts are those that use the words “links” or “rechts” in other senses (hyperlinks, legal “rechts,” spatial directions) or general political commentary that does not include a measurement instrument or scale item. Edge cases include documents that merely mention left–right ideology without showing the response categories (lower relevance), translations or summaries of questionnaires (may be partially relevant), and telephone‑survey notes that omit visual thermometers or change coding across waves — these require careful inspection to confirm they capture the scale information sought.
21895	linksrechts	Survey items asking respondents to place their own political views on a left–right scale (using lettered boxes or a 0–10 "thermometer") and to rate where various political parties fall on that same scale. It also asks respondents to assess how strong they perceive conflicts or interest differences to be between various social and political groups in Germany.	Relevant documents are those that clearly function as a political questionnaire or survey instrument using the German left/right framing—e.g., items that ask respondents to place themselves on a left–right scale, to rate parties on that same scale, or to rate group conflicts (the text’s repeated “links” and “rechts,” scale descriptors like 0–10, answer boxes/letters, and mode labels like CAWI/MAIL are strong signals). Include full question wording, response options, and instructions (such as “make a cross” or “name the letter below”) because these show the document’s purpose and allow mapping to the query. Non-relevant documents mention “left” and “right” in other senses (driving directions, anatomical terms, or web “links”), are opinion pieces that only refer to left/right metaphorically, or are fragments that lack any survey structure or scale. Edge cases include transcripts or reports that quote the questionnaire (still relevant) and heavily duplicated or HTML-tagged copies (the repeated br tags or repeats are noisy but still relevant if the survey content is present).
22951	medienkonsum	The user wants an overview of "Medienkonsum" — how people use different media for entertainment and information, including types of media, usage patterns, effects, and practical guidance or recommendations for healthy media habits.	A document is relevant to the keyword "medienkonsum" if it discusses how people consume media — types of media (TV, internet, social media, radio), usage patterns, time spent, demographic differences, or effects of media on users. The supplied paragraph — repeatedly mentioning "the various means of entertainment and information" — is semantically related and could be relevant even though it does not explicitly use the word "medienkonsum"; however, the repeated lines and HTML-like breaks suggest low quality or noisy duplication. Non-relevant documents simply name media channels without addressing consumption (for example a technical spec for broadcasting equipment, site navigation menus, or marketing copy), or focus on media production/policy rather than user behavior. Edge cases include translated text or synonyms (e.g., "media use" or "usage patterns") which should be treated as relevant, whereas boilerplate repetitions, spam, or isolated phrases with no substantive content should be treated as non-relevant.
230	umweltbewusstsein	The user wants a clear definition and overview of "umweltbewusstsein" (environmental awareness), including its significance for individuals and society. They may also be seeking examples, ways to foster eco-conscious behavior, and methods to measure or promote it.	A document is relevant to the keyword "umweltbewusstsein" if it explicitly discusses environmental awareness — for example definitions, surveys or statistics on public attitudes, educational programs, behavioral studies (recycling, low-carbon transport), awareness-raising campaigns, or policy measures intended to increase ecological consciousness, especially in German-language or Germany-focused contexts. Highly relevant documents include NGO reports on German citizens’ environmental attitudes, academic papers measuring "Umweltbewusstsein," school curricula on sustainability, and case studies of successful awareness campaigns. Documents are non-relevant if they merely mention the word in passing, use it as marketing jargon without evidence (e.g., a product labeled "umweltbewusst" with no substantiation), or if the text is about unrelated topics that happen to contain the word (company names, trademarks, or literal biological uses of "Umwelt" in ethology that do not address human environmental attitudes). Edge cases include English-language materials using the synonym "environmental awareness" (relevant if the user intends the same concept), articles reporting environmental outcomes (like emissions or recycling rates) that imply awareness without naming it (potentially relevant), and philosophical or scientific uses of "Umwelt" that require checking intent before deeming them relevant.
26823	technology	Someone searching for "technology" here is likely looking for survey items or a way to measure public interest, awareness, and attitudes toward technology. They want to assess things like personal interest and informedness about science and tech, perceived regional leadership in ICT use, expected impacts of emerging technologies over the next 20 years, information sources, and the future role of space-derived technologies.	This document is relevant to the query "technology" because it repeatedly names technology-related topics (e.g., "A5 Technology," "science and technology," "information and communication technologies," "Internet," "mobile telephone," and "space derived technologies") and contains question items about interest, awareness, and perceived effects of new technologies. It is specifically a survey questionnaire, so it is especially useful if the query intent is about public attitudes, survey design, questionnaire items, or measuring interest in technology (for example, researchers looking for response scales like "1 Not at all" to "4 Very much"). It would be non-relevant for intents seeking technical explanations, implementation details, code, or product specifications — this text contains no technical descriptions or how-to guidance. Edge cases: noisy formatting and repeated prompt tokens (FW2, Present list, duplicated lines) may lower precision in retrieval but could help if the user wants examples of survey wording or repeated-item validation.
2817	populismus	The user wants a clear, concise definition of "populism" and its distinguishing characteristics. They may also be looking for the different types (left/right), typical causes and rhetoric, and examples or political consequences to understand how the concept applies in practice.	A document is relevant to the keyword "populismus" if it explicitly defines or analyzes populism—its core features (anti-elitism, people-versus-elite rhetoric, charismatic leadership, simplistic policy promises), its varieties (right-wing, left-wing, nativist), or concrete case studies (e.g., analyses of parties or leaders in Germany, Austria, the US, or Latin America). Empirical research, historical overviews, comparative studies, media- and discourse-analyses, and articles that measure or operationalize populism (indices, survey evidence, rhetorical coding) are highly relevant because they provide substantive explanation and examples. A document that merely mentions the word in passing, uses it as a political insult without conceptual clarity, or discusses unrelated topics that happen to contain the substring "populismus" is not relevant. Edge cases include opinion pieces or satire that use populismus rhetorically (partly relevant if they illuminate public perception), documents in other languages where the concept is analyzed under different labels, and news reports about protests or policies that imply populist dynamics but do not explicate them (these are partially relevant depending on depth).
28676	worklife	A user searching "worklife" wants to assess how their job responsibilities affect their personal life, specifically measuring how often work duties interfere with private life (often/sometimes/rarely/never). This is part of a broader survey about impressions of everyday places and people.	A document is relevant to the keyword "worklife" when it explicitly addresses the relationship between work and private life — for example discussions of where people work, how job tasks or duties affect home life, commuting, working hours, or questions about work–life balance. The provided paragraph is highly relevant because it mentions "wo Sie ... arbeiten" (where you work) and directly asks how frequently professional duties impair private life, which ties squarely to worklife issues. A document is non-relevant if it only lists everyday locations or gives general survey instructions and Likert scales without any linkage to employment, job demands, or effects on personal life. Edge cases include texts that use the word "work" in other senses (e.g., "work of art," mechanical "working" devices), brief passing mentions of employment status without discussing impacts on private life, or multilingual repetitions and boilerplate that dilute the substantive work–life content.
317	homeoffice	Seeks information and viewpoints about the debate on whether employees should have a legal right to work from home when the job allows it. Also asks whether and how it would be feasible for the respondent’s specific role to perform part of their work remotely.	A document is relevant to the keyword "homeoffice" when it directly discusses working from home — for example debates about a legal right to telework, employer policies, surveys asking whether jobs can be performed remotely, technical or occupational constraints, or case studies of hybrid work arrangements. Relevant examples include draft legislation on a statutory right to work from home, company telecommuting rules, employee questionnaires asking "Wäre es bei Ihrer Tätigkeit möglich, einen Teil der Arbeit von zuhause zu erledigen?", and analyses of which job tasks can or cannot be done remotely. Non-relevant documents mention "home office" only incidentally (e.g., ads for home office furniture, interior design posts), use the term in a different sense (the UK Home Office government department or a brand named HomeOffice), or discuss COVID-19 broadly without addressing entitlement, feasibility, or implementation. Edge cases include multilingual or poorly parsed texts where "br" or line breaks split survey questions, documents that only touch on remote work peripherally (partially relevant), and materials focused on technical infrastructure or occupational safety that are relevant only if they tie back to the question of allowing work from home.
32087	sexualität	The user wants to know how the disclosure of Thomas Hitzlsperger’s homosexuality relates to active professional footballers, specifically asking about public and professional acceptance — would an active pro who is openly gay be supported, hired, or face discrimination.	A document is relevant to the query "sexualität" when it directly addresses sexual orientation, coming-out experiences, public discussions of sexuality (especially in sports), or policies and social attitudes toward LGBTQ+ athletes. For example, a news article about Thomas Hitzlsperger coming out, interviews with active professional footballers about being gay, club anti-discrimination policies, or surveys of fan reactions would be clearly relevant. Documents that focus narrowly on biological reproduction, clinical sexual health without linking to orientation, erotica, or unrelated uses of the word are not relevant. Borderline cases include historical treatments of sexuality in sport, language-other-than-German sources, and speculative gossip that attempts to out an active player — these may touch the topic but raise privacy and reliability concerns. Prefer authoritative, respectful sources that discuss acceptance, policy, or concrete examples of active athletes coming out; avoid materials that invade privacy or rely on rumors.
32820	selbstdarstellung	The user is looking for a short written self-presentation ("Selbstdarstellung")—either a ready-made paragraph or guidance on how to write one—to introduce themselves for applications, profiles, or introductions. They need concise advice or an example that covers background, strengths, and goals in an appropriate tone and structure.	A document is relevant to the keyword "selbstdarstellung" when it centrally discusses self‑presentation—definitions, theories from psychology or communication studies, practical tips for crafting a personal profile (e.g., CV, LinkedIn, artist statement), or concrete examples of how people present themselves online and offline. Useful signals are the term appearing in headings, abstracts, or the first paragraphs, detailed case studies or templates, and comparisons to related concepts like "Selbstmarketing" or "Impression Management." A document is non‑relevant if the word appears only once in passing, if the page is primarily about an unrelated topic (for example a product named “Selbstdarstellung” with no explanatory content), or if the content is purely visual with no textual explanation. Edge cases include materials in other languages using the translation "self‑presentation" (which may still be relevant), academic papers that mention the term only in literature review, and artistic discussions where "Selbstdarstellung" refers specifically to genre conventions rather than practical self‑marketing—these may be relevant depending on whether the user seeks theoretical, practical, or creative perspectives.
33259	selbstwirksamkeit	The user is looking for a clear definition and explanation of "Selbstwirksamkeit" (self-efficacy), including its psychological role in motivation and behavior change, how it’s measured, and practical ways to strengthen it.	A document is relevant to the keyword "selbstwirksamkeit" if it directly discusses the concept of self‑efficacy — for example defining Bandura’s theory, describing measurement tools like the General Self‑Efficacy Scale, reporting interventions to boost self‑efficacy in education, health or workplace settings, or giving concrete examples of self‑efficacy change. Relevant documents often include empirical studies, literature reviews, clinical or educational guides, and translated texts that explicitly equate "selbstwirksamkeit" with "self‑efficacy." Non‑relevant documents merely containing the word in a list or passing mention, focusing on different constructs (e.g., self‑esteem, confidence) without addressing efficacy beliefs, or using the term in an unrelated technical or legal sense should be treated as low relevance. Edge cases include German vs. English materials (a paper using only the English term "self‑efficacy" is still relevant), compound or inflected forms (selbstwirksamkeitserfahrung, selbstwirksamkeitsüberzeugung), and domain‑specific uses where a paper may be relevant only to a particular context (e.g., academic self‑efficacy) rather than to general theory. Assess relevance by checking whether the document provides conceptual explanation, empirical evidence, measurement details, or practical guidance about self‑efficacy rather than a brief or tangential mention.
33371	selbstverwirklichung	The user wants to assess how important self-fulfillment/self-actualization (selbstverwirklichung) is to a person when considering their life goals, using a 1–7 importance scale. They need clear instructions or a concise definition so respondents can reliably rate the personal importance of self-realization.	A document is relevant to the keyword "selbstverwirklichung" if it explicitly addresses self-realization or closely related ideas such as personal goals, life aspirations, value priorities, or measures of psychological growth. The supplied paragraph is relevant because it directly asks respondents to reflect on "what you actually strive for in your life" and to rate the importance of those items on a 1–7 scale, which is a survey approach to assessing self-fulfillment. Other clearly relevant examples include psychological discussions (e.g., Maslow’s self-actualization), interviews or personal essays about achieving one’s potential, and validated scales or survey items that operationalize self-realization. Non-relevant documents are those that only mention the term in passing, use it as a brand or headline unrelated to meaning, or cover unrelated topics (technical manuals, recipes, legal notices); boilerplate survey templates that never list substantive life-goals are borderline relevant but less useful than items that actually probe specific aspirations. Edge cases include translations or metaphorical uses where the term appears but the content does not explore personal striving, which should be judged less relevant unless context shows a thematic focus on self-realization.
34932	rightwing	The user wants a concise paragraph defining "rightwing" — a political label for conservative or reactionary positions that typically favor limited government, free-market economics, traditional social and cultural values, strong national defense, and law-and-order policies. They likely expect a clear summary of core beliefs and how right-wing views contrast with left-wing positions.	A document is relevant to the keyword "rightwing" if its primary focus is on right-wing politics or ideology—discussing conservative, nationalist, libertarian, or far‑right movements, party platforms, typical policy positions (e.g., immigration restriction, free‑market advocacy), historical development, or profiles of right‑wing leaders and organizations. Useful examples include analyses of a country's right‑wing party, academic papers comparing right‑wing policy trends, news reports about right‑wing rallies, or datasets showing voting patterns among right‑wing constituencies. Non‑relevant documents treat the term in a different sense (e.g., describing the right wing of a building or aircraft), use it only in passing without substantive content, are spam, or contain unrelated homographs or usernames that happen to include the word. Edge cases include phrases like "the right wing of the party" (which may be relevant if it discusses intra‑party ideology), differences in what counts as right‑wing across countries, and pieces that merely quote right‑wing rhetoric without analysis—these can be borderline relevant depending on depth and intent.
39506	sozialisation	A request to report, on a given scale, how much religious education influenced one’s upbringing in the parental home — i.e., to quantify the role of religious socialization by the family. This information is needed to assess the strength of familial socialization in shaping religious values and practices.	A document is relevant to the keyword "sozialisation" if it explicitly addresses processes of socialization—especially family-centered topics such as how parental upbringing and religious education shaped a person—like the survey prompt "Bitte sagen Sie mir anhand dieser Skala jetzt welche Rolle in Ihrem Elternhaus die religiöse Erziehung gespielt hat." Relevant examples include questionnaire items, interview transcripts about parental influence, sociological studies of religious socialization, and codebooks reporting Likert-scale answers. Non-relevant documents include uses of similar words in other senses (e.g., workplace onboarding, animal socialization), pages that only contain the keyword without substantive content, or completely unrelated topics such as product descriptions or news articles. Edge cases include texts that mention "religiöse Erziehung" but treat it theologically rather than as a socialization process, translations or survey templates that include the phrase but lack empirical data, and documents with HTML artifacts (like "br" or "Answer:") that signal a scraped or partially formatted questionnaire—these may be partially relevant depending on whether they preserve the socialization context.
4027	migrationshintergrund	The user wants a clear definition and explanation of the German term "Migrationshintergrund" — who is counted as having a migration background, how the term is used in official statistics, forms, and law, and what social or administrative implications it carries. They may also be seeking criteria, examples, or guidance on how to report this status on documents.	A document is relevant to the keyword "migrationshintergrund" if it treats that term as the demographic or legal concept used in German-speaking contexts — for example studies, reports or policies that analyze people "mit Migrationshintergrund" or provide census and school statistics by migration background. Relevant examples include government or NGO reports on integration, academic articles about educational outcomes by migration background, public-health research stratified by Migrationshintergrund, and policy briefs on anti-discrimination measures. Documents are non-relevant when the word appears only incidentally or in an unrelated sense, such as software/database migration logs, travelogues, genealogical migration histories, or when it is merely part of a filename or metadata with no substantive discussion. Edge cases include texts in other languages that discuss the same concept (those are relevant if they clearly map to the German category), short tables that list counts without explanation (borderline relevance), and personal anecdotes about individual immigrants (relevant only if they connect to the broader category or analysis).
43698	covid19	A user querying "covid19" is seeking basic and up-to-date information about the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2—its symptoms, transmission, testing, treatment, vaccines, and prevention measures. They may also want current case trends, variant information, and relevant public‑health or travel guidance.A document is relevant to the keyword "covid19" if it directly addresses SARS‑CoV‑2 or the COVID‑19 pandemic — for example discussions of symptoms, transmission, testing, vaccines, treatments, public‑health guidance, case counts, or variant surveillance. Highly relevant examples include CDC or WHO guidance, peer‑reviewed studies on vaccine efficacy, official local restriction updates, and datasets of confirmed cases; by contrast, social media rumors, opinion pieces without evidence, or documents that merely mention COVID‑19 in passing are less relevant. Non‑relevant documents include unrelated materials that include the string "covid19" in a filename, references, or metadata but whose main topic is different, or content about other respiratory diseases without clear connection to SARS‑CoV‑2. Edge cases depend on user intent and timeliness: early‑pandemic guidance may be historically relevant but clinically outdated, and modeling or preprint studies may be important for research queries yet unsuitable for medical advice. Finally, relevance also depends on synonyms and language (e.g., "coronavirus," "SARS‑CoV‑2") and source credibility — authoritative, recent sources should be prioritized for health or policy queries.
5030	sicherheitsgefühl	A search for "sicherheitsgefühl" seeks a clear explanation of the subjective sense of safety—what it means, how it differs from objective risk, and the personal, social, and environmental factors that shape it. The user may also want ways to measure or strengthen that feeling and to understand its effects on behaviour and well‑being.	A document is relevant to the keyword "sicherheitsgefühl" when it explicitly discusses the subjective feeling or perception of safety—for example studies, interviews, surveys, or policy analyses about how people feel in their homes, neighborhoods, workplaces, or on public transport. Relevant material can include research on psychological factors, environmental design (lighting, visibility, urban planning), community measures (neighbourhood watches, policing strategies) or evaluations of interventions that aim to improve perceived safety. Documents that only report objective crime statistics without linking them to residents' perceptions, or that treat "Sicherheit" solely as technical or legal security (e.g., cybersecurity protocols or safety regulations) are generally not relevant unless they address the emotional or perceptual dimension. Edge cases include articles about physical security measures (CCTV, locks) which are relevant if they explore their impact on people’s sense of security, and translated or synonym-using texts (e.g., "sense of safety") which are relevant if the connection to subjective perception is clear. Non-relevant items can also be brand names, product pages, or incidental mentions where the term appears but the document does not examine feelings of safety.
50581	digitalisierung	The user wants a concise paragraph that defines "Digitalisierung" (digitalization) and summarizes its significance, main effects, and typical applications (e.g., in business, public services, and daily life). They likely need a clear, ready-to-use text for an essay, report, or presentation.A document is relevant to the keyword "digitalisierung" if it directly addresses digitalization as a process—covering strategies, technologies, policy, case studies, implementation steps, or measurable outcomes (for example, papers on e‑government rollout, Industry 4.0 adoption, cloud migrations, or workforce digital‑skill programs). Relevant texts typically use related terminology (IoT, AI, digital transformation, digitization strategy), give concrete examples or metrics, and explain challenges and solutions. Non‑relevant documents merely mention the word in passing, use it in an unrelated sense (e.g., simple file scanning labeled “digitization”), are generic marketing spam, or focus on tangential topics without substantive discussion. Edge cases include language/term differences (German "Digitalisierung" vs English "digitization"), sector‑specific reports that may be relevant only to particular industries, and older sources whose guidance may be outdated; a brief mention or a translated hit may be useful depending on user intent but often isn’t sufficient. Signals of high relevance are in‑depth coverage, clear methods or case studies, up‑to‑date dates, and matching language/region.
5065	sicherheitsempfinden	The user wants to describe or assess their personal sense of safety ("Sicherheitsempfinden") in public places—whether they generally feel safe or unsafe. They may also be seeking to identify circumstances or factors (time, location, crowding, lighting, etc.) that influence that feeling.	A document is relevant if it focuses on people's subjective sense of safety in public places, for example survey questions or interview responses asking “Do you generally feel safe at public places?” or analyses of how perceptions vary by time of day, lighting, crowding, police presence, gender or age. Useful documents will describe measurement methods (Likert-scale questions, open-ended personal accounts, neighborhood safety indexes) or give concrete examples like “I don’t feel safe in poorly lit parks at night.” Non-relevant documents discuss unrelated kinds of security (cybersecurity, physical locks, workplace health-and-safety rules) or only present raw crime statistics without linking them to perceived safety. Edge cases include materials that use only the word “Sicherheit” (safety) without addressing “empfinden” (feeling) — these may be partially relevant if they discuss public safety conditions — and short or truncated German phrases; texts in German that mirror the question are especially pertinent, while translations and broader mental-health discussions are relevant only when tied to feeling safe in public spaces.
52781	alkoholkonsum	The user is looking for survey question wording and response categories to measure alcohol consumption frequency (e.g., past 12 months and past month), including typical answer ranges like "never", numeric frequency bands (1–5, 6–11, etc.), weekly/monthly/daily categories, and associated skip/branching instructions.	A document is relevant to the keyword "alkoholkonsum" if it contains questionnaire items or response categories that measure alcohol consumption frequency or recency (e.g., “How often have you drunk alcohol in the last year/month/last 12 months”), including the specific response scales (Never; 1–5 times; approximately once a month; 1–2 times, 3–5 times, …, more than 20 times). Concrete indicators of relevance include survey instructions and skip logic tied to consumption codes (for example “if code 13 continue with 55” or “if yes to monthly code 4 continue with 13b”), labels like FW2/F13/F62, and atypical response options such as “yes but only one gulp.” Partial matches (frequency mentioned without a clear timeframe, or general references to drinking behavior) are somewhat relevant but weaker, while documents that discuss alcohol-related diagnoses, policy, or biomarkers without frequency questions are only tangentially relevant. Non-relevant documents are those focusing on other substances, unrelated health topics, or purely administrative text with no consumption items. Edge cases to watch for include linguistic variations (“consumed,” “had a drink,” German phrasing), duplicate or slightly different scales across forms, and very low-frequency categories that may be coded differently across surveys.
53827	berufsabschluss	The user needs to understand or answer whether they hold a "Berufsabschluss" — i.e., a completed vocational training qualification or an academic degree — typically to complete a form or verify eligibility for a job, benefit, or application.	A document is highly relevant to the keyword "berufsabschluss" if it explicitly asks about or describes a completed vocational qualification or academic degree — for example a job application form, CV, certificate recognition form, or guidance on proving a completed apprenticeship or study program. The repeated question "Haben Sie eine abgeschlossene Berufsausbildung oder ein abgeschlossenes Studium" in the paragraph is a direct match and signals a questionnaire or form field, so such a document would be judged very relevant. Borderline or partial relevance occurs when synonyms or variants are used (Ausbildung, Abschluss, Qualifikation) or when the text discusses having no Berufsabschluss ("ohne Berufsabschluss"); these are still pertinent but may require stemming or semantic matching. Non-relevant documents mention similar words in different senses (e.g., a general "Abschluss" meaning a thesis defense, content about ending a career, or OCR/misspellings like "berufsabsschluss") or only contain the term incidentally without substantive information about vocational credentials.
54808	berufsprestige	The user wants a concise definition and explanation of "Berufsprestige" (occupational prestige), including how professions are ranked and which factors (income, education, social respect, measurement methods like surveys or prestige scales) determine those rankings. They may also be looking for example rankings or the term's relevance in sociology and labor research.	A document is relevant to the keyword "berufsprestige" if it contains a paragraph that defines or discusses occupational prestige, explains how it is measured (for example SIOPS, Treiman’s scale, or survey-based rankings), or gives concrete examples or lists of professions ranked by social status. Relevant documents will also analyze causes and consequences of berufsprestige—such as education, income, or cultural values—or present empirical results from surveys or cross‑country comparisons. Non‑relevant documents merely mentioning the word in passing, using "prestige" in a non‑occupational sense (brand prestige, product names), or containing only metadata, isolated tables, or code without explanatory text should be excluded. Edge cases include multilingual works where "berufsprestige" appears only in a bibliography or a translated term in an otherwise English discussion (potentially useful), and historical or marketing uses that resemble the concept but do not address its sociological meaning (likely not useful). In a German query context, German‑language paragraphs are preferable, but rigorous English analyses explicitly about occupational prestige are also relevant.
55226	arbeitsbelastung	The user is looking for a short paragraph about "Arbeitsbelastung" (workload/occupational stress). They likely want a concise explanation defining the term and summarizing common causes, effects, and/or strategies to manage it, suitable for a report or assignment.	A document is relevant to the keyword "arbeitsbelastung" when it addresses workload or occupational strain directly—discussing causes, measurements, health effects, legal duties, or interventions for work-related stress (for example a study measuring nurses’ workload, a company risk assessment, or guidance under Arbeitsschutzgesetz). Highly relevant texts include empirical papers with measurements or questionnaires (COPSOQ, surveys, physiological metrics), workplace case studies, occupational health guidance, or legal/regulatory discussions that explicitly use the term or close synonyms like "Belastung am Arbeitsplatz" or "Überlastung." Non-relevant documents merely containing the word once in passing, advertising copy that mentions workload without substantive content, or papers using "Arbeit" in the physics sense (work/energy) or discussing CPU/server load are not relevant to human occupational workload. Edge cases arise when the domain is ambiguous (IT/system "workload" vs. human "Arbeitsbelastung"), when only translations or metadata include the term, or when related topics such as "Arbeitszeit" or general stress are discussed without linking to work-specific burden—these require checking context to decide relevance. Practical signals of strong relevance are explicit populations, methods, outcomes, statistics, or intervention descriptions; weak signals are single-word occurrences, unrelated domains, or mere bibliographic mentions.
56202	arbeitsbelastungen	Looking for information on "arbeitsbelastungen" (workload/occupational strain): what types and causes exist, how they affect physical and mental health, and how to assess and manage or reduce them in the workplace.	A document is relevant to the keyword "arbeitsbelastungen" if it directly addresses workplace burdens or workloads—describing types (physical, mental, emotional), causes (long hours, understaffing, high tempo, role conflict), measurements (surveys, questionnaires, COPSOQ), consequences (stress, burnout, absenteeism) or mitigation strategies (ergonomics, job redesign, legal protections). Relevant examples include German-language occupational health reports, company risk assessments mentioning "Arbeitsbelastungen," research papers comparing workload across professions, or guides for works councils on reducing job strain. A document is non-relevant if the term appears only in passing, is used in a different sense (e.g., structural engineering loads, financial burdens unrelated to work), or if it treats unrelated populations without workplace context (e.g., student homework load only). Edge cases include materials about unpaid care work or home-office stress—these can be relevant if framed as "work" or occupational burden—and translations or singular/plural variants ("Arbeitsbelastung"/"arbeitsbelastungen") should be treated as matching the same topic.
5736	wohlfahrtsstaat	The user is seeking to measure attitudes toward the welfare state in Germany by presenting a list of statements about social inequalities and the role of state and economy; for each statement they want respondents to indicate one of four agreement levels (fully agree, rather agree, rather disagree, or completely disagree).	A document is relevant to the keyword "wohlfahrtsstaat" when it directly discusses the welfare state, social inequality, or the role of the state in providing social protection — for example policy analyses, descriptions of social transfers, or surveys of public attitudes toward social spending. The provided paragraph repeatedly asks respondents about "Staat und Wirtschaft" and "soziale Unterschiede," so it is relevant insofar as it gathers opinions tied to welfare‑state issues, but it contains little substantive analysis or concrete policy content. A non‑relevant document would only mention the word in passing, be unrelated (e.g., technical manuals, ads), or consist mainly of boilerplate repetition and spam that add no topical information. Edge cases include texts that treat "wohlfahrtsstaat" historically or comparatively (partially relevant) or questionnaires and survey prompts like this one (relevant for public opinion research but lower value for policy detail). Overall, this paragraph is topically on‑target but of limited usefulness without the actual statements or responses.
60378	führungsstil	The searcher wants a clear explanation of "Führungsstil" (leadership style), including its definition and common types with their key characteristics and effects on teams. They may also be seeking practical guidance on how to identify, compare, or develop an effective leadership style for a given context.	A document is relevant to the keyword "führungsstil" when it directly discusses leadership styles—definitions, typologies (e.g., authoritarian, democratic, laissez-faire, transformational), measurement tools, effects on team performance, or case studies in management contexts. For example, a German study comparing transformational and transactional Führungsstil in Mittelstand firms or a training manual describing how to adopt a participative Führungsstil would be highly relevant. Documents are non-relevant if they only mention the word in passing, use it as a metadata tag with no substantive content, or cover unrelated topics that happen to contain similar text (e.g., "Führerschein" or stylistic design guides). Edge cases include domain-specific treatments (military, nursing, software teams) that are relevant but narrow in scope, translations or documents in English that use "leadership style" instead of the German word, and OCR/typo variants like "fuhrungsstil"—these may be relevant but require normalization or user-intent clarification. Lastly, opportunistic content such as marketing blurbs or personality-quiz pages that superficially reference Führungsstil may be less useful for research despite matching the keyword.
6213	religionszugehörigkeit	The user is looking for standard survey wording and response categories for "religionszugehörigkeit" (religious affiliation), e.g., options like Catholic, Evangelical/Protestant, other, and none, often reported as percentages of the population. The underlying goal is to collect comparable data on respondents' religious denomination for analysis or presentation.	A document is relevant to the query "religionszugehörigkeit" if it discusses religious affiliation directly — for example survey items, census tables, or questionnaires that list response categories like Catholic, Evangelical/Protestant, Other, or None, or that report percentages of the population by religion. Items such as interview instructions, codebooks with numeric response options (1 = Catholic, 2 = Evangelical, 3 = Other, 4 = None), or questions about preferring to live in a predominantly Catholic or Protestant village are clearly relevant because they capture denominational belonging. Documents that are not relevant include theological essays, descriptions of religious rituals, institutional histories, or organizational mission statements that do not address individual affiliation or demographic coding. Borderline cases include texts that mention "religion" only as an explanatory factor (e.g., church tax laws) or that discuss belief/practice rather than formal affiliation — these can be partially relevant depending on whether they treat membership categories (Konfession, Religionsgemeinschaft) or only attitudes. Also consider language and form variations: German synonyms (Konfession, Religionsgemeinschaft) and translated questionnaires or scanned forms are relevant, though scanned images may require OCR to extract the affiliation data.
6346	worklifebalance	The user wants to know which policy or workplace measures would be most effective in helping Europeans reconcile private and working lives—given that about 45% of the labour market are women. They are seeking a recommendation or ranking of options (e.g., flexible hours, parental leave, affordable childcare, telework) that best support work–life balance.	A document is relevant to the query "worklifebalance" if it directly discusses measures that help people reconcile private and working lives in a European context — for example policies on parental leave, affordable childcare, flexible working hours, teleworking, care services, and gender-equal labour market measures — and backs claims with data or evaluations. Policy briefs, EU survey results, comparative country case studies, and program evaluations (e.g., showing how paid parental leave increased women's labour force participation from X% to Y%) are clear examples of relevant sources. Documents that are not relevant include those that only use the phrase superficially, discuss unrelated kinds of "balance" (financial balance sheets, fitness advice), or describe corporate perks without linking them to measurable reconciliation outcomes. Edge cases include pieces that cite the statistic in the paragraph (e.g., "45% of people in the labour market are women") but offer no policy analysis, outdated or non‑EU data that may not generalize, or materials focused on a single niche group (such as managers only) where conclusions won’t apply broadly.
6501	homosexualität	The user wants information about homosexuality in professional football, specifically how active players who come out are perceived and whether they would receive acceptance and support from teammates, fans, and institutions. They are asking about current attitudes, prevalence of openly gay active players, and examples or evidence of support or discrimination.	A document is relevant to the keyword "homosexualität" if it directly treats homosexuality as its subject—e.g., news reports or interviews about Thomas Hitzlsperger coming out, pieces on whether active professional footballers can or do come out, public reaction, anti-discrimination policies, or social-science research on attitudes toward gay athletes. Concrete examples of relevant documents include a German-language press article quoting Hitzlsperger, an interview with an active player about coming out, or an opinion piece on acceptance in football. Non-relevant documents merely containing the word in passing (for example a match report that briefly mentions a player's sexual orientation without discussion), using a different meaning, or unrelated pages (spam, unrelated biographies) should be excluded. Edge cases include content about homosexual behavior in animals or legal definitions of homosexuality—which may be tangentially relevant depending on user intent—as well as ambiguous mentions, translation errors, or private-person speculation that raise privacy and sensitivity concerns.
6534	kriminalitätsfurcht	The user wants to know whether there are any areas — especially within about one kilometer or elsewhere in their town/municipality — that people consider unsafe to walk alone at night. This information measures personal fear of crime and the perceived spatial distribution of neighbourhood safety.	A document is relevant to the keyword "kriminalitätsfurcht" (fear of crime) if it addresses people's perceptions of safety—especially references to not wanting to walk alone at night, descriptions of specific local areas or neighborhoods within a short distance (e.g., within one kilometer), survey questions or interview transcripts asking about such avoidance, or first‑hand reports like “I avoid the park after dark.” The repeated paragraph here clearly contains a survey/interview prompt about local night‑time avoidance, so any document containing that text would be highly relevant as it directly measures fear of crime in the immediate vicinity. Documents that only give raw crime statistics, legal definitions, or policy descriptions without linking them to residents’ perceived safety are generally non‑relevant, because they do not capture the subjective fear the query targets. Borderline cases include materials about crime prevention or policing that imply changes in fear (relevant if they report residents’ reactions) and noisy transcripts or repeated lines (like this paragraph) which are still relevant if they reflect the original survey wording or respondent answers.
6763	psychotherapie	The user wants a clear, concise explanation of psychotherapy—what it is, how it works, and when it’s used—plus basic information about common approaches (e.g., CBT, psychodynamic), expected outcomes, and how to find or access a therapist.	A document is relevant to the keyword "psychotherapie" if its main topic is psychotherapy—definitions, treatment methods (CBT, psychodynamic, humanistic, etc.), clinical evidence, indications, provider qualifications, access and insurance issues, or practical guidance for patients and clinicians. Highly relevant examples include clinical guidelines on psychotherapy for depression, research studies on therapeutic effectiveness, directories of licensed psychotherapists, and patient information pages explaining what psychotherapy entails. Non-relevant documents mention the word only peripherally (e.g., a news article that fleetingly references psychotherapy), focus on unrelated "therapy" topics (physical therapy, machine learning "therapy" metaphors), or use the term in a purely bibliographic list with no substantive content. Edge cases include pages about psychotherapy training, regulation, or accreditation (potentially relevant depending on intent), documents in other languages that nevertheless use the exact term "psychotherapie" (more relevant than generic translations), and compound or specialized terms (e.g., "Kunsttherapie" or "Psychotherapieforschung") which may be partially relevant depending on whether the user seeks general psychotherapy information or a specific subtopic.
7939	psychologie	The user is looking for a concise overview of "psychology" — what it studies (mind and behavior), its major subfields (e.g., clinical, cognitive, developmental, social), common research methods, and practical applications such as therapy, assessment, and career paths.	A document is relevant to the keyword "psychologie" if its main content directly discusses psychology topics — for example papers on cognitive processes, clinical therapy methods, developmental stages, psychological research findings, or program descriptions for a "psychologie" degree. Relevance is stronger when the term appears in headings, abstracts, or detailed sections rather than just a passing mention; an academic article about cognitive biases or a mental-health blog post that explains therapy techniques are clearly relevant. Non-relevant documents merely containing the word (e.g., a company name, an unrelated news story that quotes "psychologie" once, or an SEO page repeating the term without substantive content) should be excluded. Edge cases include multilingual pages where "psychologie" appears but most content is in another language, interdisciplinary works (e.g., social neuroscience) that partially focus on psychology, and course listings that name "psychologie" but provide no description — these can be borderline and require judging whether the psychological content is substantive.
810	bildungsgrad	The searcher wants a clear definition of the German term "Bildungsgrad" — the level or degree of formal education someone has attained. They likely seek how it’s classified or measured (e.g., school leaving certificates, vocational training, university degrees) for surveys, statistics, or personal profiles.	A document is relevant to the keyword "bildungsgrad" if it explicitly addresses educational attainment or "education level" — for example census tables, survey reports, academic papers, or datasets that define and report categories such as "no formal education", "primary", "secondary", or "tertiary." Relevant items will explain how the bildungsgrad is measured (question wording, age cutoffs, ISCED mapping), give breakdowns by demographics (age, region, income), or use the term in a German-language policy or research context. Non-relevant documents merely mentioning the word in passing, using "degree" in a non-educational sense (e.g., mathematical degree or temperature degree), or focusing on unrelated aspects of "Bildung" without classifying levels would not be useful. Edge cases include English-language sources that never use the German term but fully cover "education level" (these are relevant), and historical texts that use obsolete educational categories or inconsistent mappings — they may be relevant but require careful interpretation.
828	nachhaltigkeit	A user searching "Nachhaltigkeit" is likely looking for a clear definition and overview of sustainability, including its environmental, social, and economic dimensions. They may also want practical strategies, examples, metrics, or policies for implementing and measuring sustainable practices at personal, organizational, or societal levels.	A document is relevant to the query "nachhaltigkeit" if it directly addresses sustainability — for example discussions of environmental, social, or economic sustainability, corporate sustainability reports, lifecycle assessments, policy papers, or case studies of sustainable practices in energy, agriculture, or supply chains. Documents that only mention the word in passing (e.g., a single sentence in a long unrelated article), use it as a marketing buzzword without evidence, or treat it metaphorically are less relevant because they do not provide substantive information on the topic. Language and terminology matter: German-language content containing “Nachhaltigkeit” is an obvious match, but English texts using “sustainability” or domain-specific terms (e.g., circular economy, ESG, carbon footprint) are also relevant; misspellings, OCR errors, or translations can create edge cases where relevant material might be missed. Authority and timeliness affect relevance too — recent research, government guidelines, and NGO reports are typically more useful than outdated blog posts or product listings — while pages where the term only appears in metadata, comments, or unrelated contexts (homophones, names) should be treated as non-relevant.
928	corona	Wanting an overview of public attitudes and impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in Germany — how people perceive infection risks, government measures and restrictions, and their effects on health, finances, schools, healthcare capacity, masks and tracing apps, travel/borders, protests, EU and rescue packages, and willingness to vaccinate.	This document is relevant to the keyword "corona" because it explicitly discusses the coronavirus pandemic using direct terms and German compounds (e.g., Corona, Coronavirus, CoronaKrise, CoronaMaßnahmen) and covers many core topics such as infections, public-health measures (masks, apps, lockdowns), vaccination, schools, economic relief, and regional policy responses. Concrete signals of high relevance include named events and actors (Trump infected, Tönnies outbreak), specific policies (mask mandates, contact‑tracing app), and temporal markers (week numbers) that show it is focused on COVID‑19 developments. It would be non‑relevant if the same token "corona" appears with a different meaning (solar corona, Corona beer, the Ford Corona automobile, corona discharge in physics, or a person’s surname) or only as an incidental string in unrelated content. Edge cases include partially relevant documents that discuss economic or political effects without explicit reference to the virus (these are somewhat relevant), concatenated German compounds or misspellings (e.g., CoronaKrise, CoronaMaßnahmen) which should be treated as matches, and materials that mention COVID topics but are fictional, satirical, or conspiratorial, which may be lower quality despite keyword overlap.
9616	politikverdrossenheit	The user wants a concise paragraph explaining the German term "Politikverdrossenheit" (political disillusionment or apathy), including what it means, common causes, and its effects on civic participation. They likely need a short explanatory text suitable for an essay, article, or assignment.	Documents are relevant to the query "politikverdrossenheit" when they directly address political disaffection or apathy—explaining causes (e.g., corruption scandals, broken campaign promises, or economic inequality), describing manifestations (declining trust in parties, protest voting, youth disengagement, or falling turnout), or presenting measurements such as surveys and longitudinal studies. Relevant examples include empirical research on voter trust, news reports of a spike in non-voting after a scandal, policy analyses proposing re-engagement strategies, and comparative studies of political cynicism in Germany and other countries. Documents are not relevant when they only use the word in passing, focus on unrelated political topics (e.g., policy details without discussing attitudes), are purely promotional or spam, or treat "politics" in a generic sense without linking to disillusionment or participation. Edge cases include articles on low turnout that are relevant only if they connect turnout to attitudes; historical accounts are relevant if they trace causes or trends in disenchantment; and pieces using synonyms like "political apathy" or translations are relevant provided the conceptual link is clear.
