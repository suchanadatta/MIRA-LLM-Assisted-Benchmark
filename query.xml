<title>immigrant</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an overview of research on immigrants’ integration and impacts in host societies. Specifically, they want evidence on how immigration policy frameworks and the composition of inflows shape native attitudes, labor market outcomes, welfare/crime perceptions, and political behavior across countries, and what policies best support integration.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively focuses on immigrants as people residing in a receiving country—covering their experiences, integration, labor-market outcomes, health, legal treatment, political participation, or public attitudes/policy toward immigration (e.g., studies of EU8 immigrants in Germany, second-generation outcomes, or analyses of integrative vs restrictive policies). Morphological and related terms count when clearly about the same concept, such as immigration, immigrant-origin, first/second generation, or comparisons of refugees/economic migrants that speak to immigrant reception and impact. It is weakly or non-relevant if “immigrant” appears only in passing (titles, footnotes, metadata), is used metaphorically or in unrelated domains (e.g., “Immigrant Song,” animal “immigrants” in ecology), or discusses emigration/internal migration without linking to immigrants in a host society. Edge cases include country-specific policy evaluations, legal analyses of enforcement and criminalization, or media-framing studies—all relevant if immigrants are the core subject; by contrast, broad labor or cultural studies that do not distinguish immigrant status, or datasets where “immigrant” is incidental, are not. Even documents taking negative or positive stances, historical chapter outlines, or cross-national attitude surveys are relevant when immigrants are central to the research question.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks comprehensive surveys and datasets on immigrants and immigration in Germany and the EU, covering public attitudes, policy evaluation, skilled-worker migration, and immigrants’ integration and experiences, along with methodological and demographic details.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “immigrant” if it primarily discusses immigrants or immigration, such as public attitudes to immigration in Germany, integration outcomes, skilled worker admission, asylum/deportation policy, or survey-based findings on immigrant groups (e.g., ENTRA, EU MIDIS II, SCIP). Materials that present methods and demographics specifically for immigrant populations (e.g., sampling Italians, Poles, Syrians, Turks; second-generation studies), or analyze immigrant experiences like language acquisition, discrimination, labor market access, or party positions on immigration, also count as relevant. Items become weakly relevant or non-relevant when “immigrant” appears only tangentially within broad topics (e.g., general environment or rail-service modules) or when the primary focus is the general population with only a passing variable about immigrants. Edge cases include documents about refugees/asylum seekers or second-generation migrants, which are usually relevant if they address immigrant integration or policy; historical migration studies (e.g., 17th–20th century Berlin) are relevant if they focus on immigrant groups rather than generic mobility. Conversely, pieces centered on emigration from a country, generic “migration” without specifying immigrants in the destination, or where “immigrant” appears only in metadata or a single manifesto bullet without substantive analysis, are likely non-relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A request for survey questions and public-opinion measures about immigrants, covering attitudes on assimilation and cultural impact, economic effects, crime and jobs, illegal immigration/exclusion, and different immigrant origins (e.g., Eastern Europe, south of the Mediterranean, EU asylum seekers). The user likely wants to find or analyze questionnaire items that measure acceptance of immigrants and perceived societal impacts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant when immigrants are the central subject — for example when it contains survey items, policy statements, or analyses about immigrants’ economic, cultural, or legal impacts (e.g., questions on whether “immigrants increase crime rates,” “take jobs away,” “undermine culture,” or about “illegal immigrants” and “EU immigrants seeking political asylum”). Text that lists variable codes and repeated questionnaire items (Q9a, V52, v315–v318) is relevant if those codes map to substantive questions or responses, because it shows the document captures public attitudes and subgroup distinctions (Eastern Europe, South of the Mediterranean, other EU countries). A document is non‑relevant if “immigrant” appears only as a stray label, file code, or in an unrelated context (e.g., metadata, variable names with no question text), or if it actually discusses emigration, tourists, or student exchange rather than people settling. Edge cases include mixed or noisy transcripts (repeated lines, truncated items) and documents that mention immigrants but only in passing or at a different granularity (legal status vs cultural integration); relevance in those cases depends on whether the user cares about broad coverage of attitudes or only specific subtopics like asylum, crime, or labor market effects.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks methods for classifying immigrant background in German survey data (especially the Microcensus 2005–2009) and for measuring immigrants’ educational attainment. They need guidance on coding schemes, survey instrument options, and SAS/SPSS/Stata implementations, including approaches used in SOEP and NEPS.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “immigrant” when it substantively addresses immigrants as a population—such as classification of immigrant background, integration, outcomes, or policies—rather than merely mentioning the term. The provided paragraph is clearly relevant because it centers on classifying immigrant background in the German Microcensus, measuring immigrants’ educational attainment, and survey instruments (SOEP/NEPS) tailored to people with foreign qualifications. Materials that use close synonyms or related constructs (migrants, foreign-born, immigration studies) also count, while pieces focused on emigration, internal/domestic migration, or unrelated uses (e.g., a film titled “The Immigrant”) are non-relevant. Methodological texts are relevant if immigrants are the primary analytic target (e.g., coding foreign credentials or deriving years of education for migrant respondents), but not if immigrants are only a passing example in a generic methods discussion. Edge cases include metadata-only hits or bibliographies where “immigrant” appears without substantive content about immigrant populations, which should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>

<title>politik</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The query seeks scholarly overviews of “politics” that explain political decision-making and governance (e.g., public choice, principal–agent), the symbolic and media-mediated dimensions of politics, and how gender, ideology, and institutions shape political behavior. It also looks for applications such as protest as alternative politics, policy advice and evidence-based policymaking, refugee policy, and youth engagement.</desc>
	<narr>For the query “politik,” a document is relevant if it substantively treats politics in the German sense—political processes, institutions, actors, or policies—and uses terms like Politik, politisch, Politiker, or compounds such as Politikberatung or Flüchtlingspolitik in meaningful context. Examples of clearly relevant content include analyses of principal–agent problems in representative democracy, studies of politicians’ emotional expressivity in media, discussions of symbolic politics and politainment, policy advice and evidence-based policymaking, protest as alternative politics, political economy, or systems-theory views of political steering. A document is non-relevant if “Politik” appears only tangentially (e.g., as a throwaway line, in metadata, or as “Firmenpolitik” in a purely corporate/organizational sense) or if the focus is on unrelated domains like sport or culture without analytical linkage to political phenomena. Edge cases such as philosophical treatments (utopia/biopolitics), media–politics intersections, or football–politics overlaps are relevant when they analyze political power, communication, or decision-making, but purely metaphorical or linguistic uses without public/political substance are not. Morphological variants and topical compounds count toward relevance, whereas accidental substring matches or proper names without political analysis do not.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks survey-based resources on politics—primarily in Germany—covering media’s role and influence, journalist–politician relations, and public trust. It also spans attitudes toward democracy, parties and politicians, political participation (including women and nonvoters), election behavior, and demographic correlates.</desc>
	<narr>For the query “politik,” a document is relevant if it substantively addresses politics or public policy—e.g., government institutions, parties, elections, media’s role in democracy, voter behavior, public opinion, or issues like equality and reunification. Content such as survey reports or codebooks detailing topics like media influence on political trust, party identification, non-voter motivations, democracy satisfaction, or attitudes toward politicians clearly qualifies. It is non‑relevant if “Politik” appears only as a passing term or in non-political senses, such as corporate “Firmenpolitik,” school rules, or product/brand names, or if the text is primarily methodological without political substance. Edge cases include documents where “Politik” appears inside compounds (e.g., Medienpolitik, Gleichstellungspolitik), which are still relevant, and materials in German that omit the exact keyword but cover synonymous topics (Regierung, Demokratie, Wahlen), which should be considered relevant despite keyword mismatches. Conversely, metadata or tag-only mentions of “Politik” with body text about unrelated topics would be marginal or non-relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for survey items and response codes measuring public attitudes toward politicians — e.g., whether politicians keep their promises, which parties’ politicians are seen as most/least trustworthy (SPD, FDP, Republicans, Greens, none), and perceived influence of banks on politics. They also want questions that record how many and which politicians respondents name and which politicians should not become federal ministers.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "politik" when it substantively discusses politics or political actors — for example it contains items about Politiker, party names (SPD, FDP, Republikaner, GRÜNE), questions on whether politicians keep promises, the influence of banks on politics, or survey instruments labeled F.19 with answer codes. Relevance is strengthened by repeated political question wording and metadata like variable IDs (V242, V247) that indicate a political survey or questionnaire rather than a passing mention. A document is non-relevant if "politik" appears only once or as part of a non-political phrase (e.g., a company policy, course title, or isolated token) and there is no substantive discussion of political topics. Edge cases include texts about specific subfields such as Außenpolitik or Realpolitik (these are relevant but narrower in scope), badly formatted transcripts or duplicated lines (which may still be useful if they are a political survey), and language mismatches — German-language political content is clearly relevant for the query "politik," whereas documents using the English word "policy" may not be unless intent is broader.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks information on survey instruments and pretested questionnaire modules measuring political interest, socio-political attitudes, engagement, and self-efficacy in German studies. They want details from projects like PIAAC-L, GLES 2021, LoneCovid, and RISS, including topics covered and the cognitive interview methods used.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “politik” if it substantively covers political topics such as political interest, socio-political attitudes, engagement, trust in politics, or election research—for example, scales on political interest, modules from the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) about politics and society, or measures of political alienation and engagement. Content describing how projects examine political behavior or attitudes (e.g., trust in politics during Covid-19, compliance with political measures, youth self-efficacy in political contexts) is clearly relevant. Documents that only mention politics tangentially—such as referring to “policy and practice” dissemination in a methods or infrastructure description without analyzing political phenomena—are less relevant. Purely methodological passages (e.g., cognitive interview procedures) are non-relevant unless tied to measuring political constructs. Edge cases include projects centered on social or educational topics that still include explicit political variables (e.g., self-efficacy in political life), which should be considered relevant, whereas occurrences of “Politik” only in institutional names or boilerplate should not.</narr>

<title>politic</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks research on what drives political participation and engagement, focusing on how political knowledge, interest, internal efficacy, media use, education, and institutional context shape different forms of participation. They want comparative evidence and mechanisms (e.g., mediation effects) across countries and generations, covering voting, conventional/unconventional activism, political consumerism, and related attitudes like trust.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively discusses politics and contains the keyword “politic” or its common variants (political, politics, politician), for example in phrases like “political participation,” “internal political efficacy,” or “political knowledge.” Studies of political behavior, institutions, or theory—such as work on political symbolism, political geography, or political consumerism—are also relevant when these terms are used in analytical text, not just in passing. A document is non-relevant if “politic” appears only as the adjective meaning “prudent” (e.g., “a politic choice”) or shows up solely in boilerplate, references, or metadata without real discussion of politics. Edge cases include near-terms like “policy,” “police,” or “polity,” and foreign-language cognates such as German “Politik” or French “politique,” which are topically related but may not match a strict “politic” query unless stemming or multilingual normalization is applied. High keyword frequency from duplicated passages or citation lists should not by itself determine relevance; the content should analyze or report on political phenomena.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks surveys and datasets on political behavior and culture—covering post-election dynamics, trust in institutions, left-right orientations, participation, socialization, and the interplay between politics and media (including social media)—across various countries and groups (citizens, journalists, students, teachers). It aims to compile evidence on media influence, political communication, extremism, and related demographics/methods, including special cases like GDR political prisoner estimates and comparative election studies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it discusses politics in substance—e.g., elections, parties, voting behavior, left–right orientations, citizen trust in institutions, media influence on democracy, political communication, or policy debates—like the surveys on post-election developments, media’s role in politics, political participation, and attitudes toward extremism. Content analyzing political journalism, opinion polls, social media as a political information source, or historical topics such as political prisoners in the GDR also qualifies, as do demographic variables when they are tied to political attitudes or behavior. It may be borderline if it treats media use, education, or social engagement without a clear political link, or if “politic” only appears in coding fields or boilerplate without substantive political discussion. Non-relevant cases include uses of “politic” as an adjective meaning “prudent,” brand or platform names (e.g., Politico) without political content, or unrelated topics where “politic” occurs only as a substring or in tangential metadata. Edge cases include studies centered on students or women where politics is one section—these are relevant if they measure political interest, participation, or opinions, but not if they focus exclusively on non-political life conditions.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for survey items measuring political attitudes and engagement. Specifically, they want questions about whether political parties are necessary, frequency of political discussion (in class and with friends), political information exposure, political interest and participation, how politics influences one’s life, and preferences for ideal party characteristics.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "politic" when its primary content addresses political subjects—public institutions, political parties, civic participation, political opinions or survey items about politics—and provides substantive text (e.g., questions like "Are political parties necessary?" or passages about discussing politics in class). Clear examples of relevance are survey prompts about party ideals, questions on political activity or influence, and paragraphs explaining party functions or political discussion. A document is non-relevant if it only contains the substring "politic" in metadata, variable codes, filenames, or as an adjective meaning "prudent" rather than discussing politics substantively. Edge cases include references to "office" or "family politics" (interpersonal maneuvering) which are relevant only if the intended focus is public/policy politics; similarly, long lists of repeated variable labels or template wording mention politics but offer little topical content and should be scored as low-utility relevance.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is looking for an overview of validated instruments to measure political attitudes and behaviors (e.g., efficacy, cynicism, participation, conservatism, national/pride), including their psychometric properties, translations, and cross-national comparability. They also seek guidance on using web tracking data for political research and expert insights on social media’s impact on democracy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “politic” when it substantively discusses politics, political behavior, political systems, or political attitudes, including morphological variants like political, politics, politician, and politicization. The provided paragraph is highly relevant because it centers on political constructs and measures (e.g., political participation subscales, PEKS/PESS efficacy scales, Perceived Political Self-Efficacy, system satisfaction, conservatism, national and political pride, partisan identity) and connects methods like web tracking to topics in political communication and democracy, even featuring an interview about social media’s impact on democratic processes. Methodological content remains relevant when it directly measures or analyzes political phenomena (e.g., validity, reliability, and cross-national invariance of political scales), whereas a purely technical web-tracking guide without any link to political outcomes would be less relevant. Non-relevant matches would include uses of “politic” meaning “prudent” in etiquette or business advice, or incidental mentions (e.g., a citation list where “political” appears without substantive discussion). Edge cases include terms like “body politic” or debates about the “politicization” of research; these are relevant if they engage political institutions, attitudes, or behavior, but borderline if they only invoke the term metaphorically without political content.</narr>

<title>politisches interesse</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The query seeks research on political interest—its measurement, trends over time, and key determinants such as education, age, gender, class, and political orientation—and how it affects participation and voting. It focuses largely on evidence from Germany (e.g., ALLBUS surveys), including youth dynamics, euroskepticism, and the roles of resources and media.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly examines or measures citizens’ political interest, its determinants, trends, or effects—for example, analyses using ALLBUS 1980–2002 that test education, age, gender, party support, and cohort/period influences, or reports showing that higher education predicts greater political interest. Studies that link political interest to mobilization and behavior (e.g., euroskeptics’ turnout and party choice, or politainment’s impact moderated by interest) are also relevant, as are works that define political interest versus apathy and document youth or gender gaps with indicators and empirical results. By contrast, texts about “Interessen” as group or institutional interests—such as federal mixed financing, interest representation of the homeless, or religious “interest” as a legitimacy device—are non-relevant unless they explicitly analyze individuals’ interest in politics. Edge cases include pieces that only mention political interest without data or theory (weak relevance) and educational or DDR studies that assess interest in political/ideological learning, which are relevant if they operationalize and report measures of political interest.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks survey data and research on political interest and participation, including measures like campaign/election interest, party identification, perceived efficacy, media use, socialization, and demographics. They are especially interested in gender differences (e.g., among women by education and East/West region) and perceptions of equality in Germany, with some comparative context.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly measures or discusses political interest (politisches Interesse/Politikinteresse), such as self-assessed interest in politics, interest in election campaigns or outcomes, or the political interest of parents, and often ties this to media use, political discussions, or participation. Examples include surveys of women’s interest in different policy fields, student or youth studies tracking interest before/after major events, and datasets listing variables like interest in politics, campaign attention, or frequency of political information seeking. Proxies also count, such as indices or scales capturing political engagement, talk frequency about politics with family or peers, or intensity of consuming political news, even if the exact keyword appears only in variable labels. Non-relevant are texts where “Interesse” refers to non-political topics (e.g., music or TV genres without a political link) or to “interests” as group advantages (e.g., class or national interests) rather than an individual’s interest in politics. Edge cases include alternative phrasings (Interesse an Politik, politisches Interesse des Vaters), historical DDR/BRD contexts where “Interessen der Werktätigen” is not the target concept, and documents on participation that omit any measure or discussion of political interest.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A user searching for "politisches Interesse" wants measures or survey items that assess how interested someone is in politics and related attitudes. Specifically, they are looking for questions that ask respondents to rate their political interest on a 0–10 ladder, name whether a party represents their interests, and indicate how much they care about the interests/living conditions of various groups (family, neighbours, region, fellow countrymen, Europeans, humankind, elderly, unemployed, sick/disabled, immigrants) plus rankings of which social groups (workers, employees/civil servants, farmers, middle class, upper class) should be represented.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "politisches interesse" when it explicitly addresses interest in politics or contains survey items that measure political interest, such as ladder-scale questions ("Stufen Sie bitte Ihr Interesse an Politik..."), direct labels like "Politikinteresse" or items asking how much respondents care about political representation and parties. Examples of clearly relevant content are the German questionnaire items asking respondents to rate their interest on a 0–10 ladder, questions about whether a party represents their interests, and lists of concerns for social groups (elderly, immigrants, neighbours) tied to political attitudes. A document is non-relevant if it only uses the word "Interessen" in non-political senses (economic or organizational interests), consists solely of metadata or codes (e.g., V183, variable labels) without the substantive questions, or mentions politics only tangentially (e.g., a news headline listing "Bundeswehr" without discussion of citizens' political interest). Edge cases include fragments or bilingual texts: a short extract containing the ladder question or "Politikinteresse" is highly relevant even if brief, whereas a list of social groups (workers, farmers, entrepreneurs) is only partially relevant unless it is explicitly framed as political priorities or demands.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking survey instruments and validated items for measuring political interest, especially brief scales from CSES Module 5 within German pretest studies, including item wording and psychometric properties. They also want context on related constructs (e.g., political efficacy, cynicism) and how these measures were cognitively tested and implemented.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly defines, measures, or reports on “politisches Interesse” (political interest), for example by describing a two‑item scale asking how interested respondents are in politics or by detailing modules like CSES that include political interest items. It is also relevant if it discusses pretests, validation, reliability, or cognitive interviewing of political-interest measures, or uses political interest as a key variable in explaining participation or vote choice. Documents that focus only on adjacent constructs—political efficacy (PEKS), political cynicism (KPZ), conservatism (SECS GER), asylum attitudes, or environmental engagement—are non‑relevant unless they explicitly include a political-interest item or subscale. References to datasets, coding tools, or infrastructure without a tie to measuring interest (e.g., CAMCES for education, migration-typology coding, regional keys like AGS/NUTS) are non‑relevant. Edge cases include inventories that merely name political interest among many topics (minimally relevant), synonym phrasing like Politikinteresse or “Interesse an Politik” (relevant), and uses of “interest” in the economic sense (interest rates or inflation expectations) which are not relevant.</narr>

<title>religion</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking scholarly analyses of religion’s role in modern societies, focusing on how it intersects with the state, politics, inequality, nationalism, and civil society. They want comparative and empirical research on secularization trends, state regulation and favoritism, public attitudes, and the social and economic effects of religiosity across countries.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “religion” when it substantively examines religion as belief, practice, community, or institution, or analyzes how religion intersects with politics, economics, law, identity, or social inclusion. Clear examples include research on religion in International Relations, youth movements like New Age/evangelicalism/Salafism, cross-national measures of state regulation or favoritism toward religion, and studies linking religion to nationalism, welfare attitudes, or economic development. Region- or method-focused works (e.g., the Oxford Handbook on Ireland, post-communist civil society, ISSP/WVS-based analyses) are relevant when religion is the central analytic category rather than a passing descriptor. Non-relevant items are those that invoke “religion” only metaphorically, mention it in passing without analysis, or discuss culture/national identity without engaging religious beliefs, institutions, or religiosity. Edge cases that should still count as relevant include studies of secularization, “no religion,” interfaith marriage, church–state policy, or “religiosity” under different labels (faith, public religion), whereas pieces that only cite “religion” in a title or dataset metadata without discussing it are not.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks social survey datasets and variables on religion—affiliation, beliefs, practices—and how these relate to politics, values, voting, and demographics. The focus is largely Germany (censuses, ALLBUS, World Youth Day) with comparative international modules on church–state relations, moral issues, and societal attitudes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “religion” when it substantively addresses religious beliefs, practices, affiliations, or the social and political role of religion—for example, surveys on belief in God or an afterlife, church attendance, denominational membership, secularization trends, religious education, or the influence of churches on government and voting. Materials analyzing attitudes toward other faiths, acceptance of religious out-groups, World Youth Day participation and its impact, or religion–science tensions also clearly qualify. By contrast, content that only mentions “religion” in passing (e.g., as a single demographic checkbox, a variable label, or a venue name) without analysis, or discussions of politics and social issues that lack any explicit religious dimension, would be non-relevant. Edge cases include broad social surveys: they are relevant if they contain dedicated modules or multiple measures on religiosity (as in the examples listed), but only weakly relevant if religion appears as a minor, optional item. Similarly, datasets reporting legal church membership without addressing beliefs or practice may be relevant for affiliation queries but not for questions about lived religiosity or theology.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking to capture the respondent’s childhood religion (e.g., Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, indigenous, other, or none) and any specific denomination, and to record spouse’s, mother’s, and father’s religions. They also want those answers mapped into compressed religion group variables (RELIGGRP) with country-specific question mappings for use in comparative survey analysis.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "religion" when it contains survey question text, coding schemes, or derived variables that explicitly capture religious affiliation or upbringing—such as items asking "What religion if any were you raised in?", follow-ups about denomination, or fields for spouse's, mother's, or father's religion. Relevant examples include compressed group variables like RELIGGRP, country-specific question variants (e.g., Q20a in Georgia, Q22 in Kenya), and prompts that list response categories (Protestant, Catholic, Muslim, Jewish, indigenous beliefs, no religion). Documents are non-relevant if they only mention "religion" metaphorically or discuss theological/historical topics without providing survey items, variable names, or coding needed for data harmonization. Edge cases to watch: records that use different labels for the same category (e.g., "no religion" vs. "none"), "other/indigenous beliefs" entries that require recoding, and snippets that contain variable IDs (V52, Q22) or repeated boilerplate—these are relevant for mapping but may need normalization or additional context to be fully useful.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking details on psychological measures related to religion, specifically scales that assess parental religious upbringing/religiosity and the thought–action fusion construct (including the “moral religion” subdimension). They want to understand how these instruments operationalize family socialization factors and relate to attitudes toward in- and out-groups.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “religion” if it substantively discusses religiosity, religious upbringing, or moral-religious dimensions—for example, describing how parents’ religiosity shapes children’s in-group/out-group attitudes or detailing a “moral religion (MR)” subscale within a psychological measure. Content that operationalizes religion (e.g., items measuring parental religious socialization or thought-action fusion specifically in moral-religious contexts) also counts as relevant because it treats religion as a construct under study, not just a passing mention. By contrast, a document is non-relevant if “religion” appears only tangentially (such as a brief label in a scale with no further treatment) or if the focus is purely on general cognitive bias without any specific religious dimension. Edge cases include texts that use acronyms like MR without clarifying the religious component, or that discuss “spirituality” or “faith” as proxies for religiosity—these can be relevant if they explicitly connect to religious beliefs or practices, but not if they remain entirely secular or metaphorical.</narr>

<title>persönlichkeit</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an overview of personality (Persönlichkeit)—its definitions, development, and measurement (e.g., Big Five)—and how personality relates to work, learning/therapy, identity, and social-political attitudes such as authoritarianism, prejudice, and populism.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it analyzes personality as a psychological or sociological construct—defining traits, measuring them (e.g., Big Five), tracing their development or change, or linking personality to outcomes such as work socialization, prejudice, learning, or well-being. Empirical studies on the authoritarian personality, longitudinal research on how early career shapes personality, neurosci explanations of how personality forms, or methods papers proposing short personality scales are strong matches. Content that centers on “personalities” as notable individuals (e.g., historical or scientific personalities) is only relevant if it explicitly theorizes personality formation or attributes in those figures, not merely profiles or reputational narratives. Items focused on identity, culture, or class are borderline unless they directly tie identity constructs to personality traits or development. Edge cases include metaphorical or collective uses (e.g., “collective personality” of a group) and educational or therapeutic frameworks that place personality at the core; these are relevant when they articulate how personality is conceptualized, measured, or changed, and less so if “Personality” is used loosely without analytical depth.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks social survey data and analyses related to personality and personal identity, including the scales used and evaluations of personality traits across groups and nations. They are especially interested in findings from East/West German longitudinal studies linking personality to political interest, attitudes toward other nations, and life conditions.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it contains the German keyword “Persönlichkeit” or close variants and uses it in context, such as personality traits, personal identity, or the portrayal/evaluation of persons. Clear hits include phrases like “persönliche Identität Skala,” “Bewertung von Persönlichkeits- und sozialen Eigenschaften,” “Darstellung der Persönlichkeit August Bebels,” or “Sympathie für politische Persönlichkeiten,” as they explicitly invoke the term. Non-relevant items are those discussing politics, media use, or demographics that never include the string or only use related adjectives like “persönliche” without the noun when exact-match retrieval is required. Edge cases include plural and compounds (e.g., “Persönlichkeiten,” “Persönlichkeitsentwicklung,” “Persönlichkeits-”), hyphenation or OCR breaks (“Persönlichkeits und sozialenEigenschaften”), and diacritic variants (“Persoenlichkeit,” “personlichkeit”). Also note the semantic ambiguity: references to “Persönlichkeiten” as notable figures are keyword matches but may be less relevant if the user intended personality-as-traits, whereas identity and personality-scale content is strongly on-target.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants personality assessments that respondent “B” holds about a list of German politicians (e.g., Hannelore Kraft, Claudia Roth, Helmut Kohl, etc.), i.e., who B thinks what about each. They also seek the corresponding scale scores and deviations ("Skalometer politischer Persönlichkeiten" and "Abweichung") for those political figures to compare and analyze perceived personalities.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "persönlichkeit" when it discusses individual persons’ character, reputation, or evaluative judgments — for example lines like "Was hält B von H. Kraft" (what B thinks of Hannelore Kraft) or entries titled "Skalometer politischer Persönlichkeiten" that measure or rate politicians’ traits are strong signals of relevance. Documents that merely list names or repeated index entries without descriptive text (e.g., long duplicate name lists) are less relevant because they do not convey personality information. Meta-data such as numeric deviations ("Abweichung") or a score-sheet is relevant only if it is accompanied by interpretation (what the score says about a person); raw tables or IDs alone are borderline. Language and sense disambiguation matter: German-language profiles of political figures match the query closely, while documents using "personality" in the sense of celebrity branding or psychometric testing can be relevant but require confirming context. Finally, short or noisy fragments (repeated lines, navigation labels, or file names) are non-relevant edge cases unless they link to substantive profiles or measured assessments.</narr>

	<desc>The user is looking for German-language psychometric instruments to measure personality and related constructs—such as Big Five (BFI-10), right-wing authoritarianism, social desirability (KSE-G), interpersonal trust/morality, and attitudes toward military interventions—along with evidence of their validity/reliability and guidelines for documenting survey measures in social and behavioral research.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “persönlichkeit” if it focuses on personality as a psychological construct, its theories, or its measurement—e.g., discussing the Big Five (BFI-10), authoritarian personality/Right-Wing Authoritarianism (Altemeyer’s subdimensions), PASK5, 16PF, or NEO-PI-R, and how these tools capture individual differences. Content that links attitudes (trust/mistrust, moral judgments, acceptance of military interventions) explicitly to personality models or scales is also relevant—for instance, using RWA items to operationalize authoritarian aggression or conventionalism. Methodological discussions are relevant when they document or validate personality instruments or adjacent controls like social desirability (KSE-G) in the context of personality assessment; they are less relevant if they only outline generic survey documentation standards without a clear tie to personality constructs. Non-relevant items include uses of “Persönlichkeit” in non-psychological senses (brand personality, character in literature), legal topics like Persönlichkeitsrecht, or policy analyses of military interventions that do not operationalize personality. Edge cases include scales like KSE-G: relevant when used to interpret or adjust personality data, but not when presented in isolation unrelated to personality measurement.</narr>

<title>persönlichkeitsmerkmale</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks academic information on personality traits and their measurement (e.g., Big Five, authoritarianism) and how these traits relate to outcomes such as political knowledge and attitudes, educational transitions, work behavior, and social engagement. They are interested in survey-based studies, validation of brief scales, and comparisons of personality effects with demographic or contextual factors.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly examines, measures, or models Persönlichkeitsmerkmale (personality traits) or closely synonymous constructs (e.g., Persönlichkeitsfaktoren), such as studies using Big Five scales, authoritarism/alienation indices, or validated short instruments, and if it links these traits to outcomes (political knowledge, partnership conflict, police selection, student performance, volunteering). It is also relevant when it focuses on methodological issues of trait measurement (scale validation, factor analyses) or reports clear associations between trait profiles and behaviors or attitudes (e.g., right/materialist orientations among highly authoritarian individuals, time-perspective profiles tied to traits). Documents that merely discuss Persönlichkeitsentwicklung (personality development) or identity in broad terms without specifying or operationalizing traits, or that mention traits only in passing without analysis, are non-relevant. Edge cases include studies on adjacent constructs (e.g., technophile attitudes or “Kompetenzerwartung”) that function as trait-like dispositions—these can be relevant if explicitly treated as Persönlichkeitsmerkmale, but not if framed solely as situational attitudes or institutional factors. Synonym and morphology variations in German (e.g., Persönlichkeitsfaktoren, Merkmale der Persönlichkeit) count, while generic uses of “persönlich” or purely institutional analyses without trait variables do not.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking information on personality traits—how they are defined and measured—and their relationships with political attitudes, education, health behaviors, and social integration. They appear interested in German surveys and longitudinal studies that assess personality characteristics and their development among students and youth, and how these traits relate to outcomes like academic success, career paths, and civic attitudes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “persönlichkeitsmerkmale” when it explicitly measures, analyzes, or reports personality traits (e.g., via named scales, item batteries, or self-assessments) rather than merely mentioning the term. Clear positives include surveys of students or workers that list “leistungsrelevante/studienrelevante Persönlichkeitsmerkmale,” Big-Five-like constructs, self-control/impulsivity, empathy, dogmatism or rigidity scales, and datasets (e.g., BIBB/BAuA follow-up, GLES modules, Values in Crisis) that contain dedicated personality items alongside demographics. Documents are only partially relevant when “Persönlichkeitsmerkmale” appears in a topic list without corresponding variables, measurement details, or results, or when traits are treated tangentially to broader themes such as ideology, study success, or health. They are non-relevant if the word is used in a non-psychological sense, if no trait constructs or measurements are present, or if content focuses solely on attitudes or behaviors without linking them to stable personality dimensions. Edge cases include DDR-era studies using compound phrases (e.g., leiterrelevante/studienrelevante Persönlichkeitsmerkmale) or synonyms like Eigenschaften/Persönlichkeitsentwicklung; these are relevant only when they clearly denote measured personality traits rather than vague character descriptions or expectations.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants a clear overview of personality traits and how to evaluate their own characteristics. They are looking for definitions of common traits (e.g., the Big Five) and simple guidance or items to self-assess where they see themselves.</desc>
	<narr>The query "persönlichkeitsmerkmale" seeks information about personality traits, so a document that helps someone identify or describe typical traits is relevant. The provided paragraph is in German and repeatedly prompts the reader to "assess yourself," which is directly related to eliciting information about personality and therefore partially relevant. However, it is low-quality for this query because it contains no specific trait names (for example, introversion, conscientiousness, openness), no definitions, scoring, or examples, and is cluttered with repeated lines and "br" artifacts. A fully relevant document would include trait lists or models (Big Five), behavioral indicators, example items or scoring guidance, whereas this text might only be useful as a brief survey prompt or starting instruction but not as substantive information. Edge cases: it could be acceptable if the user wanted a short questionnaire header, but it is non-relevant if the user expects definitions, research, or concrete trait descriptions.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking information on personality traits as measured by German-language instruments, such as mood (Stimmungsskala) and self-control scales, including their theoretical bases. They also want to understand how these traits are used as determinants in research on conceptions of democracy and preferences for democratic procedures.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly discusses personality traits (Persönlichkeitsmerkmale) as stable dispositions, defines or theorizes them, or presents instruments that measure them—for example, a mood scale conceptualized as a trait with factors like mood disposition and reactivity, or a 23-item Self-Control Scale grounded in Gottfredson and Hirschi’s theory. Content linking traits to outcomes (e.g., how self-control relates to deviant behavior) or to broader research contexts (such as determinants of democratic procedure preferences) also counts as relevant. It may be partially relevant if it mentions personality traits only as one of several determinants without detailing them, or if it uses near-synonyms like trait, disposition, or Eigenschaft. Non-relevant would be texts that treat mood purely as a transient state rather than a trait, or that use “Merkmale” to mean demographics or procedural attributes (e.g., features of democratic processes) with no substantive treatment of personality constructs. Edge cases include mixed-methods pretests where traits are noted but not operationalized, or surveys that list “Persönlichkeitsmerkmale” without providing scales, definitions, or examples.</narr>

<title>sexuelle orientierung</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking research and resources on sexual orientation, especially in Germany. Focus areas include prevalence of sexual minorities, coming-out experiences, links with mental health, discrimination and human rights, and institutional responses across healthcare, education, sports, law, and family policy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it engages directly with sexual orientation (sexuelle Orientierung) as a core topic—defining or categorizing identities (e.g., heterosexual, bisexual, homosexual), measuring prevalence, or examining coming out, discrimination, health, policy, or family/education impacts. Examples include surveys that stratify respondents by orientation to analyze mental health outcomes, studies of LSBT youth reporting discrimination and support needs, or human-rights/healthcare guidance that addresses protections and treatment specific to sexual orientation. Content is non-relevant when “sexual” refers to different issues (e.g., sexual harassment policies) or when sexual orientation is only name-checked in a glossary or a broad diversity list without substantive discussion. Edge cases: pieces centered on SOGI or queer critiques of hetero/homonormativity are relevant; works about gender identity alone (geschlechtliche Identität) without linking to orientation, or cultural items (e.g., theater, sports debates) that mention orientation only in passing, are marginal.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks surveys and datasets on sexual orientation that capture experiences, attitudes, and behaviors of LGBTQ+ people—covering daily life, relationships, sexual practices, HIV/STI knowledge and prevention, discrimination, and social context—mainly in Germany and the EU. They want to identify relevant studies (e.g., EU LGBTI II, Eurobarometer) and the variables/questionnaire content for comparative analysis.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to “sexuelle Orientierung” if it explicitly treats sexual orientation—such as self-identification (heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual), patterns of attraction or behavior with same- or opposite-sex partners, coming out, or discrimination and social experiences tied to being LGBTI. Examples include survey modules asking for current heterosexual/homosexual orientation, men 16–65 being asked about sexual relations with men, studies on everyday problems of homosexuals or lesbians, or the EU FRA LGBTI II survey reporting on bias and violence due to sexual orientation. Non‑relevant would be materials focused only on AIDS/STI knowledge, condom use, contraception, or general “Wertorientierungen” (value orientations) without linking them to sexual orientation, as well as content about gender identity (trans/intersex) that omits orientation. Edge cases include texts where “Orientierung” means life values or school orientation sessions (false positives), and studies that don’t ask identity but allow inference via partner gender—these can still be relevant as proxies. German synonyms like sexuelle Identität or Ausrichtung, and modules restricted to subgroups (e.g., homosexuelle Männer, lesbische Frauen), also count as relevant even if the exact keyword appears sparsely.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for information about sexual orientation, especially public attitudes and survey measures in Germany — for example views on same-sex relationships, experiences and prevalence of sexual harassment at work, and opinions about legal protections and institutional sexual abuse. They likely want sample survey question wording, public-opinion results, or summaries of how these topics are discussed in recent debate.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "sexuelle orientierung" if it explicitly treats sexual orientation or public attitudes toward it — for example survey items or analyses that use terms like "Homosexualität", "sexuelle Beziehungen zwischen zwei Erwachsenen des gleichen Geschlechts", or variable codes (e.g. ISSP/V400–V447) that ask respondents about same‑sex relationships or homophobia. Concrete examples of relevant content are questionnaire items asking "How do you feel about sexual relationships between two adults of the same sex," behavioral‑attitude measures toward homosexuality, or legal/policy discussions that concern lesbians, gays or bisexual people. Documents that only discuss sexual harassment of women, workplace flirtation, or sexual abuse in the church without any link to sexual orientation are non‑relevant, since they address different phenomena (gendered violence or child abuse rather than orientation). Edge cases include texts that mention homosexuality only incidentally inside broader harassment or abuse reports (these are partially relevant if they address orientation‑based harassment) and pieces conflating sexual orientation with gender identity — those require closer inspection to decide relevance.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks documentation on how sexual orientation is measured in German social surveys, especially the FReDA panel (waves 6a and 2b), including the specific items, their development/adaptation, and results of cognitive online pretests (web probing). They want to understand the survey context (e.g., household composition, fertility, affective touch, transnational families) in which these sexual orientation questions are embedded.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to “sexuelle orientierung” when it directly discusses sexual orientation as a survey topic, measure, or analytical focus—for example, the FReDA W6a and W2b modules that include questions on household composition and sexual orientation, affective touch, and support in transnational families, with details on cognitive pretesting via web probing. By contrast, many uses of “Orientierung” here are unrelated (e.g., collective/team orientation, political left–right orientation, religious orientation, causal orientations) and should not be considered matches for sexual orientation. Mentions such as the fascism scale’s “Überbetonung des Sexuellen,” general gender equality items, or family climate scales concern other constructs and are non-relevant to the query. An edge case is when sexual orientation is only listed among many topics without item detail; that can be borderline, but tying it to specific FReDA waves and instruments increases relevance. Content on climate change, managerial practices, or guidelines for online survey documentation is unrelated and should not influence retrieval for this query.</narr>

<title>personal</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The query seeks scholarly works related to “personal,” emphasizing personality traits (e.g., Big Five) and their effects on behavior, social decision-making, politics, education, and participation. It also spans personalization in media, personal privacy and data protection, and legal/philosophical notions of personhood and legal personality (including AI).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “personal” when it explicitly discusses personal aspects, such as privacy and personal data, personal relevance in judgments, or personalized content and communication (e.g., analyses of personal data protection in Russia, experiments on personal relevance in justice inferences, studies of personalized news portals or personalized political tweets). Content using close morphological variants like “personalized,” “personalization,” or “personal data” typically qualifies, while terms like “interpersonal” can be borderline because they concern between-person dynamics rather than an individual’s personal sphere. By contrast, pieces focused on “personality” traits or “legal personality” (e.g., Big Five effects on grades, AI legal personality) may be non-relevant if the user intends “personal” in the sense of privacy, individuality, or personalization, despite lexical overlap. Near-spelling terms such as “personnel,” or philosophical uses of “person”/“personhood” without a focus on personal information or individualized content, should be treated as non-relevant. Edge cases include documents where “personal” appears only in passing (titles, citations) or in compound phrases like “personal distribution of income”; these are relevant only if the main discussion centers on personal-level topics rather than incidental mention.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks social survey datasets focused on personal attitudes, experiences, and behaviors in Germany and the EU. Topics span EU opinions, online privacy/data protection, political communication, social and family networks, religion, health and medication costs, fear of crime, and population displacement, with detailed demographics and survey metadata.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if “personal” refers to individual-level information, attitudes, experiences, or actions and is a central theme, such as protection of online personal data, willingness to provide personal information, personal financial shares for medications, political communication in the personal environment, or measures of personal identity, trust, devoutness, or health. For example, surveys about explicit personal approval before data processing, concerns about personal data being used without consent, personal net income, personal illness, or personal use of the internet would qualify. Documents are non-relevant when “personal” is absent, incidental, or merely lexical noise—e.g., tables about “persons” or “displaced persons,” uses of “personnel,” or broad population statistics that do not discuss personal-level issues. Edge cases include metadata mentions like “personal questionnaire” or single checklist items (e.g., “personal net income”) within a long, unrelated instrument; these are only weakly relevant unless the document substantively analyzes the personal dimension. Given the query’s breadth, prioritize documents where “personal” appears in titles/headings or repeatedly in core measures (e.g., personal data protection, personal trust/approval), and down-rank items where it is a minor attribute in an otherwise unrelated topic.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>Determine for each household member whether they have any personal income (yes/no) and, where available, record each person’s personal monthly/net income amount. Also capture the exact number of persons in the household, identify who contributes most to household income and their relationship to the respondent, and note related financial indicators (e.g., mortgage, overdraft, chequebook) if relevant.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "personal" when it explicitly concerns personal income or asks, for each household member, whether that person "has a personal income" — for example fields like hh1inca–hh8inca, "personal monthly net income," "Income Per person," or repeated questions "Do you personally have ...". Items that specify per-person income, who contributes most to household income, or country-specific personal income codes (e.g. FR RINC13, V202) are strongly relevant because they directly address individual-level financial status. Documents that focus on unrelated household attributes (number of people in the unit only), banking products (mortgage, overdraft, chequebook) or attitudinal questions about social mobility are non-relevant unless they explicitly link to an individual's personal income. Edge cases include instances where "personal" appears as a pronoun in other survey items ("Do you personally...") or as part of a product name — these are relevant only if the content concerns a respondent's own income or possessions; variable names and repeated noisy labels are useful metadata but do not change relevance unless they carry substantive personal-income information.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks social science survey resources centered on “personal” constructs and person-based classifications. This includes personality and personal norm/responsibility scales, questionnaires on personal behaviors (e.g., cancer screening, technophobia), and methodological guidance on web paradata and identifying chief income earners and cohabiting unions in the German Microcensus.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “personal” if it discusses individual-level attributes, behaviors, norms, or data, or explicitly contrasts personal versus non-personal information. In this paragraph, relevant content includes measures and questionnaires about personal cancer screening, personal ecological responsibility, personal norms for environmentally friendly behavior (global and traffic-specific), “personal failure” as a technophobia dimension, and domains like Personal Intelligence; the guideline on web paradata is also relevant where it distinguishes personal from non-personal paradata and addresses consent. By contrast, material focused on “person” or “persons” in a demographic sense (e.g., chief income earner, household reference person, advance letters to target persons, microcensus methodology) is non-relevant if it doesn’t address “personal” attributes or data. Edge cases include morphological or substring matches such as “personality” (relevant only if the discussion is about personal traits in a way that aligns with the query’s intent) and “non-personal” (may still be relevant when it helps define or contrast what counts as personal). Mentions where “personal” appears only incidentally or as part of unrelated administrative phrasing should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>

<title>alcohol</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an evidence-based overview of alcohol’s societal and public health impacts, focusing on how stigma, pricing/taxation and affordability, and policy measures relate to consumption patterns and harms. They also want findings on psychological and social determinants of drinking (e.g., adolescent and partner influences, identity, expectancy effects) and the effectiveness of interventions such as warnings, bans, and messaging, particularly in Europe.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it focuses on beverage alcohol (ethanol) and its consumption, harms, or regulation—such as studies on stigma toward heavy drinkers, affordability and taxation of beer/wine/spirits, BAC laws, adolescent drinking, intervention effectiveness (e.g., bans, warning labels, media campaigns), or outcomes like DALYs, aggression, and traffic fatalities. Empirical work on patterns by beverage type, social determinants (education, gender, occupation), and mechanisms (e.g., oxytocin, risk-taking) also counts, as do evaluations of Alcoholics Anonymous or historical temperance movements when tied to alcohol use and policy. Content is only partially relevant if alcohol appears tangentially—say, as one of several risk factors—or if the primary focus is general risk perception or self-esteem with minimal alcohol-specific analysis. Non-relevant items include uses of non-beverage alcohols (isopropyl, hand sanitizers), sugar alcohols, organic chemistry discussions of “alcohols,” or metaphorical uses of “spirits,” unless explicitly linked to drinking behavior or policy. Edge cases like methanol poisoning or lab tasks using alcohol as a stimulus are relevant when they address beverage alcohol harms or behavior change, but not when alcohol is merely a solvent or incidental material.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks survey-based information on alcohol use and attitudes, including consumption patterns, contexts, motives, perceived risks, and policy views, with demographic comparisons. It also covers related behaviors (smoking, drugs, drinking and driving) and health/social consequences, primarily in Germany and the EU across youth and adults.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “alcohol” when it addresses beverage alcohol (ethanol) use, attitudes, risks, or policies—such as drinking frequency, types of drinks (beer, wine, spirits/schnapps/liqueurs), binge episodes, age at first drink or intoxication, motives and contexts for drinking, price sensitivity, warnings, alcoholism/dependence, treatment, or driving under the influence and legal blood alcohol limits. The paragraph is highly relevant because it details surveys on Germans’ and youths’ alcohol consumption patterns, preferred beverages, comparisons to peers, reactions to non-alcoholic options, knowledge of alcoholics, perceived dangers, susceptibility, and policy views (e.g., under‑18 sales bans, advertising restrictions, and random police checks). Mixed-topic health or lifestyle datasets are also relevant if they include substantive alcohol variables (e.g., last-week quantities, household alcohol supply, frequency of 5+ drinks, DUI behavior or knowledge of legal limits). Non-relevant items are those where “alcohol” appears only tangentially or chemically (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, rubbing alcohol, ingredient lists) or materials focused solely on tobacco/drugs without meaningful alcohol measures. Edge cases include documents on non-alcoholic beverages, organ donation, or general health screening that qualify only if they contain specific alcohol consumption or attitude data; synonyms and related terms like intoxication, blood alcohol, alcoholism, dependency, and sobriety also indicate relevance.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A person searching "alcohol" here is looking for survey questions and measures about alcohol use, attitudes, policies, and stigma. Specifically they want items covering past-month drinking, support for warning labels on bottles and adverts, descriptions and social perceptions of alcoholics, self-reported drinking relative to others, safe-driving drink thresholds, alcohol at work, and age of first drink.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "alcohol" when it meaningfully discusses alcoholic beverages, drinking behaviour, policy or health issues — for example survey items asking "Did you drink any alcohol in the past four weeks?", items about warnings on bottles or adverts, age of first drink, or attitudes toward alcoholics. Concrete, specific content such as consumption frequency, number of drinks before not driving, policy support, or descriptions of alcoholics is highly relevant because it directly answers information needs about use, risk and public opinion. Edge cases depend on user intent: a chemistry paper about ethanol as a solvent or a safety data sheet for isopropyl alcohol is relevant for industrial or toxicology queries but less useful for public-health or social-survey queries about drinking. Non-relevant documents include ones that only contain "alcohol" incidentally (e.g., in a product name, email address, or a single passing mention) or use it metaphorically; such incidental mentions should be scored low unless the user’s intent is broad. In practice score relevance high when the document contains measures, attitudes, policies or outcomes related to drinking, moderate when the mention is tangential or technical, and low when the occurrence is incidental or ambiguous.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking information on alcohol addiction assessment tools, specifically biographical questionnaires that evaluate personality dimensions (e.g., neuroticism, socialization, goal orientation) and emphasize life‑history factors.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “alcohol” when it directly addresses alcohol use or misuse, such as addiction, assessment, treatment, health effects, policy, or consumption patterns. The provided paragraph is relevant because it focuses on a biographical questionnaire designed for alcohol addicts, detailing personality dimensions and its life-history focus—useful for research or clinical assessment of alcoholism. However, it would be non-relevant for intents about the chemistry of alcohols, beverage information, legal limits, or physiological effects, since it doesn’t discuss ethanol properties, drinking guidelines, or health outcomes. Examples of relevant content include diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder, validation of screening tools (e.g., AUDIT), or studies on therapy outcomes; non-relevant examples include generic personality inventories with no alcohol linkage or articles where “alcohol” appears only in a citation. Edge cases include psychometric tool development papers that use alcohol-dependent samples (still relevant if the tool targets alcoholism) versus chemistry texts using “alcohols” generically (irrelevant to the lay “alcohol” intent).</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks a scholarly overview of democracy, including its historical development, forms and theories (representative, direct, participatory, deliberative), conditions for emergence and stability, and ways to measure its quality and performance. They also want analyses of contemporary challenges—globalization, media, populism, religion and equality—and empirical evidence, especially for Germany and in comparative perspective (e.g., ALLBUS/WVS).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively examines democracy as a political concept, regime type, or practice—such as its history from antiquity to modernity, typologies (representative, plebiscitary, deliberative, participatory, direct), conditions of emergence and consolidation, measurement of its quality, or crises—with concrete analyses or data (e.g., ALLBUS, World Values Survey). Works that connect democracy to adjacent themes like globalization, media, equality and dignity, religion–state relations, populism, or transitions in Latin America and Eastern Europe, as well as case-focused discussions (e.g., direct democracy in German federalism), are also relevant. Normative or philosophical treatments (aphoristic defenses, radical or decolonial critiques, Tocqueville/Weber interpretations) qualify when democracy remains the central object of inquiry. Non-relevant items merely name-drop “Demokratie,” use it metaphorically, or focus primarily on unrelated methods or economics where democracy is incidental. Edge cases include German compounds and adjectival forms (Demokratietheorie, Postdemokratie, demokratisch), which should count, whereas occurrences confined to titles, publisher names, or brief mentions without substantive discussion should not.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks survey datasets and studies on democracy—primarily in Germany—covering evaluations of democratic performance, party preferences, institutional trust, populist attitudes, EU integration, and civic participation, with rich demographic detail. The resources span public and elite samples and include cross-national modules (e.g., CSES) to analyze attitudes and voting behavior over time.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively treats democracy (Demokratie) as a system or value—examining satisfaction with democracy, democratic principles and rights, institutional trust, the functioning of the political system, or citizens’/elites’ attitudes toward it. Examples include surveys assessing the Grundgesetz, links between democracy and the social market economy, preferences for representative versus direct democracy, fears and threats to democracy, EU integration and federalism as they affect democratic governance, or how populism shapes attitudes and voting in democracies. Documents are non-relevant if they only name-check “Demokratie,” list demographics without connecting them to democratic attitudes, or focus on unrelated topics (e.g., pure economics, lifestyle, or sports) with no democracy analysis. Edge cases include multi-topic datasets where democracy is one module—these are relevant if that module is substantive; historical comparisons (Weimar, Nationalsozialismus) or party preference data are relevant only when tied to democratic norms, performance, or satisfaction. German compounds such as Demokratiezufriedenheit qualify, and cross-national studies of “new democracies” or elite interviews are relevant when they analyze implications for democratic development, quality, or behavior.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for survey items and variable labels measuring "Demokratiezufriedenheit" — i.e., public satisfaction with democracy in Germany — and responses about the current state and future of democracy in Turkey under President Erdoğan. They likely need the exact question wording, associated variable IDs (e.g., V110, V146, V211), or the survey data to analyze public attitudes toward democracy in both countries.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "demokratie" if it explicitly discusses democracy (Demokratie) in the sense of public attitudes, satisfaction or survey questions — for example texts that ask "Wie zufrieden oder unzufrieden sind Sie ... mit der Demokratie in Deutschland" or probe "Was meinen Sie zur Zukunft der Demokratie in der Türkei / unter Präsident Erdogan." Entries that contain the questionnaire wording, response options, or variable labels (e.g. V110, V211, DEMOKRATIEZUFRIEDENHEIT) are highly relevant because they directly match the intent to find measures of democracy satisfaction. Non-relevant documents mention "democracy" only peripherally (a single passing reference), use a different sense of the term (metaphorically), or focus exclusively on legal theory, history, or policy without measuring attitudes. Edge cases include repeated or uppercase variable lists (duplication or formatting noise still relevant if the survey question text is present) and files that contain only variable codes without the question wording (these are less useful). Documents in German about Germany or Turkey are particularly pertinent, while sources in unrelated languages or about other countries may be only partially relevant.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks information on a study of how Germans conceive of democracy and what determines their preferences for democratic decision-making procedures. It examines attitudes toward majority rule versus minority protection, direct democracy, and the role of national pride in democratic stability.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “demokratie” if it substantively discusses democracy as a political system or idea—for example, theories or conceptions of democracy, public preferences over democratic procedures, trade-offs like majority rule versus minority rights, or instruments such as direct democracy. Empirical studies about attitudes toward democracy in Germany, including survey designs, pretests, and methods (e.g., web probing) are relevant when they are applied to democratic topics, as in research on how citizens weigh procedures. Content linking adjacent themes—such as how national pride might affect democratic stability, system acceptance, or civic cohesion—is also relevant when the connection to democracy is explicit. By contrast, pages that only mention “Demokratie” in passing (e.g., a slogan, a footer link, or a bibliography entry), or that use it solely in proper names (e.g., “Demokratische Republik Kongo”) without discussing democratic governance, are not relevant. Edge cases include methodological texts: if they describe survey methods with no democratic substance, they are non-relevant; if those methods are used to probe democratic attitudes or procedures, they are relevant.</narr>

They are interested in how culture intersects with media, politics, economy, gender, globalization, and key debates such as the Snow–Leavis “two cultures” controversy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it centrally examines Kultur as a concept or domain, for example by defining it, tracing its etymology, or theorizing it in sociology or cultural studies (e.g., classical vs. postclassical culture theory, culture as communication, culture’s role in integration or disintegration). Analyses of specific arenas such as the Snow–Leavis “two cultures” debate, political culture, culture and gender around 1800/1900, globalization and media, or the culture and creative industries also count as relevant, as do substantive discussions of compound notions like Unternehmenskultur, Streitkultur, or interkulturelle Kommunikation. Documents that merely mention the word in passing, list it only in bibliographic titles without treatment, or use “Kultur” in unrelated senses (e.g., microbial/bacterial cultures or horticulture) are non-relevant. Edge cases include table-of-contents style overviews: they are relevant if the items demonstrably engage Kultur (e.g., Marcuse on Eros and culture, Sennett on the culture of capitalism), but not if “Kultur” appears only as a buzzword. Variants and plurals (Kulturen) or closely related German compounds are relevant when the surrounding text clearly analyzes cultural meanings, practices, or values rather than using the term as a label.</narr>

<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking research datasets and survey information about culture and cultural participation. Topics span Sorbian culture in Lusatia and comparative public-opinion studies on cultural values, EU relations and cooperation, institutional trust, immigration and prejudice, media use, and related demographics.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “kultur” if it substantively discusses culture, such as customs, festivals, language use, cultural policy, arts participation, heritage, or cultural institutions. Examples include material on Sorbian customs and language in Lusatia, attendance at theaters or cinemas, preferred venues for cultural events, EU-related cultural exchange, or analyses of “political culture” and “kulturelle Werte.” Statistical surveys or datasets are also relevant when they contain dedicated sections on culture and the arts (e.g., cultural activities, media habits, institutions, funding, or attitudes toward culture), even if embedded among broader topics. A document is non-relevant when “kultur” appears only incidentally or in an unrelated sense (e.g., biological cultures, agriculture, or a passing mention in a list where culture is not treated in depth). Edge cases to include as relevant are German compounds and variants like Kulturveranstaltungen, kulturell, Kultur und Kunst, and politische Kultur, as well as English or other-language equivalents of “culture.”</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>The query asks about "culture" in a survey context — primarily which international organization handles culture and science (e.g., UNESCO) and about common survey items measuring public attitudes toward cultural diversity, minority lifestyles, and COVID-related closures of cultural and leisure venues. The user likely wants a concise identification of the relevant organization(s) and example survey questions or response options.</desc>
	<narr>This document is highly relevant to the keyword "kultur" because it repeatedly uses the German term and contains many items explicitly about culture (e.g., "Welche der folgenden internationalen Organisationen beschäftigt sich mit Kultur und Wissenschaft" and references to "Kulturen", "Lebensweisen" and "Kultur und Freizeiteinrichtungen"). Concrete examples that increase relevance are the survey questions about different lifestyles, religions and cultures in Germany and the item asking which international organization deals with culture and science (an implicit reference to bodies like UNESCO). Some parts are noisy or metadata (pk14, V745, to03) and there is heavy repetition, which reduces usefulness but not topicality. Possible edge cases that would make this document less relevant: a user seeking in-depth cultural analysis or policy rather than survey items, or a case where "Kultur" appears only incidentally as part of COVID-19 closure notices. Overall it is topically relevant for queries about "kultur," but you should verify whether you want organizational information, public opinion survey content, or cleaned text without repeated template markers.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks information on culture-related constructs and validated measurement tools—acculturation orientations of migrants, attitudes toward outgroups, motivations for intergroup contact, and value scales. They also need methodological guidance for cross-cultural survey research, including defining household size and standardizing/harmonizing socio-demographic variables for comparability.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “kultur” when it directly addresses culture or acculturation—such as intercultural contact, heritage vs host culture (Herkunftskultur/Aufnahmekultur), intergroup attitudes toward foreign cultures, or values framed as the basis of any culture. Concrete matches include scales like AKOrM (adapted from the Vancouver Index of Acculturation), inventories measuring motives for contact with people from other cultures, IRV value measures that situate values within cultural frameworks, and discussions of harmonizing survey variables across different cultures or how household definitions vary between cultures. Content is non-relevant when “Kultur” appears only incidentally (e.g., in a ministry’s name) or in sections unrelated to cultural themes (e.g., mathematical modeling self-efficacy) unless explicitly tied to cultural context; purely technical psychometric details without a cultural lens also reduce relevance. Edge cases include compound or inflected forms (Kulturen, interkulturell, Herkunftskultur) which are strong positives, versus uses of “culture” in non-social senses (e.g., laboratory cultures) that are false positives. Generic discussions of demographic standardization are only tangential unless they explicitly address cross-cultural comparability.</narr>

<title>konsum</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The query seeks comprehensive, German-language research on consumption (Konsum) from sociological, economic, and policy perspectives. It spans local and sustainable consumption, consumption’s role in identity and recognition, governance and historical transitions (e.g., Soviet/DDR), demographic effects on demand, and empirical monitoring of psychoactive substance use.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it centrally addresses consumption (Konsum) as behavior, practice, or concept—whether socio-cultural, economic, political, or public-health related. Examples include analyses of locally oriented consumption among multi-local households, discussions of sustainable consumption in food (e.g., organic purchases and consumption biographies), prevalence studies of substance use (“Konsum von Alkohol/Cannabis”), theoretical work on recognition, governmentality and the politics of consumer society, or economic/demographic studies of household consumption by purpose. Historical and institutional perspectives—such as DDR consumer shortages, debates over “richtiger/falscher Konsum,” or educational programs for sustainable consumption—also count, as do operational measures like expenditures or prevalence rates. Non-relevant items are those where “Konsum” appears only tangentially (e.g., in passing or metadata), as a proper noun or brand without discussing consumer practices, or as a homograph/near miss unrelated to consumption. Edge cases: compound and variant forms (Konsums, konsumieren, Konsumgesellschaft, Nichtkonsum), domains like media consumption and large local investments, and drug-use contexts are relevant; documents where consumption is a minor aside should be deprioritized.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking resources on “Konsum” (consumption) in Germany, including datasets and studies on historical private income/consumption time series, consumer and media behavior, and substance use (alcohol, tobacco, drugs, medications). They also want research on sustainable consumption (SDG 12) and micro-level analyses such as household Christmas spending.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it contains the German term “Konsum” or clear compounds and inflections that include it, such as privater Konsum (macro consumption), Konsumverhalten, Alkoholkonsum, Tabakkonsum, Drogenkonsum, or nachhaltiger Konsum, especially when providing measures, time series, surveys, or analyses (e.g., private consumption indices 1851–1913 or CATI surveys on SDG 12 consumer behavior). Studies on consumer lifestyles, brand consciousness, media consumption, or household expenditure that explicitly use “Konsum-” compounds also match the query. Documents are non-relevant if they discuss adjacent topics (income, health, or media use) without mentioning “Konsum,” or if they only use synonyms like Verbrauch/Verbraucherverhalten without the keyword. Edge cases include “Konsum” as a proper noun (retail co-ops like Konsum Leipzig), archaic or variant forms (Konsumtion/Consum), or hits limited to metadata or classification codes; these may be marginally relevant depending on the search’s literal vs. semantic intent.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for measures and survey questions about consumption and media use, including frequency of reading local, regional and national newspapers (and specific titles), watching news on public or private TV, and membership/knowledge of consumer associations and their magazines. They also want questions about personal consumption habits (wine, meat, various foods and drinks) and smoking frequency.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant for the query "konsum" when it directly addresses consumption behavior or consumer topics — for example survey items asking how often people read local or national newspapers, whether they drink wine, eat meat, or smoke, or questions about consumer associations and magazines. The paragraph you provided contains many clearly relevant elements: frequency-of-use questions (e.g., "An wievielen Tagen … gelesen"), dietary frequency lists ("Essen Sie Fleisch", repeated item lists), and explicit consumer‑association prompts, all of which are central to consumption research. Documents that are non‑relevant mention "Konsum" only tangentially (e.g., as part of a company name or filename), discuss production/supply issues rather than end‑user consumption, or contain only survey metadata and response codes (KA, TNZ, wave notes) without behavioral content. Edge cases include ambiguous intent (if the user meant economic consumption vs. media/food consumption), documents that only include a single occurrence of the term in a header, or materials in a different language — these may be borderline relevant depending on whether the user needs raw survey items, coded data, or high‑level analysis. Prioritize texts with explicit frequency measures, question wording, or lists of consumer goods when matching for "konsum."</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks a concise explanation of consumer ethnocentrism — the belief that domestic products are superior to foreign ones — and how it is measured (the 15‑item short and 20‑item long CETSCALE). They want the theoretical background (Jacoby 1978) and the kinds of economic, social and moral beliefs the scale captures, such as the idea that buying foreign goods harms the domestic economy and increases unemployment.</desc>
	<narr>This document is relevant to the query "konsum" because it directly describes consumers' beliefs about buying domestic versus foreign products and presents a 15- or 20-item scale measuring consumer ethnocentrism — a core aspect of consumption behavior. It is useful when the interest is in consumer attitudes, measurement instruments, references (e.g., Jacoby 1978), and how economic, social, and moral considerations shape purchase decisions (for example, shoppers who avoid imports to protect local jobs). It would be non-relevant if the query intends a different sense of "konsum" (such as medical drug consumption, substance use, or macro-level production statistics) or if a document only mentions the term without discussing consumer behavior. Borderline cases include papers on nationalism or trade policy that touch on consumer ethnocentrism (partially relevant) and highly technical psychometric reports that describe the scale structure but provide no context about actual purchasing behavior (less relevant).</narr>

<title>social media</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking scholarly analyses of how social media operates as a socio-technical system shaping news production, agenda setting, policy, trust, social cohesion, relationships, health behaviors, and organizational strategies. They want evidence-based insights into mechanisms like commodification, engagement, media literacy, and platform logic across diverse contexts and case studies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “social media” when it primarily examines social media platforms, practices, or effects—for example, studies of Facebook/Twitter agenda setting, newsroom use and commodification of social media, disaster communication via social platforms, social cohesion impacts, or policy influence sparked by trending topics. Theoretical or methodological work that analyzes “social media logic,” datafication, platform-specific engagement, or sectoral uses (museums’ Facebook/Twitter strategies, sports marketing on social networks, adolescent sexual risk on Instagram/Snapchat) is also relevant, even if it uses terms like “social networking sites” or refers only to platform names. Regional case studies (e.g., Indonesia, Pakistan, Lebanon) and cross-media comparisons that explicitly include social media metrics, exposure, or posting behavior likewise count. Non-relevant items are those that mention social media only in passing, focus solely on legacy media without a social component, use “social networks” to mean offline interpersonal networks, or discuss “media” generically without digital social platforms. Edge cases include historical or “social movement media” analyses that mix offline and online channels (partially relevant if they analyze digital platforms) and media literacy/trust studies that are relevant only when they explicitly measure or theorize social media use rather than general media consumption.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking empirical studies and datasets on social media use—its frequency, platforms, purposes, and user attitudes—and its societal and political impacts. Focus areas include language and identity, political information behavior, hate speech and disinformation, media trust, and social cohesion, primarily in Germany with some cross-national comparisons, including details on methods and demographics.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “social media” when it substantially discusses social networking platforms, their use, behaviors, impacts, or policies—for example, surveys of intensive social media users, frequency of use of Facebook/Instagram/Twitter/YouTube/WhatsApp, political information behavior on social networks, hate speech, regulation, or social media strategies and follower analytics for blogs/podcasts. Content on scientists’ use of Web 2.0 tools (e.g., Twitter, wikis, Mendeley, Zotero), learning with social networks in education, or studies like ValCon examining digital social news media and polarization is also clearly relevant. Material becomes only weakly relevant if it treats “media” broadly but still analyzes disinformation, credibility, or political engagement specifically on social platforms; it is non-relevant when limited to traditional media (radio/TV/print) without a connection to social networks, such as GDR-era media habits or Yugoslav broadcast coverage. Edge cases include using synonyms like “social networks” instead of “social media,” counting specific platform names even without the term “social media,” and excluding methodological terms like “online interviews/CAWI,” which are not topical. Overall, this paragraph is highly relevant because it repeatedly and explicitly covers social media use across populations and contexts, though some historical/traditional-media sections are outside scope.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A person wants to know whether people follow public debates on social media (e.g., reading articles, online networks or blogs) and how they would respond if their social media or email account were hacked — specifically who they would contact (police, provider, consumer organisation, website, or no one). They may also be asking for opinions on how radio/TV/newspapers report poverty and social exclusion.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly discusses following debates on social media — for example articles, threads or blog posts about online debates, platform-specific discussions (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit), or survey items that ask “Do you follow debates on social media?” It is also relevant when it addresses social media accounts specifically in a cybercrime context (e.g., “your social media or email account being hacked”) because that ties the security issue to social platforms. Non-relevant documents focus on other topics even if they reuse similar words — for instance pieces about poverty in the media that never mention social networks, general cybercrime guidance about banking/passwords without reference to social accounts, or raw survey metadata and question codes with no substantive social-media content. Edge cases include texts that mention “social” in other senses (social services, social policy) or only list “social media” in metadata or a long enumeration; those may be false positives unless the main content actually discusses online networks, blogs, or social-account issues. As a rule, require explicit mention of social networks, online debates, blogs, or social-account hacking to mark a document relevant.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks expert, research-based guidance on social media within computational social science. They want methods and ethical insights for analyzing text and images, collecting and linking web/mobile behavioral data, and addressing misinformation, fairness, vulnerable communities, and impacts on democracy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly examines social media platforms, behaviors, data, or effects—for example, interviews about detecting misinformation on social platforms, analyses of visual content in political online communication, linking survey responses to social media traces, or reviews of social media’s impact on democracy. Guides or methods (e.g., web tracking, mobile data collection) are relevant when they are applied to studying social media use or extracting social media content, but are peripheral if they focus on general online behavior without a platform link. Content about vulnerable communities’ online communications or information quality is relevant when it analyzes their activity on social platforms. By contrast, sections centered on psychometric scales and questionnaires about social policy, workplace stress, social trust, or left-right ideology without a social media component are non-relevant. Edge cases include “media-based empathy” or algorithmic fairness pieces: they qualify only if they specify social media contexts or datasets, not if they discuss media or socio-technical systems in the abstract.</narr>

<title>jugendliche</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking comprehensive academic research on adolescents, especially those with migration backgrounds, in Germany and related contexts. They want empirical and longitudinal studies covering integration, school-to-work transitions, social and family relations, leisure, multilingualism, and the effects of youth and labor-market policies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it primarily studies or targets adolescents/youth (e.g., school-age cohorts or young people in transition to work), explicitly labeling them as “Jugendliche” and presenting age-defined data, samples, or interventions. For example, surveys of 10th graders in NRW, longitudinal panels on Turkish-origin and Aussiedler youth, analyses of gymnasium participation in the Mikrozensus, or studies of transitions in the DJI Übergangspanel are clearly relevant; even focused topics like hairstyle preferences among 14–26-year-olds or youth leisure/violence/drug attitudes qualify when adolescents are the main unit of analysis. A document is non-relevant if it discusses general population policies without youth-specific findings, uses “jugendlich” only as a stylistic adjective (e.g., “youthful style”), or mentions adolescents only in passing without data or conclusions about them. Edge cases include mixed-age samples where adolescents are one subgroup (relevant if substantive subgroup results are reported), studies of “young adults” stretching to mid-20s (relevant if adolescent-range data are included), or historical/DDR contexts that still analyze youth behavior or perceptions. Clear age ranges, school grades (e.g., 7th, 10th), or labels like SGB II youth, migrant-background youth associations, and panel designs strengthen relevance; vague references to “youth” without defined samples or outcomes weaken it.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking comprehensive research data and surveys on adolescents in Germany, spanning sexuality, wellbeing, media/social media use, migration and integration, leisure, substance use, violence, legal status, political attitudes, and educational outcomes. They also want details on samples, methods, and time frames across these studies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it centers on adolescents (Jugendliche) as the subject, uses the exact term or close synonyms (Kinder und Jugendliche, Teenager, Heranwachsende, junge Menschen), and/or specifies youth age bands such as 12–19, 14–17, or 14–18. Clear examples include surveys of youth sexuality (14–17), wellbeing studies of 7th/9th graders, media-use research on 12–19-year-olds, datasets on the living situation of foreign youths, or legal/statistical tables that explicitly break out categories labeled “Jugendliche.” Documents are non-relevant if “jugendliche” appears only incidentally while the main focus is adults or the general population, if it is purely historical/legal background without youth-focused analysis, or if the adjective is used in unrelated senses (e.g., jugendliche Mode, Jugendstil). Edge cases include materials on “junge Erwachsene” (18–25) or “Heranwachsende” (18–21), which are only relevant when adolescents are included or compared, and parent-focused content that remains relevant if it reports outcomes or behaviors of the youths themselves. Morphological variants (Jugendlicher, Jugendlichen) and compounds (Kinder und Jugendliche, Jugendzentrum) can also indicate relevance when the content concerns adolescents’ experiences, services, or measurements.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants survey questions and public‑opinion information about adolescents in Germany. Specifically they are looking for items on youth violence and fear, the impact of banning violent video games, causes and blame for youth unemployment, recent youth riots (including immigrant youth), reports of sexual abuse in church institutions, household counts of 14–19‑year‑olds, and whether unions or government protect youth interests.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "jugendliche" when it explicitly addresses young people or adolescent-specific issues — for example survey questions or statistics about juvenile violence, jugendarbeitslosigkeit (youth unemployment), age brackets like 14–16 or 17–19, sexual abuse of children and adolescents, the effects of banning violent computer games on youth, or public attitudes toward riots by young people. It is non‑relevant when the text treats crime, employment, or policy in purely general terms without an age focus, or when the word "jugendliche" appears only as a stray metadata tag, a place name, or part of an unrelated compound (e.g., "Jugendherberge") that does not concern adolescents. Edge cases include documents that discuss topics such as video‑game regulation or public order: these are relevant only if they explicitly link the issue to youth behaviour or youth policy, otherwise they may be false positives. Survey instruments and question lists (raw questionnaire items) are relevant even if they are repetitive or noisy, because they show what was asked about adolescents; by contrast, documents about adults or population totals that lack age‑specific breakdowns should be treated as non‑relevant. Finally, language differences (German vs. translated text) do not change relevance if the content clearly pertains to young people.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks an overview of validated German-language questionnaires and short psychometric scales for children and adolescents across diverse constructs (e.g., family climate, delinquency, identity, physical activity, growth mindset, self-efficacy, personality, empathy, need for cognition, impostor), including item content, subscales, translations, and evidence of reliability, validity, and cognitive pretesting.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it centers on adolescents (Jugendliche) as the target group—typically ages ~10–19—and explicitly discusses their behaviors, traits, attitudes, or measurement instruments (e.g., scales on delinquency, family climate, identity, physical activity, growth mindset, self-efficacy, Big Five youth versions, authoritarian attitudes, media-based empathy, Need for Cognition Teens, or impostor self-concept). Studies and pretests using adolescent samples, including German-language tools or translations (e.g., Turkish/Arabic for Muslim adolescents in Germany), are highly relevant. A document is non-relevant if it focuses exclusively on adults or only on younger children, or if “jugendliche” appears only tangentially (such as marketing phrases like “jugendliche Haut” or stylistic uses) without substantive youth content. Edge cases: materials covering “Kinder und Jugendliche” are relevant if adolescents are a substantial subgroup or results are reported for them; work on “young adults” is relevant only if it includes or directly compares adolescent samples. Legal, historical, or theoretical mentions of “Jugendliche” without empirical or topical focus on adolescent populations are generally less relevant.</narr>

<title>religiosität</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking sociological research on religiosity—its definitions, dimensions, and measurement (e.g., via ALLBUS)—including distinctions between Christian and alternative/spiritual forms and their development over time in Germany and Europe. They also want evidence on how religiosity relates to demographics and social outcomes such as morality, fertility, gender-role attitudes, antisemitism, youth spirituality, and well-being.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly analyzes, defines, measures, or explains patterns, drivers, or outcomes of religiosity (Religiosität), including individual or group religiosity across traditions (e.g., Christian, Islamic, “alternative”/spiritual) and life stages. Strong signals include empirical work using surveys like ALLBUS, EVS, or ISSP; factor analyses of dimensions (e.g., mysticism, magic, health practices, Huber’s centrality/Z-scale); and studies linking religiosity to topics such as fertility, gender-role values, antisemitism, well-being, or East/West differences. Items are non-relevant if they only mention the term in passing, focus solely on church institutions or theology without addressing religiosity as a construct, or discuss “religion” generically without measurement, conceptualization, or behavioral/attitudinal indicators. Edge cases counted as relevant include work using near-synonyms (Spiritualität, Kirchlichkeit, Glaube) when tied to religiosity constructs, subgroup analyses (e.g., youth, Muslim minorities, clergy), methodological papers on measuring religiosity, and trend studies on secularization that quantify religiosity. Conversely, pieces about religious history, liturgy, or culture with no treatment of religiosity levels, dimensions, or correlates—even if the word appears—should be considered non-relevant.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks studies and survey data on religiosity—beliefs, practices, and self-assessed spirituality—and how it relates to attitudes toward death, politics, socialization, and demographics. It points to German (and some comparative, e.g., Cologne–Tokyo) datasets across students, youth, and the general population.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly treats religiosity as a topic or measure, such as reporting church attendance, frequency of prayer or Bible reading, self-rated religiosity, belief in God or an afterlife, spiritual feelings, or the importance of following religious rules. It is also relevant when religiosity appears as a demographic or scale within broader surveys of politics or society, provided it is actually measured or analyzed—for example, items on Kirchgangshäufigkeit, Beten, Freitagsgebet, adherence to Islamic prescriptions, belief in angels/demons, astrology, or readiness to proselytize. Documents that only mention “Religiosität” in passing (e.g., a lone variable name in a long list) without describing content, methods, or findings are weakly relevant, while pieces focused solely on unrelated topics like housing or party preferences with no religious measures are non-relevant. Edge cases include spelling/umlaut variants (Religiositaet), synonyms like spirituality, or constructs like “thinking about religion” or “divine messages,” which can still qualify; by contrast, texts that reference churches or clergy historically but never address personal religiosity as a trait or practice may not satisfy the query. German-language sections that enumerate detailed religiosity batteries (e.g., frequency of thinking about religion, feelings of divine intervention, or missionizing readiness) strongly match the intent of the query.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>The user wants to know the father's religious affiliation when the respondent was about 11–12 years old. This information is sought to measure parental religiosity during the respondent’s childhood.</desc>
	<narr>This document is relevant to the keyword "religiosität" because it explicitly asks about parental religiosity — using terms like "Religiosität," "Konfession," "Religionsgemeinschaft" and a concrete survey item about which religious community the respondent’s father belonged to when the respondent was 11 or 12. It is especially useful for people interested in measurement of religiosity in surveys, historical/age-specific affiliation, or variable coding (note the item code V322). Documents that merely mention religion in passing, discuss theology or spirituality in a philosophical sense, or focus on unrelated family members without addressing parental affiliation would be non-relevant. Edge cases include items that only ask about the mother (partially relevant if the searcher accepts parent-level data), or instruments that discuss church attendance or belief without specifying "Konfession" — those may be relevant for broader notions of religiosity but not for questions about denominational affiliation. Duplicate or noisy text (repeated lines) is still relevant if the substantive question and keywords are present, but should be de-duplicated for clarity.</narr>

	<desc>The user is looking for a German-language measure of religiosity—the Religious Commitment Scale—and its five items for use in clinical research. They also seek related measures of parental behavior (supportive care and religious socialization) to examine links to norms, values, and in-/out-group orientations.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly addresses Religiosität (religiosity) as an attitude or commitment toward religion and its institutions, especially if it discusses measurement (e.g., the Religious Commitment Scale), dimensions of religious commitment, or links religiosity to socio-cultural norms and ingroup orientations. Content describing a German version of such a scale, clinical or psychological research on religiosity, or parental socialization dimensions related to religious upbringing (e.g., “Erziehung zur Religion”) is highly relevant. Documents that only mention general parenting warmth without connecting it to parental religiosity, or that discuss religion theologically without addressing individual religiosity/commitment or its assessment, are less relevant. Edge cases include papers that use religiosity merely as a control variable, texts focusing on “spirituality” without explicit religiosity measures, or mentions of religiosity limited to citations—these would be only marginally or non-relevant unless they provide substantive, measurable treatment of religiosity.</narr>

<title>karriere</title>
<publication>
	<desc>Find scholarly analyses of the concept of career and career success, including subjective vs. objective dimensions and the influence of gender, dual-career partnerships, and international mobility (expatriates/flexpatriates). Emphasis is on academic and NPO contexts, work–life balance, and institutional factors shaping career trajectories.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively treats “Karriere” (career) as the main topic—defining it, measuring career success, mapping career paths, or analyzing determinants—such as studies on expatriates/flexpatriates, dual‑career couples, women in science, or careers in specific fields (e.g., chemistry, theology, engineering) and sectors (e.g., NPOs). It remains relevant when the concept appears via variants and related terms (Karrieren, Doppelkarriere, Karrierefrau, berufliche Laufbahn), includes empirical comparisons or regional differences, or uses theoretical frames (e.g., Bourdieu’s field/habitus) to explain career trajectories. Documents are non‑relevant if “Karriere” is only a passing or metaphorical mention (e.g., the “career” of terrorists or of a concept), confined to metadata, or if the focus is unrelated to occupational/academic careers. Edge cases include historical handbooks that chart stages of careers (relevant), critiques of gendered career discourse and work–life tensions (relevant), and pieces where “Dual Career” appears in English within German text (still relevant). Texts that omit the word “Karriere” but clearly discuss career processes via synonyms like Laufbahn or beruflicher Aufstieg can also be judged relevant.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking comprehensive information and datasets on career development and trajectories in Germany—especially academic careers but also other professions—covering stages of advancement, education, exams, employment, social origin, gender, and work–life balance from historical to contemporary periods. The goal is to understand determinants of career progression, mobility, and outcomes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it uses “Karriere” in the sense of professional or academic career paths, stages, determinants, or outcomes—for example, handbooks on academic careers in Prussia/Germany (1850–1945) describing Karrierestufen like study duration, exams, promotions/habilitation/professorships, surveys on work and career (career goals, mobility, job market), or studies of journalists’ and politicians’ career trajectories. Mentions via compounds and synonyms (beruflicher Werdegang, Laufbahn, Karrierechancen, Karrierebedingungen) and operational indicators (appointments, tenure, publications, mentoring, labor market status) also make it relevant, including analyses of family–career balance or discrimination affecting careers. It is non-relevant when “karriere” appears only as a navigation label, boilerplate, a brand/name, or a passing mention without describing career development, or when used metaphorically unrelated to employment. Edge cases like content about sacrificing or interrupting a career, historical lists of promotions and professorships, or evaluation of journals’ impact on reputation and career remain relevant because they analyze career conditions and outcomes. Conversely, pages that merely enumerate unrelated topics where “karriere” occurs once without context, or contain only administrative metadata, would be non-relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The query "karriere" (German for "career") indicates a need for information about building or advancing a professional life—such as career paths, job opportunities, required qualifications and skills, CV/interview advice, or company career pages. The user likely wants guidance on starting, changing, or progressing a career and finding relevant openings.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "karriere" if it clearly focuses on careers, career development, job opportunities, CV/interview advice, or pathways within professions — for example, a German-language guide to switching careers, a company’s careers page, or a list of job openings. Because "karriere" is German, pages written in German or aimed at German-speaking jobseekers are usually more relevant; English pages about "career" can still be useful but may not match the user’s language intent. Non-relevant documents merely mentioning the word in passing, using it as a surname or brand name, or containing it only in unrelated lists are not helpful. Edge cases include pages where the term appears only inside large aggregated content (e.g., a long forum thread) or outdated job postings that no longer apply; these may require extra weighting or freshness checks. Signals that increase relevance include the term appearing in titles, headings, meta tags, structured job data, and in-depth, actionable content; weak signals are single occurrences, poor translations, or pages that focus on adjacent topics like general business news without career-specific information.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "karriere" if it deals with career orientation, career-related attitudes or measures—especially questionnaires and psychometric items that capture self-perceived, performance-related behaviors and fears (for example studies validating a career-orientation scale or vocational counseling instruments that assess fear of failure). Relevant examples include research on career orientation, instruments measuring success‑oriented work attitudes, and surveys that ask respondents to reflect on their career‑related behaviors and anxieties. Documents are non-relevant if they only use "karriere" in passing, discuss unrelated topics (e.g., product career metaphors, purely technical performance metrics), or focus on general personality constructs without any career context. Edge cases include papers that address fear of failure or work attitudes but not explicitly in a career context (partially relevant), documents in other languages or using synonyms like "Beruf" or "career" which should be matched by translation, and psychometric studies that are relevant only if their items explicitly target career constructs rather than broad self‑esteem.</narr>

	<desc>The query seeks research-based insights on job quality and security—how job satisfaction, job fit, and specific job attributes (e.g., security, autonomy, pay) affect well-being, performance, mobility, and turnover across countries. It also looks for evidence on gender/cultural differences and policy levers such as employer job security guarantees and regulations.</desc>
	<narr>Because the query is the single word “job,” the most relevant documents are those primarily about employment positions and labor-market topics—such as job quality, job security, job satisfaction, job mobility, hiring/quitting, and workplace outcomes or policies. Items like studies on job insecurity and satisfaction, job guarantees, graduate jobs classifications, refugees’ job quality, supervisory roles and satisfaction, and cross-country analyses of job attributes are highly relevant; documents using close synonyms (employment, work, occupation, position, role) also qualify if the focus is clearly on employment. A document can still be relevant even if the word “job” appears infrequently, provided its core analysis concerns employment outcomes or job design; conversely, texts that only mention “job” in passing while focusing on unrelated themes are weak matches. Non-relevant uses include “Job” as a proper noun (the biblical figure), surnames (e.g., “Jobs”), technical/computing senses (print/cron jobs, task schedulers), media titles (e.g., “The Italian Job”), or slang where employment is not the topic. Edge cases include education or skills research that is relevant if it explicitly links to employment outcomes (e.g., graduate jobs, on-the-job training), but general well-being or organizational topics with no employment linkage would not be.</narr>

<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks comprehensive survey data on employment and job market conditions—types of employment, working hours, income/taxes/social security, side jobs, and unemployment. They also want evidence on job-related mobility (commuting, travel, relocations) and its causes and impacts on well-being, family life, career progression, job satisfaction/stress, union attitudes, automation, and gender equality, with demographic breakdowns.</desc>
	<narr>For the query “job,” a document is relevant when it primarily addresses employment and work-related themes such as employment status, job mobility, working hours, pay/benefits, job search and unemployment, job satisfaction, and workplace conditions. Examples include surveys detailing side jobs and their taxation, commuting or overnight travel for work and relocations made for job reasons, occupational histories and promotions, union membership and works council issues, or sector-specific job markets (e.g., journalists). Content about job-creation programs and retraining, temporary or part-time contracts (including rules like “50 days or 2 months per year”), the effects of automation on job stress, or variables like gross income from a primary job and social-security contributions also matches. Documents are non-relevant if “job” appears only incidentally or in another sense (e.g., the biblical Job or computing batch jobs), or if the focus is on unrelated domains (family, religion, health) without substantive links to employment. Edge cases include broad social surveys: they remain relevant when they contain substantial employment modules (even if mixed with other topics) and when they use near-synonyms such as occupation, work, or employment; however, pieces that mention jobs only in passing within a long list of unrelated variables may be borderline.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>Collect detailed employment information about a person's first job after leaving full‑time education and their current (or most recent) job. This includes job type, full‑time/part‑time status, second jobs, reasons for temporary or part‑time work, skill requirements, job duration/number, and the job’s status compared with the respondent’s father.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "job" when it contains substantive content about employment — for example survey questions asking which type of job a respondent had in their first job after leaving full‑time education, what their current or last job is, whether it is full‑ or part‑time, reasons for temporary or part‑time work, second jobs, job skills, or comparisons of job status with a parent. Conversely, a document is non‑relevant when it only mentions the word “job” in passing or in a different sense (e.g., “do the job,” computing batch jobs), or when it only contains unrelated material such as political performance questions or lists of variable codes without the accompanying questionnaire text. Edge cases include files that contain variable codes (v71, v72, Q23a, etc.) or repeated boilerplate: these may be borderline relevant if the actual question text about occupations is present, but less useful if they only show metadata or duplicates. Prioritize documents with clear survey items about occupation, employment status, duration, preferences, and reasons; deprioritize those that lack employment content or use “job” ambiguously.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking guidance on how to capture and code job-related data in surveys. They want validated measures for job satisfaction/employee experience and transparency, plus procedures, software, and classification schemes (KldB 2010, ISCO-08) to code occupations and derive status/prestige indices like ISEI, SIOPS, and ISEC.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “job” if it discusses employment or occupations in a substantive way, such as measuring job satisfaction or employee experience, describing occupational classifications (e.g., ISCO-08, KldB 2010), or explaining how job-related data are coded and used in analyses (ISEI, SIOPS, ISEC). For example, studies presenting psychometric scales of job satisfaction or engagement, or guides to coding job titles into standardized occupation categories, directly answer the query’s intent. It may also be relevant when adjacent constructs (like organizational transparency) are empirically linked to job satisfaction or workplace outcomes. Non-relevant uses include “Job” as a biblical figure, “job” as a computing batch process, or casual uses like “did a good job” that don’t pertain to employment. Edge cases include documents that use “occupation,” “role,” or “position” without the word “job” (still relevant), versus papers on transparency or surveys that only mention “job” in passing without analyzing employment constructs (likely not relevant).</narr>

<title>job satisfaction</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks empirical research on the determinants of job satisfaction and how they differ across demographics, roles, occupations, and countries. They want evidence on factors such as job characteristics, work-life balance, stress, and organizational commitment, and how these relate to outcomes like performance, turnover, and well-being.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly examines job satisfaction as a primary variable—measuring its levels, determinants, or consequences—and may do so within specific groups (e.g., men vs. women, supervisors vs. non-supervisors, Gen Y, housekeepers) or contexts (e.g., work-life balance, job insecurity, job characteristics, QWL), often using survey data or validated scales. Studies where job satisfaction acts as a mediator or moderator in models of performance, commitment, turnover intent, or well-being are also relevant, as are analyses using large datasets like ISSP, EVS, EU-SILC, or PIAAC that compare satisfaction across countries, ages, or occupations. Papers are non-relevant if they mention “job satisfaction” only tangentially, focus on other forms of satisfaction (e.g., customer or life satisfaction) without explicitly linking to job satisfaction, or use “satisfaction” in unrelated senses. Edge cases include research on engagement, stress, or organizational commitment: these are relevant only if the relationship to job satisfaction is explicitly modeled or tested; domain-specific or methodological duplicates remain relevant when job satisfaction is a focal outcome, but mere passing references or generic “job” discussions are not.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks survey-based research on job satisfaction and its determinants, including working conditions, pay, hours, job security, mobility, company characteristics, and unionization. It also encompasses demographic breakdowns and related attitudes (e.g., retraining, co-determination, equal opportunities), with emphasis on German contexts such as changes around unification.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly measures or analyzes job, work, or occupational satisfaction, including named scales (e.g., the SAZ short form) or items like wage satisfaction, satisfaction with job security, promotion prospects, workplace atmosphere, or relationships with colleagues and superiors; examples include surveys of coal and steel employees, EDP users, central Hesse workers, machine fitters, and working mothers. Studies that link job satisfaction to determinants such as wage systems and bonuses, working hours and shift work, commuting distance and costs, company size, co-determination, union membership, retraining, or compare satisfaction across periods (e.g., before/after German unification) or groups (retrainees, guest workers, farmers) are also clearly relevant. Documents where job satisfaction appears as one module within broader quality-of-life surveys remain relevant if they contain a distinct job satisfaction scale or items tied to employment. Non-relevant materials focus only on non-job domains (life or housing satisfaction, neighborhood/yard satisfaction, consumer habits, politics) or discuss employment factors (wages, job security, mobility, training) without any evaluative satisfaction component. Edge cases: synonyms like work satisfaction, occupational satisfaction, satisfaction with choice of occupation, and wage satisfaction should count; student surveys are relevant only when they include post-study or employment-related job satisfaction, not merely satisfaction with study conditions.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>Looking for survey questionnaire items and measures of job/work satisfaction — including overall satisfaction scales (0–10 and categorical), feelings of entitlement/deservedness, related satisfaction items (e.g., housewife, life, democracy), and linked job variables (current/first job type, occupation, full/part‑time and second jobs, skills, temporary job reasons, and status compared with father’s job).</desc>
	<narr>This document is relevant because it explicitly contains multiple job- and work-satisfaction items and a named "work satisfaction scale," including direct survey wording like "On the whole are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your work" and a 0–10 satisfaction rating (0 = completely dissatisfied, 10 = very satisfied). It also includes related well‑being items (housewife satisfaction, life satisfaction) that can be useful when a broader view of job‑related happiness or comparative satisfaction across domains is desired. Parts of the text that focus on occupation classification — lists of job types, first job vs current job, full/part‑time status, and comparisons to a father’s job — are about job characteristics rather than satisfaction and are therefore non‑relevant for a strict "job satisfaction" query. Edge cases: documents that mention "satisfaction" but only about democracy or life satisfaction are only partially relevant unless the user wants multi‑domain measures; conversely, a page that only lists job titles without any evaluative questions would be non‑relevant despite being about jobs.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking validated instruments and survey scales to assess job satisfaction and related employee experience constructs, including their dimensions (e.g., colleagues, supervisor, work conditions, pay) and evidence of reliability and validity for use in organizational or social surveys.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly measures, analyzes, or explains job satisfaction in the workplace, for example multi-item job satisfaction scales with subdimensions such as colleagues, supervisor, pay, development, working conditions, and activity, or broader instruments like the Employee Experience Questionnaire that explicitly includes a job satisfaction construct with validated psychometrics. Studies linking work characteristics to job satisfaction—e.g., task variety, autonomy (freedom of decision), mental job requirements, or organizational transparency dimensions tied to job satisfaction—are also relevant. Edge cases include instruments where job satisfaction is one facet among others (employee experience or flourishing indices), occupation-specific measures (e.g., teachers’ occupational satisfaction with pay and working atmosphere), or language adaptations/validations that are used to assess job satisfaction in organizational contexts. Non-relevant content focuses on satisfaction outside the job domain (general life or study satisfaction, political system satisfaction), occupational coding/classification (ISCO/KldB) without attitudinal outcomes, or personality/affect scales (optimism, cross-cultural loss) unless they explicitly examine effects on job satisfaction. Similarly, measures of customer orientation or customer satisfaction are only tangentially relevant unless they connect to employees’ job satisfaction.</narr>

<title>depression</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks scholarly information on depression, including its prevalence across populations, validated assessment tools, and associations with comorbidities and social factors (e.g., pain, obesity, health literacy, ostracism, bullying, loneliness, age, gender). They also want insights into consequences like suicide risk, quality of life, and political engagement, and implications for prevention and clinical interventions.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “depression” when it directly examines depressive disorders or symptoms in humans, such as studies reporting prevalence, risk factors, comorbidities, measurement tools (e.g., PHQ-9, BDI, CDSS), or treatment/clinical implications. For example, research on depression in schizophrenia using PANSS and the Calgary Depression Scale, adolescent studies linking bullying, loneliness, rumination, or pain intensity to depressive symptoms, or surveys connecting health literacy or age with depression are all clearly relevant. Documents that focus on adjacent phenomena but use depression as a key outcome or mediator—like effects on political participation or peer ostracism—are still relevant if depression is measured and interpreted as a central construct. Edge cases include pieces about “depression” in non-mental-health senses (economic recessions, geological depressions), which are non-relevant, and work on animal depression or veterinary antidepressants, which may be only partially relevant unless explicitly tied back to human depressive disorder constructs and diagnostics. Mentions of depression that are incidental (e.g., a covariate in a study primarily about unrelated outcomes without analysis of depressive symptoms) are marginally relevant at best.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks studies and datasets related to “depression,” including mental health depression measured in German surveys of youth and adults (stress, bullying, unemployment, substance use, PHQ/FPI scales) and analyses of the economic Great Depression in interwar Germany. It aims to identify where and how depression is assessed or discussed across these social science and historical sources.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to “depression” if it substantively addresses psychological depression—its symptoms, measurement, prevalence, correlates, or treatment—including synonyms and operationalizations such as depressive symptoms, melancholy/hopelessness, PHQ scales, FPI depression subscales, suicidal ideation, or use of antidepressants. For example, surveys that record depressive symptoms among youths, PHQ depression tendencies, depressive moods in workplace health modules, or adult health surveys listing diagnosed depression and related complaints are clearly on-topic. It is also relevant when “depression” denotes an economic depression, such as analyses of Germany’s Great Depression, banking crises, wage dynamics, or policy responses framed explicitly as “the depression.” By contrast, documents are weakly or non-relevant if “depression” appears only as a fleeting item in a long variable list without discussion, or if the focus is on politics, education, or religiosity with no substantive treatment of depression. Edge cases include scale labels (e.g., FPI “depression”) or phrases like “depressive moods,” which count as relevant, whereas unrelated usages (e.g., geographic or meteorological depressions, or words like “depressurization”) do not.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for and comparing survey items and variable codes that measure self-reported depressive symptoms (e.g., "felt unhappy and depressed" in the past 4 weeks or "I was depressed/down" in the last week), timing of last episode, functional impairment from emotional problems (cut down activity, accomplish less, less careful, missed work), and help‑seeking preferences (who they'd turn to first/second). They want these items, response options, and variable names mapped across multiple surveys/instruments (e.g., ISSP, QA3/QA8, various V/v codes, parent reports) for harmonization or analysis.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant when it contains survey items, variable labels, or questionnaire metadata that directly measure feeling "unhappy and depressed" or "depressed/down" (for example: "During the past 4 weeks how often have you felt unhappy and depressed" or "In the last week I was depressed/down" with listed response codes). Highly relevant documents also include follow-up help‑seeking questions ("Who would you turn to first/second if you felt a bit down?"), functional‑impairment items tied to emotional problems (cut down activity, accomplished less, missed work), or exact variable IDs (v55, Q16c, V41, v116, etc.). Moderately relevant material would discuss depression broadly (clinical criteria, treatment, or population prevalence) or contain questionnaire names (ISSP) without the specific item text or response scales; datasets that only list variable names but not question wording are borderline. Non‑relevant items are uses of "depression" in other domains (economic depression), documents about anxiety only, or texts that mention related words like "sad" without a defined time frame or response options. Edge cases include translated or paraphrased items (e.g., "unhappy" vs "depressed"), derived summary scores (a "depression_score" variable without its items), and instruments that change the recall window (last week vs past 4 weeks), all of which may be partially relevant depending on whether the original item text or mapping is present.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking information on assessing depression in students using questionnaire-based scales—such as the Giessen Test grounded in Beck’s depression model—to screen for psychosocial impairment and understand links with procrastination and social factors.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “depression” if it discusses depressive symptoms, diagnosis, theory, or measurement—for example, describing vegetative symptoms, depressive mood, or scales grounded in the Beck depression model, as with the Giessen Test short scales measuring “depressivity” and psychological impairment. Materials that present validated screening tools, psychosocial constructs tied to depression (e.g., social rejection, unsteadiness), or preventive interventions for depression count as relevant even if the focus is on assessment rather than treatment. Content that only mentions related behaviors like procrastination is relevant if it explicitly links them to depressive affect or cognitions (e.g., “depressive moods,” irrational thoughts) but not if procrastination is discussed without a depression connection. Non-relevant items are those using “depression” in non-mental-health senses (economic or geological depression) or that list “depression” as a passing term without substantive detail. Edge cases include texts using near-synonyms (“depressivity”) or focusing on comorbid psychosomatic/vegetative complaints; these remain relevant when they are framed within a depression model or screening context.</narr>

<title>klimaschutz</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is looking for analyses of climate protection policies and instruments across local, national, and international levels, including their integration into planning, barriers to implementation, and drivers of public support. They want case-based insights and recent political developments affecting climate action (e.g., Paris Agreement dynamics, US and EU policy, municipal initiatives).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “klimaschutz” when it focuses on climate protection/mitigation measures, policies, or governance aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, whether at municipal, national, or international level—for example, integrated municipal climate protection concepts, EU or U.S. CO2 standards for power plants, evaluations of the Paris Agreement, or pricing of emissions. Analyses of public opinion and political dynamics are also relevant if they affect support for or implementation of climate protection, such as surveys on willingness to back climate policies, narrative strategies to build majorities, or indices that measure municipal engagement in climate mitigation and adaptation. Planning and implementation contexts count when they integrate Klimaschutz into spatial or regional development, funding programs (e.g., Kommunalrichtlinie), or cross-border energy transition projects with explicit mitigation objectives. By contrast, pieces that address only climate adaptation without linking to mitigation, general energy geopolitics or trade with only passing references to climate goals, or environmental topics (biodiversity, flood control) lacking an explicit mitigation focus are non-relevant. Edge cases include methodological or governance studies (e.g., pretesting texts for climate interventions, federalism’s impact on building-sector rules); these are relevant if they substantively inform the design, adoption, or effectiveness of climate protection instruments, but not if they merely name-drop Klimaschutz.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks datasets and reports on German public attitudes toward climate change and climate protection, including views on the Energiewende, responsibility of actors, personal behaviors, and evaluations of specific measures (e.g., CO2 pricing, speed limits, EV incentives, GEG). It specifically looks for methodology, demographics, and time trends (2021–2024) from recurring CATI dual-frame surveys by Kantar/Verian and related German Internet Panel modules.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to “klimaschutz” if it substantively addresses climate protection—policies, measures, or public attitudes aimed at reducing emissions—such as CO2 pricing/abgabe, subsidies for energy‑efficient retrofits and heating, electric‑vehicle incentives and charging, speed limits, kerosene taxes, coal phase‑out, or progress in the Energiewende. Survey reports are relevant when they measure who should act (government, industry, utilities, consumers), familiarity with initiatives (e.g., Klimakabinett), or expected impacts on prices and sectors like mobility, energy, buildings, and agriculture. Content about climate change risks, extreme weather, or floods is relevant if it links to mitigation or protection actions; broad environmental or health topics are only borderline unless tied to greenhouse‑gas reduction. Non‑relevant documents focus solely on demographics or sampling methods, cover unrelated policies (health system, pensions, smartphone habits) without a climate connection, or mention “Klimaschutz” only in passing without discussing concrete measures. Edge cases include mobility or tourism pieces (e.g., Germanyticket, flying less) that become relevant when framed around emission cuts, and EU‑level discussions (lobbying, legal enforcement) that are pertinent when they address the EU’s climate‑protection stance.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>Seeking public opinions on climate protection in Germany — specifically whether the federal government, businesses and citizens are doing enough and how effective protests are — plus expectations for international talks (e.g., G8) and which political party best represents the respondent’s preferred climate policies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "Klimaschutz" if it substantively discusses climate protection—naming actors (Bundesregierung, G8, political parties, companies, citizens), describing policies or measures, reporting opinions or survey results, or situating actions in time (e.g., week numbers or summit dates). For example, a survey transcript asking whether the government is doing enough, a news report on G8 commitments, or a policy brief describing measures and responsibilities would be clearly relevant. A document is non-relevant if the word appears only incidentally (in a list, metadata tag, repeated template code like V267/V246, or as an isolated caption) or if the text is about an unrelated topic that merely mentions "Klimaschutz" once. Edge cases include repetitive survey question dumps that signal the topic but contain no substantive answers (partially relevant for intent detection but low informational value), and translations or snippets where meaning is ambiguous. In ranking, prioritize documents with concrete actions, outcomes, dates, or quantified opinions, and de-prioritize boilerplate, duplicate entries, or single-token occurrences.</narr>

They also want details on the cognitive pretesting of the baseline information text via telephone interviews to ensure comprehension and decision-making.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “klimaschutz” if it substantively addresses climate protection—such as mitigation policies, interventions, programs, or research on behaviors and communication that aim to reduce emissions—even when framed through methodology (e.g., field experiments, cognitive pretests) so long as the focus remains on Klimaschutz actions or decisions. German-language content is fully relevant, and related terminology like mitigation, CO2 reduction, emissions targets, or institutional initiatives (e.g., university or government projects) also qualifies. Non-relevant items include pages that only mention “Klimaschutz” in passing (navigation labels, event lists), texts about climate change broadly without protective measures, or cases where the term appears in a name without environmental context. Edge cases include methodological studies on complexity or motivation that never tie findings to climate-protection behaviors; these are borderline unless they explicitly connect to Klimaschutz interventions or decision-making. The provided paragraph is relevant because it describes a research project testing how information complexity affects decisions in a climate-protection intervention and outlines its cognitive interview pretesting.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks comprehensive, scholarly information on racism, including its definitions, historical development, and major forms (e.g., antisemitic, anti-Black, and anti-Muslim/“neo-racism”). They also want analyses of how racism operates through language, media, nationalism, and the economy, along with empirical findings and policy or civil-society responses in Germany and Europe.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “rassismus” if it directly defines, analyzes, measures, or historicizes racism, including discussions of antisemitism, anti-Black racism, anti-Muslim “neo-racism,” racism in language and media, or policy and NGO responses to racism. Empirical studies using surveys or methods (e.g., ALLBUS regressions, structural equation models), theoretical accounts linking racism to nationalism, class, colonialism, or discourse, and historical overviews from early caste systems to the Holocaust and post-1945 developments are clearly on-topic. Texts centered on xenophobia, ethnocentrism, or “Ausländerfeindlichkeit” are relevant when they explicitly compare or distinguish these from racism; if they discuss generic prejudice or immigration policy without tying it to racism, they are borderline or non-relevant. Non-relevant items include uses of “Rasse” in biological taxonomy or animal breeding, casual metaphorical mentions, or acronyms/brand names that match the string (e.g., ICE, ZARA) without engaging anti-racism work. Edge cases like critiques of anti-racism strategies, methodological debates, or governance measures are relevant if they substantively engage the concept or practice of racism in context.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking research and survey data on racism in Germany, focusing on public perceptions and lived experiences—particularly among people with migration backgrounds—and the prevalence of related prejudices (xenophobia, antisemitism, Islamophobia). They also want contextual measures such as media coverage, trust in institutions and police, evaluations of anti-racism policies, social integration, and demographic/political correlates.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “rassismus” when it directly examines racism—such as perceptions and lived experiences of racial discrimination, attitudes toward minorities, or policy responses—especially in concrete contexts like post–George Floyd debates in Germany. Materials that operationalize racism via surveys or scales, or that analyze related constructs (e.g., Fremdenfeindlichkeit, xenophobia, Islamophobia, antisemitism) as part of a broader racism framework, also count as relevant; for example, questionnaires asking about racist prejudices in daily life, trust in police, and evaluation of anti-racism policies. Content analyses of media coverage of “Ausländer” are relevant when they code or interpret racist framing, language, or portrayals. By contrast, documents that only list “Rassismus” among many tags without substantive treatment, or that focus solely on economics, EU governance, or demographics without linking them to racism, are non-relevant. Edge cases include formal coding schemes or topic lists: they are relevant if they include and use “Rassismus” items in analysis, but borderline if they merely enumerate categories without examining racist content or effects.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user seeks a clear explanation of racism, specifically how racial bias contributes to recent U.S. incidents of police violence and the resulting protests. They likely want to know causes, examples, and possible policy responses such as the proposed increased deployment of federal law enforcement.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "rassismus" if it explicitly addresses racial discrimination, racial motivations or outcomes (for example police violence directed at racial minorities), or the social and political responses to such allegations. The provided paragraph — which links police violence, accusations of racism in the USA, protests, and the federal government’s decision to deploy federal police — is clearly relevant because it foregrounds race as a cause of unrest and policy reaction. A text that only mentions protests or law-and-order measures without connecting them to racial bias, or that uses the term "Rassismus" only rhetorically without substantive discussion, would be less relevant. Edge cases include articles that discuss racialized outcomes without using the word "rassismus" (still relevant), or opinion pieces that claim racism without evidence (relevant but weaker); language or topical shifts (e.g., discussing immigration or workplace bias rather than policing) change the degree but not necessarily the relevance.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>A person searching "rassismus" here likely wants to know how negative and positive attitudes toward outgroups are conceptualized and measured — specifically the distinction that they form independent continua and the existence of a German Allophilie scale (five subdimensions: affection, comfort, kinship, engagement, enthusiasm) and a Law-and-Order scale for xenophobic, state-control attitudes. They may also be seeking information on these scales' development (based on Pittinsky et al. and Fend) and their validation evidence (construct, convergent/discriminant, and criterion validity).</desc>
	<narr>This document is relevant to the query "rassismus" because it describes validated instruments that measure attitudes toward outgroups—both positive (Allophilia: affection, comfort, kinship, engagement, enthusiasm) and negative (Law-and-Order: rejection of the foreign and support for coercive state measures)—which are central constructs in research on racism and xenophobia. It gives concrete details (scale structure, three items per subscale, validation with persons from foreign cultures) that make it useful for someone seeking measurement tools or empirical studies of prejudice. It may be less relevant if the searcher is looking for legal definitions, historical accounts, hate-crime case reports, or analyses of structural/institutional racism, because the paragraph focuses on psychological scales and attitudes rather than policy or lived incidents. An important edge case: Allophilia captures positive feelings toward outgroups and can miss subtle or covert racism, while the Law-and-Order scale targets authoritarian anti-foreigner tendencies—so researchers should consider adapting the scales if they need race-specific, systemic, or behavioral measures.</narr>

<title>kinderbetreuung</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks comprehensive information on childcare, including types of care (institutional vs. family), availability and hours, costs and funding, and legal/regulatory frameworks. They also want evidence and comparisons—especially for Austria, Germany, and the EU—on how childcare provision influences work–family balance, gender equality, and fertility.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it primarily addresses Kinderbetreuung (child care) as a system or practice—e.g., describing forms of care (Krippe, Kindergarten, Tagesmutter), structural features (opening hours, age limits, group size), legal frameworks, funding/costs, quality, supply-demand statistics, or employer-provided childcare models. Works that analyze how childcare relates to work–family reconciliation, fertility decisions, or gender equality, including cross-country or historical comparisons, are also relevant when childcare is a central variable with concrete data or policy discussion. Examples of strong relevance include Austrian or EU overviews of childcare regulations and utilization, evaluations of corporate childcare initiatives, or reports on user satisfaction and quality standards. Non-relevant items are those that only mention Kinderbetreuung in passing within broader topics (such as the gender pay gap or general household labor) without substantive detail on care provision, policy, or usage, or where the term appears only in an index or brief aside. Edge cases like youth perspectives on ideal care, analyses focused on monetary subsidies for under-6s, or historical narratives remain relevant if they explicitly define and assess childcare arrangements; by contrast, purely methodological notes without findings or pieces that shift away from childcare to unrelated family policy issues would be marginal.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks information on childcare in Germany: types and availability of care, responsibilities of providers (municipal vs. state), costs/support, and impacts on parents’ employment, gender roles, and family life. They may also want survey-based evidence on how childcare arrangements changed during policy shifts or crises such as COVID-19.</desc>
	<narr>For the query “kinderbetreuung,” documents are relevant if they address childcare services, arrangements, or policies—such as availability and types of care (Kita, daycare, preschool, after-school care, childminders), parental leave and division of care, costs/subsidies, usage and satisfaction, or impacts on parents’ employment and time allocation. Studies that examine municipal responsibility for childcare, family support networks (e.g., grandparents’ care), or COVID-era changes in children’s care and schooling are also relevant, as are time-use diaries that quantify hours spent on childcare. Documents become less relevant when “Betreuung” refers to groups other than children (e.g., elder or healthcare support), or when childcare is only listed among many topics without substantive discussion, methods, findings, or policy detail. Edge cases that still count include broader family-policy pieces comparing cash benefits versus expansion of childcare, household expenditure sections that include childcare spending, or education-focused texts that cover supervision and care outside teaching hours. Synonyms and near-terms such as daycare, nursery, Kita, childminding, babysitting, or “Betreuungssituation” for children should be treated as relevant signals.</narr>

It also covers related topics like time spent on housework and childcare, career interruptions for caregiving, concerns about misuse of childcare payments, and minor/mini-job employment involving childcare.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "kinderbetreuung" if it directly addresses child care in Germany—e.g. surveys or policy texts asking who should provide care, how long parents interrupted paid work for childcare, Betreuungsgeld debates, hours spent on child care, or COVID-related school and daycare closures and reopenings. Highly relevant examples are questionnaires, government reports or research papers measuring parental leave, household division of care tasks, mini‑job descriptions that explicitly list childcare as a typical activity, or analyses of misuse concerns around Betreuungsgeld. Documents are non‑relevant when they only mention childcare tangentially (for instance as one item in a long unrelated list), focus strictly on unrelated household chores while explicitly excluding childcare, are mere metadata or duplicates, or discuss employment thresholds without any linkage to child care. Borderline cases include texts that list “childcare” as a brief example among many (these may be useful for context but offer little depth), or sources describing childcare in other countries or in an outdated legal/currency context (e.g. DM vs. EUR), which may require temporal or geographic filtering to judge true relevance.</narr>

	<desc>The user is looking for information about childcare ("kinderbetreuung") — what types of care are available, how to find and enroll children, typical hours and age groups, costs, and any subsidies or regulations. Their goal is to choose and arrange appropriate, reliable care for a child.</desc>
	<narr>Documents are relevant to the query "kinderbetreuung" when they directly address childcare: descriptions of daycare, kindergarten and after‑school programs; how to apply; opening hours; costs and subsidies; staff qualifications; legal definitions and local regulations. Highly relevant examples include municipal lists of childcare providers, application forms for a Kita place, fee schedules, eligibility rules for subsidies, or official guidance on child-to-staff ratios. Non-relevant documents either do not meaningfully discuss childcare (e.g., a passing mention of the word), cover unrelated topics that happen to include the term, or use the word in a different sense (such as a fictional title or an unrelated compound). Edge cases include materials where "kinderbetreuung" appears only in metadata or images (OCR may be needed), academic papers on early childhood theory that lack practical service information (partly relevant), or documents from other countries whose systems differ but still offer useful comparisons. Also consider language and recency: German-language, up‑to‑date local or legal information will usually be more useful than outdated or purely historical references.</narr>

<title>vertrauen</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an interdisciplinary overview of trust (Vertrauen)—what it is, how it develops and can turn into mistrust, its moral limits, and key types (generalized, interpersonal, institutional). They want theories and empirical findings on determinants and functions of trust in democracy, organizations, social relations, and media, including debates over civil-society vs. institutional mechanisms and measurement (e.g., ALLBUS).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively examines Vertrauen (trust) as a concept—how it is defined, formed, limited, and how it turns into Misstrauen (mistrust)—using philosophical, sociological, political, or social-psychological frameworks. Strong signals include differentiating types of trust (generalized vs. interpersonal, institutional vs. personal, strategic/rational vs. moral/identity-based), specifying mechanisms that generate trust (e.g., civil society vs. institutional fairness, leadership and organizational culture), and presenting empirical evidence or measures (such as ESS/ALLBUS surveys, media or political trust cases). Analyses that model causal pathways, critique game-theoretic reductions, or show the co-evolution of trust with institutions and networks in democracies are especially relevant. Non-relevant items merely mention “vertrauen” rhetorically, revolve around unrelated meanings (legal trusts, “trusted” computing), or discuss cooperation/management without treating trust as the central analytic variable. Edge cases include work centered on mistrust or deception (still relevant if tied to trust dynamics), bibliographic lists or duplicated abstracts (weakly relevant unless they add analysis), and narrow sectoral studies (youth work, journalism) that count only when they explicitly explain determinants, measurement, and effects of trust.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking survey-based research on trust (Vertrauen) across politics, society, and technology—public trust in governments, institutions (e.g., NATO/EU, courts, police), media, and platforms—and its determinants and effects. Emphasis is on how trust shapes acceptance of COVID-19 measures, welfare and security policies, and data sharing/privacy under GDPR, drawing on sources like Eurobarometer and the World Values Survey.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “vertrauen” when it treats trust as a central concept—measuring, analyzing, or explaining trust (e.g., public trust in government, politicians, institutions like NATO/EU/UN, mass media, or generalized social trust) and its consequences, such as acceptance of COVID-19 measures or willingness to share data with apps. Survey-based materials that include explicit “Vertrauen in …” variables, indices from Eurobarometer or World Values Survey (general trust, institutional trust), or models linking trust to behaviors (e.g., technology acceptance, policy support) are strongly relevant. By contrast, texts that only mention the word in passing (e.g., “vertrauensbildende Maßnahme” without measuring trust), lists of names or topics without trust-related analysis, or discussions of security/military issues that do not assess trust are weakly or non-relevant. Edge cases include inverse formulations like “Misstrauen” (often still relevant), ambiguous uses such as parliamentary “Vertrauensfrage” (relevant only if about citizens’ trust, not procedural votes), and non-social meanings of trust (legal “Treuhand,” cryptographic trust stores, or statistical “confidence”) which are non-relevant. German-language documents spanning multiple domains can be relevant as long as trust is a key variable rather than a incidental term.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>The user wants to measure or report levels of trust ("Vertrauen") in institutions — e.g., the Bundestag, courts, churches/religious organizations, health system, large private companies and public authorities — using a 0–10 rating scale. They need concise survey wording or a description of respondents' task to indicate how much trust they have in each institution.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "vertrauen" if it explicitly treats trust—especially survey items or measures asking respondents to rate their trust in institutions (for example the Bundestag, courts, churches, authorities, health care or large private companies) or presents results from such questions; repeated survey prompts and the 0–10 trust scale in the paragraph are strong signals of relevance. Examples of clearly relevant content are questionnaires that ask "Wieviel Vertrauen haben Sie in...?" or tables showing average trust scores for V664 (Bundestag), V456 (behörden), V539 (Gesundheitswesen) and similar codes. It is non-relevant when the word appears incidentally (e.g., as part of a company name, in another language, as OCR/redundant template noise with no substantive data) or when the document discusses unrelated concepts that happen to contain the string "vertrauen." Edge cases include metadata or code lists (the V/J/I tags) — these are relevant if they accompany the survey item or results but borderline if they appear alone with no questionnaire context; likewise translated or summarized reports are relevant only if they retain the actual trust questions or numeric measures.</narr>

They want to understand how trust is measured and how factors like COVID-19, media use, and survey methods influence trust levels.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “vertrauen” if it substantively discusses trust as a concept or measure, for example describing interpersonal trust scales like KUSIV3, trust as part of leader–employee relationship quality, or trust in politics, science, and survey results. Content that operationalizes or evaluates trust or mistrust through items, subscales, or pretest findings—such as items capturing Vertrauen/Misstrauen toward others, trust in bodily self-presentation, or links between media use and social trust—is also clearly relevant. Materials where trust is only a peripheral mention within broader topics (e.g., panels on partnership status or dietary styles) are borderline unless they explicitly analyze trust or report measurements or effects tied to it. Non-relevant content would focus on unrelated constructs (e.g., communication access) without connecting them to trust, or use “Vertrauen” only in passing or as boilerplate. Edge cases include documents centered on Misstrauen (mistrust) without the word Vertrauen—which should still be treated as relevant—and instances where trust is bundled within composite indices; conversely, occurrences in titles or metadata without analytic content would not qualify.</narr>

<title>lebenszufriedenheit</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking an overview of research on life satisfaction, especially in Germany, including how it is defined, measured, and how it varies across groups. They want evidence on determinants such as religion, income and employment, parenthood, migration background, education setting, region/urban context, physical attractiveness, retirement, and COVID-19, as well as the datasets commonly used (e.g., ALLBUS, SOEP, pairfam, NEPS, SHARE, GEDA).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly analyzes Lebenszufriedenheit (life satisfaction) as a central construct—measured or modeled with surveys, correlations/regressions, or established datasets (e.g., ALLBUS, SOEP, pairfam, NEPS, SHARE). Highly relevant examples include studies on how evangelical faith, parenthood, migration background, physical attractiveness, retirement, pandemic-related shocks, or regional context affect Lebenszufriedenheit, especially when distinguishing general vs. domain satisfactions or linking area-specific satisfaction to overall life satisfaction. Works that focus only on domain-specific satisfaction (job, partnership, income, infrastructure) are relevant only when they explicitly relate those domains to overall Lebenszufriedenheit or use Lebenszufriedenheit as the outcome; otherwise they are non-relevant. Texts using near-synonyms such as subjektives Wohlbefinden, happiness, or the Satisfaction With Life Scale count as relevant when clearly equated with Lebenszufriedenheit, whereas pieces that merely mention the term in passing (e.g., a citation or policy slogan) or discuss customer/service satisfaction are not. Edge cases include capitalization or language variants (Lebenszufriedenheit/lebenszufriedenheit, “life satisfaction”) and population-focused analyses (mothers, immigrants, students) that remain relevant if life satisfaction is central, while duplicates or abstracts listing the term without substantive analysis are only weakly relevant.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is looking for surveys and datasets that measure life satisfaction (Lebenszufriedenheit) and related domains, primarily in Germany (e.g., Hamburg, Cologne, migrant populations) with some comparative European coverage, to support empirical analysis of its determinants and trends.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it measures, analyzes, or reports on Lebenszufriedenheit (life satisfaction), either as an overall rating or via a specific scale, and may include related domain satisfactions (e.g., income, health, housing) used to assess general life satisfaction. Clear examples include survey or dataset descriptions listing “Allgemeine Lebenszufriedenheit,” “Skala Lebenszufriedenheit,” or modules on life satisfaction within broader studies (e.g., Hamburg BUS, Eurobarometer, integration or migration surveys that ask about life satisfaction). Documents are non-relevant if they only address narrow satisfactions like Wohnzufriedenheit or Arbeitszufriedenheit without linking to overall life satisfaction, or if “Lebenszufriedenheit” appears only in boilerplate metadata with no substantive measurement or discussion. Edge cases: texts using German synonyms like Wohlbefinden or Glück, or English “life satisfaction,” are relevant if they clearly refer to the construct; multi-topic political or social surveys remain relevant when they contain a life satisfaction item or scale. Conversely, general political commentary or historical overviews that merely list the term without data, variables, or findings on life satisfaction should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for a clear explanation of a German survey item about "Lebenszufriedenheit" — a single-item measure asking respondents to rate their overall life satisfaction on a 1–7 scale, introduced by two contrasting self-evaluation vignettes. They likely want to understand the question’s purpose, wording and how to administer or interpret responses in a survey or research context.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "lebenszufriedenheit" when it directly addresses life satisfaction as a self-evaluation — for example the dialog between two friends about how satisfied they feel and the repeated 1–7 satisfaction question in this paragraph — or when it presents measurement items, Likert scales, or survey modes (CAWI, MAIL) used to assess life satisfaction. Content that discusses subjective well‑being, life satisfaction scales (e.g., explicit 1 = very unsatisfied to 7 = very satisfied), or translations of those questions into other languages is also highly relevant because it bears on how lebenszufriedenheit is operationalized and measured. A document is not relevant if it only uses the word "Leben" in other contexts (life insurance, biological life) or treats happiness abstractly without linking to personal satisfaction or self‑report measurement; a single offhand mention of "Lebenszufriedenheit" in a bibliography can be a weak match. Edge cases include materials that duplicate questionnaire items many times (noise but still relevant), methodological papers on survey administration (relevant if they concern measurement of life satisfaction, but only tangentially if they focus solely on sampling or statistics), and texts that use close synonyms (subjective well‑being, life quality) which should be considered relevant depending on whether they cover self‑rated satisfaction.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user wants German-language, validated measures and research for assessing life satisfaction and broader subjective well-being, including item wording, response scales, and validation. This includes the German SWLS, the SOEP single-item L1, the Human Flourishing Scale (FI/SFI), and studies on ranking-based measures and DDR-specific surveys.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly measures, validates, or conceptually defines Lebenszufriedenheit (life satisfaction), for example by presenting or testing scales like the SWLS (Diener et al.), the SOEP single-item L-1 with its 11-point response options, RankMe’s ranking approach, or German translations/psychometrics and cognitive pretests (web probing, telephone interviews). It is also relevant if broader wellbeing instruments (e.g., the Human Flourishing Scale with FI/SFI) explicitly include life satisfaction as a dimension or report findings about it, or if it discusses the affective vs. cognitive evaluative components of life satisfaction in line with Diener. Partially relevant cases include studies where life satisfaction is one of several outcomes (e.g., DDR participation surveys that also ask about Lebenszufriedenheit) or where related constructs like Lebensfreude/Wohlbefinden are covered only insofar as they tie back to life satisfaction measurement. Non-relevant documents focus on other satisfactions (job/customer satisfaction), general political engagement without life satisfaction content, or mention the term only in passing without items, methods, or results. Edge cases include purely theoretical happiness narratives without link to measurement, or flourishing work that omits explicit life satisfaction indicators—these would be weakly or not relevant.</narr>

<title>kinderwunsch</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks research-based overviews of Kinderwunsch (desire for children), including how it is defined and measured, its determinants across the life course and partnership dynamics, and recent trends in German-speaking countries. They want to understand how values, socioeconomic conditions, and medical/biological factors affect the gap between desired and realized fertility and the role of policies and reproductive medicine in fulfilling childbearing intentions.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it focuses on Kinderwunsch (the desire to have children) by defining or measuring it (e.g., ideal vs intended vs expected/realistic number of children), analyzing its determinants (age, partnership status, socioeconomic factors, values), or linking it to realized fertility and family planning behavior. Examples of clearly relevant content include theoretical frameworks (biological, demographic, sociological, socio-psychological), dyadic negotiation of partners’ wishes, subgroup analyses (e.g., homosexual men, students, childless vs parents), and empirical work using surveys like GGS, GGP, PPAS, or the Mikrozensus, including trends, international comparisons, and operationalization choices. Studies that connect work–family arrangements, gender role attitudes, or policy/structural conditions to childbearing intentions, as well as medical/clinical discussions of infertility and reproductive medicine framed around fulfilling Kinderwunsch, are also relevant. A document is non-relevant if it treats only aggregate fertility levels or demographic aging without discussing individuals’ childbearing intentions, or if “Kinderwunsch” appears merely in a table of contents, citation list, or as a passing term unrelated to desire/intent. Edge cases include clinical reports focused solely on treatment efficacy without linking to intentions (weak relevance), or values/role-attitude studies that are relevant only when they explicitly tie those constructs to desired family size, fertility intentions, or the likelihood of realizing a childbearing wish.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks surveys and analyses on childbearing intentions (Kinderwunsch)—ideal number and timing of children, and reasons for or against (further) children—along with how partnership dynamics, work–family balance, housing, social policies, and socio-demographics shape these choices. They also want subgroup perspectives (women, men, youth, academics) and related outcomes such as parenting, career impacts, and living conditions.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “kinderwunsch” when it directly addresses fertility intentions or desire for children, for example discussing the ideal number of children, preferred timing of births, reasons for or against having a first or additional child, and the alignment of partners’ wishes. Highly relevant examples include survey modules on “Kinderwunsch der Befragten und des Partners,” “ideales Alter für das erste Kind,” “Gründe gegen die Realisierung eines weiteren Kinderwunsches,” or assessments of how social policies, childcare, career paths, and housing space affect deciding for or postponing children. Content on work–family balance, financial strain, health, or migration is also relevant if it explicitly links these factors to wanting children or fulfilling a child wish. By contrast, material that only covers housing, EU policy, general health checks, or employment conditions without tying them to fertility intentions, or that merely counts existing children without asking about desired children, is non-relevant. Edge cases include documents that mention “Kinderwunsch” only as a tag in a long topic list with no substantive detail, or pieces focused solely on parenting after birth; these are weakly or non-relevant unless they analyze the desire for future children or motives for childlessness.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants documentation or a clear summary of survey variables about "Kinderwunsch" (reasons for not wanting children), i.e., the coded response categories (economic, health, contraception, career/self‑realization, childcare availability, societal attitudes, environment/peace fears, abortion law, egoism, etc.). They also need the variable coding scheme showing how responses are recorded (e.g., mentioned vs. not mentioned and special codes for non‑response/other).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "kinderwunsch" when it explicitly addresses the desire for (or lack of desire for) children—especially when it lists survey variables or codebook entries like "Grund für nicht vorhandenen Kinderwunsch" (reasons for no desire to have children) and the S.Y2* codes. The paragraph is a strong match because it enumerates labeled categories (e.g., Egoismus, verbesserte Verhütungsmethoden, materielle/ökonomische Gründe, Berufstätigkeit der Frau, gesundheitliche Gründe, Kinderfeindlichkeit, Kindergartenplätze) and maps them to variable codes (S.Y2b, S.Y2f, S.Y2h, etc.), which is exactly the kind of structured content needed for analysis. It would be non-relevant if a document only mentions "Kinderwunsch" in a different sense (for example a fertility clinic or "Kinderwunschzentrum" offering treatments), or if it only contains unrelated administrative codes or general fertility statistics without reasons. Edge cases include texts that briefly mention items like "Liberalisierung des 218" (abortion law) — those may be partially relevant if they discuss how legal changes affect childbearing desires, but are less useful if the reference is incidental; repeated or "nicht erhoben" flags and duplicate lines reduce usefulness because they signal missing data or redundant metadata rather than substantive explanations.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user wants information on "kinderwunsch"—people’s fertility intentions and desired number of children—and how family-related norms and attitudes (e.g., views on fathers’ parental leave, parental employment, and concepts of family and partnership) influence those intentions in Germany. They may also seek how these attitudes are measured in surveys (questions about actual and ideal number of children) and tested using cognitive interviews, as in the BiB pretest.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "kinderwunsch" when it explicitly addresses fertility intentions or desired family size (terms like "gewünschte Kinderzahl," "ideale Kinderzahl," or "fertility intentions") or when it reports survey questions that measure people’s desire to have children. The paragraph is relevant because it explicitly mentions the desired and ideal number of children and tests attitude questions about parenting and parental leave using personally conducted cognitive interviews, which directly measure Kinderwunsch-related attitudes. Documents that analyze how family ideals, employment, or parental-leave policies influence the wish to have children are also highly relevant because they connect contextual factors to childbearing intentions. Edge cases include materials that only report fertility rates or demographic counts without assessing individual desires (partially relevant), papers focused on assisted reproductive technologies or clinical infertility care that use "Kinderwunsch" in a medical sense (potentially irrelevant to sociological intent), or discussions of family policy that never link to people’s childbearing intentions (less relevant).</narr>

Include reviews and methods for measuring media usage, especially in mobile and online contexts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it focuses on media use behaviors (Mediennutzung) itself—how, how much, and why people use media—across groups, platforms, or contexts, using empirical data or theoretical framing. Examples include studies of children’s and adolescents’ media use under conditions of social inequality, East–West German differences in TV consumption, student or migrant media habits, mobile and social media usage in everyday life, usage typologies and motives, or operationalizations of use in surveys (e.g., ALLBUS) and new measurement tools (e.g., WebTrack/AppKit). Also relevant are analyses linking media use to outcomes such as political participation, education, or family dynamics, so long as usage is a central variable being measured or explained. Non-relevant would be work that centers on media content, policy, or effects without analyzing users’ behaviors, purely theoretical pieces where Mediennutzung is only a side note, or industry reach summaries that lack user-level patterns or motivations. Edge cases like live tweeting as political performance, media competence in schools, local vs national public spheres, or DDR-era youth research are relevant if they report concrete usage patterns, motivations, or measurement; broad integration or cultural identity discussions without specific usage evidence are not.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks data and research on media usage in Germany—what media people use, how often, and how patterns have changed over time (e.g., linear vs non-linear, online/offline). They likely want time-series trends, cross-media comparisons, demographic breakdowns, and key sources such as the ARD/ZDF Media Study (including 2024).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses Mediennutzung (media usage) as behaviors or metrics—e.g., time spent, frequency, platforms (TV, radio, print, online, social), linear vs non-linear use, and demographic or trend analyses. Clear examples include survey reports like the ARD/ZDF Medienstudie, AGMA’s Media-Analyse, or municipal studies (e.g., Hamburg BUS) that quantify daily media time and compare usage across channels or years. Documents that merely list “Mediennutzung” among many topics without presenting findings, or that primarily discuss other themes (politics, environment, values) with no substantive usage data, are marginal or non-relevant. Edge cases: pieces about “media” in art or IT (e.g., storage media usage) or purely methodological notes without usage results are not relevant; by contrast, works using synonyms such as media consumption, media reception, or social media usage remain relevant if they analyze user behavior. Because the query is German, German-language or Germany-focused studies are especially pertinent, but comparative or international analyses that explicitly examine Mediennutzung also qualify.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants to assess an individual's media usage and preferences, specifically how often they watch TV and read a daily newspaper and how much they like different music genres. They also want ratings of interest in various types of TV programs using a scale from "very much" to "not at all."</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "mediennutzung" if it directly addresses individuals' media consumption patterns — for example survey items asking how many days per week someone watches TV, how often they read a newspaper, or how much they like different music genres. Questionnaire text, lists of media types, and response scales (very strong/strong/medium/low/not at all) are strong indicators of relevance; even if the material is in German or contains repeated or slightly garbled lines, it still maps to media-use measurement. A document is non-relevant when it discusses media in other senses (media production, technical specs, advertising strategy) or treats “media” only tangentially without measuring usage behaviors. Edge cases include documents that only cover one medium (e.g., music preference but not TV/newspapers) — still relevant but narrower in scope — and methodological or theoretical papers about media effects that do not contain concrete usage questions, which may be borderline. Relevance is highest when the text contains explicit frequency measures, question wording, or Likert-style interest ratings that could be used to quantify media use.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking research on media use and its psychological correlates—specifically how media-based empathy is conceptualized and measured (MBE scale) and how media use and video game immersion relate to empathy, aggression, and cyberbullying across age groups.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “mediennutzung” when it treats media use as a core concept—defining it, measuring it, or analyzing its patterns, contexts, or effects—rather than merely naming it. The paragraph is relevant because it operationalizes media-related behaviors (e.g., mediale Anteilnahme and immersion in video games) and explicitly ties them to Mediennutzung via construct validity, with evidence across youth and adult samples. A document would be non-relevant if it focuses on empathy, aggression, or cyberbullying without examining media-use behavior, frequency, platforms, or if “Mediennutzung” appears only as a passing correlate or control. Edge cases include psychometric studies that reference Mediennutzung solely to validate another scale (tangentially relevant) or pieces centered on a single mode like gaming immersion, which is a form of media use but may not satisfy searches for broad usage patterns or statistics.</narr>

They want to understand its key dimensions, how journalists and institutions shape it, and its effects on media use, public trust, and online contexts like anonymity.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it foregrounds “Glaubwürdigkeit” (credibility) as a core concept or variable—defining it, modelling its dimensions (e.g., competence, trustworthiness, dynamism, similarity, social approval, likability), measuring it, or analyzing its effects and rhetoric in communication. Highly relevant examples include studies of media credibility and usage, conversation-analytic work on defending/attacking credibility in disputes, analyses of credibility under internet anonymity, or surveys linking perceived news credibility with political attitudes. Also relevant are sector-specific pieces where credibility is the main stake—such as the credibility of the WHO after the swine flu, UN peacekeeping, NATO deterrence, political leaders (Macron, Lula), or the vocational training system—when they examine causes, consequences, or strategies to bolster or erode credibility. Non-relevant or only marginally relevant items mention the term in passing without conceptualization or measurement, focus primarily on other topics (e.g., a general media-effects overview or historical statistics report) and use “glaubwürdig” as a generic adjective rather than an analytic focus. Edge cases: methods papers on validating qualitative research or prebunking tools that rate source credibility are relevant, while texts on anonymity or morality qualify only if they explicitly connect those constructs to how credibility is assigned or perceived.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks survey measures and findings on credibility (Glaubwürdigkeit)—how people rate the trustworthiness of media, social networks, government communications, political parties, and institutions. They want data across multiple German studies and events, including Chernobyl, COVID-19, and the Ukraine war.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly measures or discusses credibility (Glaubwürdigkeit) of information or actors, for example “Glaubwürdigkeit der Informationen der Bundesregierung zur Corona-Krise,” “Glaubwürdigkeit sozialer Medien,” or comparisons of media credibility (newspapers vs radio/TV, Voice of America, etc.). It also counts when credibility is evaluated in specific contexts, such as risk communication after Chernobyl, credibility of political parties or leaders (e.g., SED/PDS), or credibility of sources about the Ukraine war. Documents that merely describe media usage, political preferences, or demographic variables without assessing credibility are non-relevant. Edge cases include credibility in entertainment contexts (e.g., “Glaubwürdigkeit der Probleme” in a TV series) or institutional reputation ratings; these match the keyword but may be less useful if the intent is credibility of news/information sources. Synonyms and variants like trust/trustworthiness, reliability, veracity, glaubwürdig/unglaubwürdig should be treated as relevant, while hits only in metadata, headers, or boilerplate without substantive discussion are not.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for public-opinion information on "Glaubwürdigkeit"—survey questions and (ideally) results about the credibility of German parties and politicians, specifically whether the CDU, SPD, Linke and figures like Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg and Kurt Beck are seen as more or less credible compared with the last state election.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant when it explicitly addresses "Glaubwürdigkeit" as a trait of parties or politicians—for example opinion‑poll questions or analyses asking “Hat sich die Glaubwürdigkeit der SPD/CDU im Vergleich zur letzten Landtagswahl verbessert oder verschlechtert?” or reports that “Glaubwürdigkeit beschädigt” in reference to Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg. Concrete evidence such as survey results, trend comparisons over time, news about scandals that affect public trust, or direct questions about Kurt Beck’s credibility are strong relevance signals. Documents that merely contain the word as metadata, repeat transcript fragments, list names (e.g., “Guttenberg”) without linking them to credibility, or use the term in an unrelated sense (e.g., methodological credibility of a study) should be treated as non‑relevant or lower priority unless the user’s intent is broader. Edge cases include methodological pieces on how to measure "Glaubwürdigkeit" (potentially relevant for a research intent) and translations or paraphrases in German that preserve the focus on political trust, which should still be considered relevant. Prioritize items that directly discuss party/politician trust and poll questions, and downrank noise, duplicate lines, or off‑topic usages.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking information on “credibility” (Glaubwürdigkeit) in a social-policy context, specifically how the perceived authenticity/credibility of asylum applications and related justice ideologies are conceptualized and measured in surveys across European countries.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses “Glaubwürdigkeit” (credibility) as a concept, especially in contexts like evaluating the authenticity of asylum applications, measuring perceived credibility, or discussing why certain beliefs or ideologies are seen as credible by stakeholders. For example, a study that introduces a survey instrument with items capturing perceptions of the authenticity/credibility of typical asylum claims, or that argues justice ideologies possess high credibility among adherents, directly matches the query. It is less relevant if it focuses on justice ideologies or pension policy without linking them to credibility, or if “Glaubwürdigkeit” appears only as a passing word with no analytical role. Edge cases include documents using near-synonyms (Echtheit, Vertrauenswürdigkeit), negations (Unglaubwürdigkeit), or domain-specific uses like “credible commitment” or actuarial “credibility” that may be relevant only if the text clearly concerns credibility in the intended sense. Mentions of “Glaubwürdigkeit” in unrelated contexts (e.g., a brief citation note or a tangential example) would be marginally relevant at best.</narr>

	<desc>Find research and guidance on employees in organizations—especially HR strategies for older workers, onboarding and internal communication, training and qualification, participative culture and leadership styles, and challenges like technostress amid digital transformation.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively discusses employees (Mitarbeiter) in organizations—such as HR policies, leadership and communication, training and onboarding, wellbeing/technostress, demographic change, or participation—e.g., integrated personnel management for over‑50s, surveys of employees, or programs to integrate new staff. It also counts when specific employee groups are the focus, like wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiter at universities or freie Mitarbeiter at newspapers, provided their working conditions, roles, or management are analyzed. Non‑relevant items are those where “Mitarbeiter” appears only incidentally (staff lists, author affiliations, institutional directories, publication notes) or where related terms mean something else (e.g., Mitarbeit as “collaboration,” or the word appearing only in an organization’s name). Edge cases include gendered and inclusive variants (Mitarbeiterinnen, Mitarbeiter/‑innen, “Mitarbeiter innen” from OCR), morphological variants (singular/plural), and near‑synonyms (Beschäftigte, Personal, Belegschaft) that may be conceptually on‑topic despite lacking the exact keyword. Another edge case is whether “freie Mitarbeiter” (contractors) meet the user’s intent if they seek only formal employees, and cross‑lingual matches where English “employee(s)” are relevant even if the German keyword is absent.</narr>

<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks information and survey data related to employees/staff, including their attitudes, motivation, participation in decision-making, working conditions and safety, and organizational climate. They are likely looking for studies on employee involvement and support mechanisms such as profit/capital sharing, training, and workplace literacy within companies and institutions.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it centers on employees or staff in organizations—e.g., topics like employee participation and motivation, profit or capital sharing for employees, works councils and employee representatives, functional illiteracy among workers, leadership styles toward subordinates, workplace safety and health, or organizational climate as perceived by employees. Synonyms and compounds count, such as Beschäftigte, Arbeitnehmer, Belegschaft, Personal, as well as Mitarbeiter‑ compounds (Mitarbeiterbeteiligung, Mitarbeiterbefragung) and phrases like unterstellte Mitarbeiter. Content about volunteer “Mitarbeiter” (e.g., church or community staffers) can be relevant when they function as staff members, but mere “Mitarbeit” (collaboration/volunteering) without the person noun is weakly relevant. Not relevant are hits where “Mitarbeiter” means “co-authors” (e.g., “v. Rosenstiel und Mitarbeitern”) or documents focused on unrelated themes (theology students, youth law education, family socialization, general innovation policy) without a staff/employee angle. Edge cases: documents on OSH or employer–employee surveys remain relevant even if they use Beschäftigte/Arbeitnehmer instead of the exact token “Mitarbeiter,” whereas purely demographic sections with no workforce context are not.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking whether someone was responsible for other employees and for how many (i.e., supervisory responsibility or number of staff supervised). This query is specifically in the context of former Stasi personnel — questions about prosecutions, candidacy in elections, and whether a spouse/partner held supervisory responsibility.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "mitarbeiter" if it contains substantive information about employees — for example explicit questions or statements about how many employees someone was responsible for, supervisory duties, employment status, or mentions of individuals as employees (e.g., "Für wie viele Mitarbeiter waren Sie verantwortlich", "Befr. für Mitarbeiter verantwortlich", or "ehem. Stasi Mitarbeiter"). Passages that discuss roles, headcounts, partner/spouse involvement with employee duties, or legal/administrative treatment of staff (such as prosecution of former Stasi employees) are also pertinent. A document is non-relevant when "Mitarbeiter" appears only as boilerplate, repeated form labels, duplicated OCR noise, or in an unrelated sense (e.g., the different word "Mitarbeit") without addressing employees. Edge cases include abbreviations and concatenations ("Mitarb.", "Mitarbeiterverantwortlich"), mentions of a spouse’s responsibility (relevant only if the intent includes family links to staff), and misspellings or uppercasing — these should be normalized and judged by surrounding context to avoid false positives.</narr>

	<desc>The query seeks German-language measurement instruments and literature on employee-related constructs—especially supervisor–employee communication quality, leadership/LMX, organizational commitment, acculturation, job performance, and customer orientation—along with guidance on interviewer recruitment, training, and quality assurance to minimize interviewer effects.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it centers on employees (Mitarbeiter) and closely related constructs, explicitly using the term or clear variants such as MitarbeiterInnen, Mitarbeitende, or compounds like Mitarbeiterbindung/Mitarbeiterbefragung. Examples of strong relevance include content on leader–employee communication quality, LMX7 from the employee perspective, the OCQ measuring employees’ affective organizational commitment, and customer orientation of service employees. Synonyms or role labels like Untergebene, Beschäftigte, or “employee–supervisor” relationship measures also count, even when framed through leadership or exchange theory. Non-relevant or weakly relevant items are those where “Mitarbeiter” appears only incidentally (e.g., in citations, staff directories) or where the focus is unrelated (e.g., a general acculturation model or interviewer training that mentions staff but is not about employees as a subject). Edge cases include pages focused mainly on supervisors with minimal employee context, gender-inclusive spellings (Mitarbeiter:innen) that should still match, and English-only “employee” content that is topically relevant but may not be retrieved by a strict German keyword match.</narr>

<title>education</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking comparative, research-based insights on how education systems and attainment affect social inequality and life outcomes in Europe, including trends in educational homogamy, stratification, returns to education, and skill mismatches. They also want evidence on policy and institutional responses—such as inclusion, quality assurance, and STEM for SDG 4—and the roles of educators in aligning education with labor market and societal needs.</desc>
	<narr>For the keyword query “education,” a document is relevant when education is a central focus—such as research on schooling systems, teaching and learning processes, educational attainment, policy and governance, or education’s social and economic outcomes. Examples include studies of educational homogamy across European cohorts, returns to education using PIAAC data, national reports on inclusion and quality (e.g., “Bildung in Deutschland”), analyses of STEM for SDG4, or work linking educational expansion to labor market stratification and voter turnout. Documents are less relevant if “education” is only mentioned tangentially (e.g., a passing reference to an Education Act, a funding body named Ministry of Education, or education used solely as a control variable in a study primarily about unrelated outcomes). Useful signals of relevance include repeated, substantive discussion of curricula, pedagogy, higher or vocational education, quality and inequality, or educational institutions, as well as keywords like schooling, learning, teacher training, attainment, or educational policy. Edge cases include domains like “patient education” or marketing portals: these can be relevant if they analyze educational content, delivery, or outcomes, but not if they merely name “education” without engaging with educational processes or systems.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user wants datasets and studies on education that cover both historical public spending and its links to economic growth and contemporary participation in and attitudes toward adult/continuing education. The focus is primarily on Germany (including the former GDR) with international comparisons, and includes surveys on education policy preferences and detailed demographic variables.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant when it substantively addresses education systems, learning participation, or education policy—such as analyses of public expenditure on education (e.g., Germany, France, Spain, Great Britain 1815–1989), surveys of adult and further education (AES 2022), evaluations of distance education, or public preferences for education spending and governance (INVEDUC). Content focused on educational structures and pathways (schooling, vocational training, higher education), lifelong learning and upskilling, teacher professional development, or historically specific systems (e.g., GDR school and higher education data in HISTAT) is also clearly relevant. By contrast, documents are non-relevant if “education” appears only as a demographic attribute (“highest education attained”), a passing mention, or in an organization’s name without substantive analysis of education. Edge cases include mixed-topic surveys or fiscal datasets that cover multiple sectors: they are relevant if they report dedicated education modules or indicators (e.g., education-specific tables, attitudes to further education), but only marginally relevant if education is incidental (e.g., a labor study that merely records schooling or a hobby “self-education” note without links to broader educational behavior).</narr>

	<desc>The user needs standardized classifications of highest education level — including professional/further education and spouse/partner’s highest qualification — for survey coding or analysis. They specifically want country-specific mappings of degree categories for Finland, Taiwan, Ireland, Slovenia, Australia, Russia, the Philippines, Spain, Portugal, and Switzerland (DEGR03/2003 / Education II).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "education" if it explicitly contains variables, questions, or mappings about educational attainment — for example labels like "professional education", "highest education level", "spouse degree highest qualification", or country-specific degree mappings such as DEGR03 for FI, TW, IE, etc. Items that show survey variable codes (v465, v501, DEGREE R, Education II) and repeated question text ("What is your professional education / further education") are strong signals of relevance because they directly encode or ask about qualifications and degrees. A document is non‑relevant if "education" appears only incidentally (e.g., in a generic header), if the text actually refers to unrelated training topics or job titles, or if the codes present map to non‑educational domains — such cases do not provide usable information about attainment levels. Edge cases to watch: duplicated or noisy listings, multilingual or abbreviated labels that obscure meaning, distinctions between respondent vs. spouse education, and dated country‑specific schemas (e.g., 2003) — these require careful interpretation even when the document is broadly about education.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks guidance on how to conceptualize, operationalize, and code educational attainment in German and cross-national surveys, including handling migrants’ foreign qualifications and applying classification schemes like CASMIN, ISCED, or years of education. They also want pointers to validated survey instruments for educational attitudes, aspirations, competencies, and related constructs used in large-scale studies.</desc>
	<narr>This document is relevant to the query “education” because it directly defines and operationalizes education as highest attainment and details how to measure and code it in surveys, including cross-national schemes like CASMIN and ISCED, derivation of years of education, and the handling of migrant qualifications. Highly relevant examples include discussions of mapping German credentials to ISCED/CASMIN, solutions used in SOEP and NEPS, and guidance on choosing between linear, ordinal, or categorical education variables. Content that distinguishes education from competencies or fields of study, and analyses of returns to education, inequality, and educational aspirations/attitudes (when tied to decisions and outcomes) also counts as relevant. However, sections that introduce general psychometric scales (e.g., grit, curiosity, SDO, digital readiness, informal workplace learning) are only tangential unless they explicitly predict or are designed for educational settings or outcomes. Edge cases include documents that merely mention “education” without measurement or policy substance (non-relevant) versus those providing long-term, cross-survey comparability for education variables (e.g., German Microcensuses with ISCED/CASMIN), which are strongly relevant.</narr>

<title>migranten</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking comprehensive research on migrants—mainly in Germany—covering education and labor market integration, health and mortality, media use, political participation, entrepreneurship, public attitudes, rights and policy frameworks, and statistical definitions such as migration background.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “migranten” when it discusses people who are migrants (typically in the German context) and uses the term “Migranten” or close variants, focusing on their education, labor market outcomes, health (e.g., the healthy migrant effect), media use, entrepreneurship, rights, or political participation. Studies comparing migrants with natives (such as FSU, Turkish, or Jewish vs. ethnic German migrants), analyses of integration policy, or reports on “Menschen mit Migrationshintergrund,” “Zuwanderer,” “Spätaussiedler,” or “Migrantinnen und Migranten” also qualify as relevant. Content may be in German or English, and can still be relevant if it centers migrants without the exact keyword, as long as synonyms or group-specific labels are used. Non-relevant documents are those where “migranten” appears only incidentally or in unrelated senses (e.g., IT/data migration, animal/cell migration), brand or project names, or administrative metadata without substantive discussion of migrant people. Edge cases include mixed-language texts, OCR variants, or pieces about other countries that remain relevant if they analyze migrants’ social, economic, or legal situations; conversely, purely methodological papers that mention migrants only in passing would be weakly relevant.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks empirical datasets and studies on migrants, including international migration flows, demographic and occupational profiles, employment before/after migration, and return migration. They also want surveys on integration and public attitudes toward migrants, with emphasis on Germany and comparative international contexts across historical and contemporary periods.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “migranten” if it substantively discusses migrants as people who move across borders, including their demographics (age, sex, education), occupations, integration experiences, or measured flows, and if it presents statistics, surveys, or policies about them. Clear examples include datasets on Arbeitsmigranten in households, national tables of emigrants and immigrants by origin/destination and occupation, or panel studies of second-generation migrants, returnees, and their life-course outcomes. Texts using closely related German terms such as Zuwanderer, Auswanderer, Rückwanderer, Personen mit Migrationshintergrund, or studies of “Migration” that identify individual migrants (e.g., harbor/passport/border statistics distinguishing migrants from travelers) are also relevant. Non-relevant materials include uses of “Migration” in unrelated domains (IT/database migration, animal migration), or documents where “Migranten” is only a passing mention without data or analysis about migrant persons. Edge cases include colonial/intercontinental vs international classifications and “indirect” statistics (e.g., counts by referenced countries); these remain relevant if they quantify or describe migrants, whereas items that list migrants merely as one of many possible target groups without depth are only marginally relevant.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>A need to find or reproduce a survey measuring German public attitudes toward migrants, including items on contact with foreigners, perceived treatment and discrimination, integration (e.g., whether migrants can become “real” Germans), support for Islam instruction in schools, estimates of foreigner share, neighborhood preferences, and views on refugees’ risks or opportunities. The user is looking for the specific questionnaire items and response scales used to assess these attitudes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "migranten" when its main subject is migration or migrants — for example discussions of foreigners or refugees in Germany, public-opinion surveys about "in Deutschland lebende Ausländer", policies on integration or schooling (e.g., Islamunterricht), neighborhood preferences, or measured attitudes and discrimination scales. Concrete signals of relevance include mentions of synonyms like Ausländer, Flüchtlinge, Einwanderer/Zuwanderer, statistics on foreigner percentages, survey items asking about contact with migrants, or instruments showing Likert/scale responses about migrants. A document is non-relevant when the word appears only incidentally or in a different domain — for example IT/database migration, animal migration studies, or a passing quote that doesn’t address people, policy, or public attitudes. Edge cases include German-language materials (which are highly relevant if they discuss migrants), documents that discuss legal status vs cultural assimilation (both can be relevant but for different analytic needs), and methodological survey texts: questionnaires and scale descriptions are relevant even though they are not interpretive analyses. If a text only reports raw demographic counts (e.g., census tables) it is borderline but usually relevant; if it uses "migration" in a metaphorical or technical sense unrelated to human migration, it is not relevant.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The query seeks an overview of how acculturation and educational attainment are measured for migrants in German surveys. It focuses on instruments like AKOrM (adapted from the Vancouver Index of Acculturation), coding strategies for foreign qualifications, alternative response formats and tools, implementations in SOEP and NEPS, and remaining interpretive limitations.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly discusses migrants (e.g., “Migrantinnen und Migranten,” “migrants”) and focuses on their experiences, measurement, or integration, such as acculturation scales, education credentials, or survey methodology. The given paragraph is highly relevant: it repeatedly addresses migrants, details the AKOrM acculturation framework (a German adaptation of the Vancouver Index of Acculturation), and examines how to measure education for people with foreign degrees in German surveys like SOEP and NEPS. Documents about “migration” that do not concern people (e.g., animal migration or internal firm mobility) or that only mention “Migranten” in passing (like a citation) are non-relevant. Edge cases include gendered/plural variants (Migrant, Migranten, Migrantinnen), related labels (refugees, asylum seekers), and German/English terminology; these are relevant if they clearly refer to human migrants in a comparable context. Conversely, content that uses “Migration” as a general methodological term, places the keyword only in metadata, or discusses measurement tools without linking them to migrants should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking academic research on how migrants adapt and integrate in European host societies, especially Germany. They want determinants and outcomes such as social networks, neighborhood composition, language proficiency, rights knowledge, labor market transitions, identity, healthcare practices, and settlement intentions.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it centers on people identified as migrants (or close variants like migrants, migrant workers, immigrants) and analyzes their experiences, determinants, or outcomes. Studies on integration, rights, networks, labor market trajectories, identity, or health care use—e.g., research on migrant–non‑migrant relationships in Germany or on migrant network effects on EU location choices—are strongly relevant. Content that only drops the term in passing, treats migration merely as background, or uses unrelated senses (animal migration or “migrating data”) is weakly relevant or non‑relevant. Edge cases include works about non‑migrants that directly examine their interactions with migrants (still relevant), pieces using related terms like refugees/asylum seekers (often relevant), and subgroup‑specific analyses (FSU migrants, Chinese migrants in Africa) which remain relevant if migrants are the focal actors. Duplicated abstracts, bibliographic lists, or broad overviews with little substantive discussion of migrants’ conditions are borderline, whereas empirical studies, policy analyses, and qualitative accounts that foreground migrants score highest.</narr>

<research_data>
	<desc>Find social science surveys and datasets about migrants and migration, including profiles of migrant workers and their families, migration histories and return, integration experiences, socioeconomic outcomes, and public attitudes toward migrants across countries.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it centers on people who migrate—e.g., migrant workers, emigrants/remigrants, returned migrants, or second-generation migrants—and provides substantive information about their demographics, movements, work, integration, or impacts. Examples include surveys detailing age, education, employment before and during migration, length and type of migration, return timing, household roles of wives of returned migrant workers, and case studies such as small farming families in Zambia, GERPS panels of German emigrants/remigrants, or the 2000 Families study of Turkish migrants. Studies on attitudes toward migrants (xenophobia, discrimination, integration policy), or panels of new immigrants like SCIP, are also clearly relevant because migrants are the focal subject. Non-relevant items would be those where “migration” refers to non-human or technical processes (e.g., data or bird migration) or where migrants are only name-checked without substantive content. Edge cases include documents focused solely on “refugees” or general social conditions: they can be relevant if they explicitly link to migrants or migration experiences, but may be borderline for a strict keyword match on “migrant.”</narr>

They also want a summary of the attitudinal survey item asking respondents whether they agree that migrants send money home to relatives (i.e., public views on remittances) and how that response is recorded.</desc>
	<narr>A document is highly relevant to the query "migrant" when it contains substantive discussion of migration topics such as movement between regions (e.g., "East migrant to the West"), origin/destination details, migrants’ activities (working abroad), or remittances (e.g., "migrants … often send money back to their relatives"). Short survey labels or variable names that explicitly describe migrant-related measures (like "MIGRANTS SENDING BACK MONEY" or descriptions of region-of-origin categories) are also relevant because they indicate measured content about migrants. A document is less relevant when it only contains noisy metadata or repeated variable codes (NeuQ5, v406, NeuJE341) without explanatory text, or when "migrant" appears only as a tag or in passing with no substantive context. Edge cases include passages that mention "without migrants" — these can be relevant if they analyze impacts of migrant absence, but are borderline if they merely list a category name (e.g., "Purely East West without migrants") with no further information.</narr>

They seek approaches for handling foreign qualifications (e.g., classifications, years-of-education, response categories, database tools) and examples from SOEP/NEPS, along with limitations and interpretation issues.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses migrants/immigrants, especially topics like acculturation, measurement of educational attainment, and survey methodology in contexts such as Germany. Strong matches include discussions of acculturation scales (e.g., the Vancouver Index, AKOrM), how surveys code foreign qualifications (German school credentials vs international classifications), derivation of years of education, and applications in datasets like SOEP or NEPS. It is not relevant if “migrant” appears only in passing, is used in an unrelated sense (e.g., migrant birds or data migration), or if education coding is discussed without linking to migrant populations. Edge cases: documents using synonymous terms (immigrants, refugees, asylum seekers) or addressing host-culture adaptation without the exact word “migrant” can still be relevant; material on internal migrants or migrant workers is only partly relevant unless it tackles comparable measurement issues (e.g., credential comparability). German-language sources on these survey tools remain relevant, while mere mentions of SOEP/NEPS without a migrant focus are marginal.</narr>

They want authoritative sources spanning national and global contexts (e.g., Global Compact, EU Pact, trade–migration links, remittances).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it contains the stem “migra” in the context of human migration, such as migration/migrants (EN), migração/imigração/emigração (PT), migración (ES), or Migration (DE), and discusses topics like immigrant integration, asylum, deportation, return programs, or refugee family dynamics. Policy reports and statistical analyses (e.g., an Observatório das Migrações report in Portugal, studies on Eritrean and Syrian refugees in Germany, or EU/German migration pacts) are strong matches because they use the term repeatedly and substantively. Partial or noisy matches such as hyphenated or OCR-split forms (“migra tion”), accent-stripped variants, and prefixes like “imigra-” or “emigra-” should also be treated as relevant. Non-relevant hits include unrelated strings like “migraine/Migra-” medication names, or “data/TV network migration” if the intent is human mobility; these are edge cases that may be excluded unless the query is broadly about any kind of migration. Documents using the colloquial “la migra” for U.S. immigration enforcement are also relevant, even if written in Spanish.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query "migra" likely indicates a need for information about migration — its causes, patterns, and effects (e.g., academic migration, refugee flows, labor migration) — and about empirical sources and surveys used to study these topics. The searcher is probably looking for datasets, study results, or policy and integration information (questions, variables, and measurements) to analyze migration outcomes and public attitudes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "migra" when it centrally addresses migration-related concepts (migration, migrant, immigrat*, emigrat*, remigration, refugee, asylum, mobility) rather than using the letters as an incidental substring. Relevant signals include empirical studies or surveys of movers (e.g., research on Russian academics who migrated to Germany), policy analyses of immigration or asylum, datasets on flows and remittances, or measures of integration and labour mobility; presence of country names, sample sizes, survey methods, or terms like “refugee,” “emigration,” “return migration,” or “integration” strengthens relevance. Non‑relevant documents include those where "migra" appears in unrelated senses (e.g., “migraine,” brand names, or coincidental strings) or where migration is only briefly mentioned in passing; short, single-line mentions or meta-data hits without substantive migration content are low value. Edge cases to watch: internal mobility studies (moving within a country), digitization-driven mobility, or non‑English sources using the stem (migra-, migración, migrazione) can be relevant if the topical context is migration, so check surrounding context (abstract, keywords, methods, population) to confirm true relevance.</narr>

It asks whether people expect significant or limited migration from Eastern and Central Europe to the respondent’s country, whether that is positive or negative (and why), plus agree/disagree responses to statements about immigration and immigrants.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "migra" when it discusses human migration, migrants, or migration-related survey variables—for example, the paragraph’s variable codes (1 = purely West, 3 = West migrant to the East) and the EU-enlargement questions about people moving from Eastern and Central Europe clearly match the intent. Relevant examples include survey documentation, questionnaire text about immigration attitudes, or analyses of East–West migration flows. Non-relevant documents merely containing the substring "migra" but about other topics—e.g., "migraine," "migratory birds," or an unrelated acronym "MIGRA"—should be excluded. Edge cases include short or ambiguous mentions (a lone variable name "migra" without context), foreign-language uses or slang ("la migra" referring to immigration enforcement), and documents that list variable codes but lack substantive migration content; for those, check surrounding words like "migration," "migrants," "EU enlargement," "East," "West," or "survey" to confirm relevance.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "migra" when it substantively discusses migration or migrants — for example items about "Migrationshintergrund," immigration and integration surveys (Mikrozensus, RESPOND), acculturation and identity scales, asylum-seeker questionnaires, or psychometric instruments and codebooks (SAS/SPSS/Stata) used to typify migration background. Strong signals of relevance include detailed methodology, questionnaire items, sample languages (e.g. Arabic, Farsi, Russian), validation statistics, or explicit focus on immigrant populations, whereas a single passing use of the word "migration" or a brief metadata tag is weak evidence. Non-relevant documents include cases where "migra" appears only as part of an unrelated word (e.g. "migraine"), a brand name, an unrelated acronym (MIGRA), or discussions of biological/animal migration with no human migration context. Edge cases to watch for are multilingual uses like Spanish "la migra" (immigration enforcement), internal versus international migration distinctions, or very short mentions that require more context — in those cases require additional topical content before labeling the document relevant.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks an academic overview of Muslims in Germany and Europe, including youth socialization, religiosity, and community organization. It synthesizes research on attitudes toward and among Muslims (e.g., antisemitism and Islamophobia), media portrayals, right‑populist mobilization, and state–church policy frameworks across countries.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses Muslims (e.g., Muslime, Muslimen, Musliminnen, Muslim:innen, muslimisch) as a social or religious group, including studies of their attitudes, religiosity, discrimination/Islamophobia, organization, demographics, or policy debates in Germany or Europe. Examples include empirical analyses of antisemitic attitudes among Muslims by origin or religiosity, surveys comparing Muslims and Christians, research on anti-Muslim prejudice and right-populist mobilization, historical accounts of Muslim communities (e.g., Bosnia, Romania, Russia, Austria), and media or citizenship-policy studies that center Muslims. Variants and spellings using inclusive German (Muslim innen) or English equivalents (“Muslims”), as well as adjectival forms (muslimisch) and related terms (antimuslimisch, Islamfeindlichkeit), also signal relevance when Muslims are the focal category. Non-relevant items would treat Islam purely as abstract theology without engaging Muslims as people, mention “Muslim” only in passing or as a surname, or focus on other groups unless Muslims are a main point of comparison. Edge cases include media analyses that discuss “Islam” but clearly evaluate portrayals of Muslims, and cross-national surveys where few Muslims live yet attitudes toward Muslims drive hypotheses—both are still relevant.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking social science surveys and datasets about Muslims, focusing on public attitudes toward Muslims and Islam, Islamophobia, interreligious contact, integration, identity, and discrimination, mainly in Germany and Europe. They want empirical measures alongside demographics and political views to analyze these topics.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “muslime” if it contains substantive information about Muslims, such as attitudes toward Muslims, contact with Muslim neighbors or coworkers, measures of Islamophobia, policies or opinions about Muslim immigrants, or demographics of Muslim populations. Examples include survey modules on “Respekt/Sympathie für Muslime,” “Gefühl der Fremdheit wegen der vielen Muslime,” headscarf policies, “Nachbarschaft ohne Muslime bevorzugt,” implicit attitude tests toward Muslims, or variables distinguishing Muslim religious affiliation. Content in broader interfaith or immigration studies is also relevant when Muslims are an explicitly analyzed subgroup (e.g., interreligious contact with Muslim and Christian participants in Togo/Sierra Leone, or European opinions on Muslim immigrants), and language or morphological variants (Muslime, Muslimen, muslimische, MuslimInnen) count. A document is non-relevant if it discusses religion or migration only in general terms without Muslim-specific measures, or mentions Muslims only in passing (e.g., a brief note about papal meetings) without analytic detail. Edge cases include geographically outside-Germany contexts (still relevant if Muslims are a focus) and tangential mentions that become relevant only when tied to concrete variables, outcomes, or policy stances about Muslims.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A request to measure public perceptions of Muslims, especially regarding integration in Germany (e.g., acceptance of other religions, obedience to German law, preference for social separation, and perceived threat). It also seeks estimates (0–100 scale) of how widespread various opinions are among Muslims living in Germany and in Arab countries.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "muslime" when it substantively discusses Muslims or public attitudes toward Muslims — for example survey questionnaires, opinion-poll results, sociological studies, news stories about Muslim communities in Germany or Arab countries, or policy analyses of integration and legal obligations. The paragraph you supplied, which contains repeated survey items asking how people perceive Muslims in Germany and Arab countries (e.g., whether they follow German law, accept other religions, or prefer to keep to themselves), is clearly relevant because it directly addresses those themes. A document is non-relevant if the term appears only fleetingly or in a different sense (for instance as a username, a brand name, or a transcription error), or if the piece is about an unrelated topic that merely mentions "Muslime" in passing. Edge cases include noisy or repetitive transcripts — even with duplication or transcription artifacts they remain relevant if they contain the survey content or substantive statements about Muslims, whereas materials that reproduce stereotypes or hate speech without analysis may be relevant but require careful handling or content warnings.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking information about a German research project that cognitively pretested a multilingual survey on religious identification, Islamist fundamentalist attitudes, and experiences with extremism among Muslim adolescents in Germany, including its methods and translations.</desc>
	<narr>The query “muslime” is a German plural term for Muslims, so documents are relevant when they explicitly discuss Muslims as a group or individuals, their communities, attitudes, demographics, or experiences (including gendered/plural forms like “Musliminnen und Muslime”). The provided paragraph is relevant because it focuses on Muslim youth in Germany and examines their religious identification and attitudes, even if the specific angle is on Islamist and fundamentalist views within that population. Content that only discusses “Islam” abstractly without referring to Muslims, or that treats extremism generically without specifying Muslim groups, would be less relevant, as would texts where “Muslime” appears only in a citation, keyword list, or translation note. Edge cases include morphological variants and capitalization in German (Muslime/Musliminnen/Muslimen), related languages (e.g., “Muslims” in English), and false positives like references to “muslin” (the fabric) or brand names that coincidentally contain the string.</narr>

<title>mobilität</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking a comprehensive overview of mobility—especially spatial and job-related mobility in Europe/Germany—covering forms such as multilocal living, commuting/relocation, and virtual mobility. They want determinants and infrastructures as well as documented impacts on family life, careers, social integration, health, and regional/urban development.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it treats mobility as a core topic—for example spatial mobility linked to multilocal living (commuting, weekend commuting, residential moves), job-related mobility in Europe and its impacts on family life and careers, academic mobility, or virtual mobility and its relationship to physical movement. Empirical evidence such as long travel distances, high car use, EU cross-country surveys, life-course analyses of regional moves after training, or studies of children’s and students’ mobility strongly signals relevance. Theoretical treatments (e.g., referencing Simmel, Giddens, Urry) that conceptualize mobility/immobility, infrastructures that enable movement, and the interplay between social and spatial mobility are also pertinent even if the exact term appears sparingly. Non-relevant items use “Mobilität” only in passing, solely in citations, or in unrelated senses (e.g., mobile phones/IT data mobility) without implications for human or social movement. Edge cases include works on the mobility of goods/ideas or pure infrastructure specifications; these count only when explicitly framed within mobility studies or linked to human outcomes.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking research and survey-based information on “Mobilität” in both senses: social/occupational mobility (inter- and intragenerational, sectoral, regional) and transport/commuting behavior. They want definitions and typologies, determinants and impacts (careers, wellbeing, integration), and public attitudes and policy measures (e.g., e-mobility, public transport), with emphasis on Germany and Europe.</desc>
	<narr>For the query “mobilität,” documents are relevant if they explicitly address mobility in any German sense—transport/mobility behavior (commuting, mode choice, e-mobility), occupational or job mobility (career moves, sector switches, relocations), regional/geographical mobility (migration, urban–rural moves), or social/intergenerational mobility—using the term or close variants like E‑Mobilität, berufliche/regionale Mobilität, or Jobmobilität. Highly relevant examples include surveys of car commuters’ behavior and attitudes to future mobility, studies of inter- and intragenerational occupational mobility, EU labor mobility within the single market, or datasets measuring commuting distance/time, overnight work travel, and job-related moves. Historical or local studies that analyze vertical mobility between parents’ and children’s occupations, or city surveys where mobility is a core topic among others, are also relevant. Non-relevant items would be texts where “Mobilität” is merely a passing tag with no substantive analysis, or where the string matches unrelated topics (e.g., Immobilien/property, “Immobilität”/immobility, mobile phones). Edge cases include documents using synonyms like Pendeln or räumliche/soziale Durchlässigkeit without the exact keyword, or pieces mixing several mobility types; these are relevant if mobility is central rather than incidental.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is asking about mobility limitations — imagining future age- or accident-related loss of movement — and how this would affect preferred housing choices and the need for assistance. They want to know whether they would require temporary or long-term help with daily activities (personal care, eating, mobility/ambulation, and household tasks) due to illness, disability, or age.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "mobilität" if it discusses personal physical mobility and its consequences — for example preferred housing when one’s Bewegungsfreiheit is eingeschränkt, questions about Hilfs- oder Pflegebedürftigkeit, or needs for help with daily living tasks (Körperpflege, Ernährung, Mobilität, hauswirtschaftliche Versorgung). Survey items like the repeated questionnaire text in the paragraph, descriptions of accessibility features, assistive devices, adaptations to dwellings, or assessments of long‑term care needs are clear positive signals. Non‑relevant documents mention "mobility" in other senses (transportation policy, workforce or social mobility, semiconductor electron mobility) or only use the word briefly without relating it to personal care, housing or ADLs. Borderline cases include texts that use "mobilität" in relation to moving house or short‑term travel — these may be partially relevant if they explicitly address movement restrictions or care needs, but irrelevant if they only discuss logistics or abstract concepts.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking information on spatial mobility (migration) in the German Microcensus panel and how movers in/out of sampling areas create sample selectivity that can bias longitudinal analyses. They may also want methods or example programs (e.g., LEM) to assess and correct this bias.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it discusses mobility in the sense of spatial movement of people—e.g., households moving out of or into sampling areas—and how this affects data, such as selection bias or attrition in longitudinal surveys (terms like räumliche Mobilität, wegziehen, zuziehen, Flächenstichprobe, Auswahlbezirke, Stichprobenselektivität, Mikrozensuspanel signal strong relevance). Content analyzing movers vs. stayers, in-/out-migration, or panel replacement due to relocation directly addresses the query. It is non-relevant if “Mobilität” refers to unrelated domains like transport policy/e-mobility, mobile technologies, or purely social/educational mobility without any spatial movement component. Edge cases include studies on educational trajectories that only mention mobility tangentially (weakly relevant), and methodological texts that do not use the word “Mobilität” but clearly describe the consequences of respondents moving; the latter can still be relevant if the movement and its effects are explicit. Mentions of the term only in citations or titles, without substantive discussion in the body, are not sufficient.</narr>

<title>motivation</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks scholarly research on motivation and motives across diverse contexts (education, work, public service, religion, activism, sports, compliance, and online collaboration). They want determinants, measurement (e.g., intrinsic/extrinsic, affective contingencies), and effects of motivation on behavior and performance, with practical implications for management and policy.</desc>
	<narr>For the query “motivation,” documents are relevant when they explicitly analyze motivation or motives, describe motivational constructs (e.g., intrinsic vs. extrinsic, public service motivation), or examine how motivation is measured, shaped, or linked to outcomes. Studies that test predictors or consequences of motivation in concrete domains—such as teacher work motivation affecting student learning, motive-specific affective contingencies measured via EMG, peer motivational climate predicting exercise enjoyment, or contributors’ motives in platforms like OpenStreetMap—are clearly relevant, as are typologies of motives (e.g., protesters’ or church–mission relationships) and taxonomies grounded in theory. Method-focused work that operationalizes motivation with validated instruments or models (factor analysis, regression, structural equations), or that distinguishes “motivation” from related traits and values, also counts. By contrast, pieces where “motivation” appears only in passing, is used as a generic buzzword, or refers to unrelated senses (e.g., a “motivation letter” template, “motive power” in engineering, or collections of motivational quotes without analysis) are non-relevant. Edge cases like criminological “motives” for noncompliance or justice motives are relevant if they systematically analyze reasons for behavior, whereas performance or policy papers that discuss outcomes without linking them to motives or motivational processes are not.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks surveys and datasets examining motivation, motives, and related attitudes across many life domains (e.g., abortion counseling, education and career choice, migration, military service, leisure and museum visits, language learning, gaming, drug use, leadership, residential moves), mainly in German/European contexts. They want information on topics covered, measurement scales, and demographics to analyze how motivation shapes decisions, behavior, and well-being.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it centers on human motivation or motives—defining, measuring, or analyzing why people act—such as studies of intrinsic/extrinsic work motivation, achievement motivation, motivational action conflicts and interference in learning, or domain-specific motives like emigration, vocational choice, abortion counseling decisions, museum or forest trip reasons, drug use motives, and gaming motivations. Relevance is strongest when motivation is a primary construct with operationalized measures or scales (e.g., Luhmann–Mayntz, Schenk, militarism/affinity scales) and when it links motives to behaviors, outcomes, or well-being. Documents are non-relevant if they only mention “motivation” in passing among many topics without analysis, or if they use the term differently (e.g., letters of motivation for applications, legal “motive” in a non-psychological sense, or mechanical/engineering terms). Synonyms like “motives,” “reasons for,” “drivers,” and “incentives,” and constructs like work attitude that clearly index motivation count toward relevance; purely demographic or procedural descriptions of surveys without motivational items or findings are borderline. Edge cases include broad multi-topic datasets: they are relevant if they include explicit items or results about motives (e.g., reasons for learning languages or returning from abroad), but not if they only report logistics, coding schemes, or unrelated attitudes.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>User seeks to know which incentives or assurances would encourage people to take part in public discussions about the future of Europe (e.g., being taken seriously, anonymity, access to information, same language, etc.). They also want to identify main motivations for learning additional foreign languages (e.g., work or study abroad, better job, travel/holidays, meeting people, heritage, internet use, personal satisfaction).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "motivation" when it explicitly records reasons, incentives or barriers that would make someone take part in an activity (e.g., public discussions) or learn another language. For example, responses that say "being certain my views are taken seriously," "anonymity," "access to information," or "same language" directly capture motivations for joining public debates, while labels like "nothing" or "don't know" also count as meaningful (they indicate no or unclear motivation). For language learning, relevant documents list concrete motives such as "better job," "study abroad," "holiday/travel," "meet people," "heritage," "personal satisfaction," or using the Internet to learn. Non-relevant documents lack motivational content—pure metadata, admin codes, unrelated survey modules, or repeated question stems with no answer give no insight into motivation. Edge cases include files that only contain variable names or the substring "motiv" (these can be useful if they map to response labels) and responses that state "nothing" or "know enough," which are relevant but indicate absence of motivation rather than a positive driver.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks an overview of how motivation is conceptualized and measured in social science surveys, including key validated scales (achievement/performance motivation, self-efficacy, need for cognition, empathy, environmental and intercultural motives). They also want practical guidance on motivating participation (interviewer selection/training, postal survey design) and minimizing response biases.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it treats motivation as a psychological driver of behavior, measures motivational constructs, or details strategies to motivate participants (e.g., in surveys). Clear examples include scales of achievement/performance motivation (hope of success, fear of failure), cognitive motivation such as Need for Cognition, self-efficacy in motivational contexts, motivated empathy, motives for intercultural contact, environmental action motivation, and status-maintenance motives. Methods content is also relevant when it focuses on motivating respondents or interviewers to participate and respond (e.g., cover letters, interviewer training), or when response biases are explicitly linked to motivational processes like satisficing. By contrast, material that only catalogs response-bias types, general survey operations, or workload measures without a substantive motivational link would be non-relevant, as would mere name-drops of “motivation” without analysis. Edge cases include constructs with motivational theory in the background but a non-motivational focus (borderline), whereas inventories labeled “motivations” that operationalize tendencies like avoidance or revenge remain relevant because they measure motivational dispositions.</narr>

<title>beruf</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks scholarly information on occupations in Germany, emphasizing how gender shapes occupational choice, employment/unemployment, part-time work, training pathways, and prestige. They also want insights on occupational classification and standardization, labor market projections, and trends in IT, social, green, and knowledge-intensive professions.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it meaningfully discusses occupations/professions (der Beruf/die Berufe) or closely related constructs and uses the keyword or clear morphological variants (beruflich, Berufs-, Berufsausbildung, IT‑Berufe) in a substantive way. Examples of relevant content include analyses of gender segregation across occupations, dual vocational training, employment/unemployment by profession, prestige dynamics as female shares rise, occupational standardization (e.g., Berufsordnung, certification), or systems like ISCO and BERUFENET. Texts can also be relevant without the exact token “Beruf” if the core topic is the occupation concept (e.g., employment stability by profession, duration of family-related career interruptions by occupation, “green” or knowledge‑intensive occupations). Non‑relevant material would use the word only in passing or in unrelated senses (e.g., metaphorical/religious “Berufung,” legal “Berufung”/appeal, or compounds like Berufsverkehr/commuter traffic) without discussing occupations. Edge cases include English or mixed-language documents using “profession/occupation/job” that clearly target the same concept, and lists or datasets of job titles—these count if they enumerate or analyze occupations, but not if “Beruf” appears only in a header with no occupational content.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking sociological studies and datasets on occupations in Germany (Beruf), including vocational training, career trajectories, professionalization, licensing/occupational closure, and occupational prestige. The focus spans pre- and post-reunification periods and related themes such as social networks, mobility, job satisfaction, and demographics.</desc>
	<narr>The query “beruf” is the German term for occupation/profession, so a document is relevant if it discusses jobs, careers, training, licensing/regulation, or occupational status using “Beruf” or clear variants such as berufs-, beruflich, Berufe, Berufsbezeichnung, Berufszufriedenheit. Examples of strong relevance include surveys of flight attendants’ career orientation and job satisfaction, longitudinal work biographies around the Wende, indices of occupational closure/licensing, or intergenerational mobility studies that record “Beruf des Vaters/Mutter.” Non-relevant cases include occurrences where “beruf” only appears inside unrelated words or contexts (e.g., Berufung/academic appointment, Berufsverkehr/rush hour), as a name/code, or without substantive discussion of occupations. Edge cases to consider are hyphenated compounds split across lines (Berufs-), OCR or spacing artifacts (Beruf s), capitalization differences, and English texts about occupations that are conceptually relevant but may not match the exact German token. Lists or metadata that merely enumerate the word are only marginally relevant, whereas detailed questionnaires or datasets specifying occupational variables are clearly relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for guidance and survey wording about "Beruf" (occupation): how to report current or most recent occupation, the occupations of father and grandfathers, the respondent’s job status/position, questions on combining work and family, and how to compare the occupational status with that of the father at age 15.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "beruf" if it contains substantive content about occupations or professional status — for example survey questions asking "Welchen Beruf haben Sie zuletzt ausgeübt?", descriptions of someone's current or last job, questions about the father's or grandfathers' occupations, or discussion of work–family compatibility and "Stellung im Beruf." Explicit phrases in the paragraph such as "Beruf des Vaters," "Zur Zeit ausgeübter Beruf," "Beruf und Familie," and forms of berufstätig/beruflicher Status are strong signals of relevance. Non-relevant items are entries that only include the string "Beruf" in codes, index headings, file labels, repeated OCR fragments, or page references (e.g. "v238 S.6" or "V206 VEREINB. FAMILIE BERUF") without substantive text about jobs. Borderline cases include specialized terms like "Berufsstellung des HVV" (which may be relevant only if the user seeks that organization or a legal/regulatory meaning) and metadata tags such as "VEREINB. FAMILIE BERUF" that suggest topical relevance but require inspection of the actual content to confirm.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks guidance on coding and classifying occupations for social research, including mapping between German KldB and ISCO systems and deriving socio-economic status/prestige measures (e.g., MPS, ISEI, ESeC, SIPOS, Blossfeld). They want practical instructions, tools, and survey applications for coding methods and related scales (e.g., commitment, BOKX) in German and European contexts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it treats Beruf (occupation/profession) as a core topic, especially in German contexts such as occupational coding, classification, or measurement. Clear signals include discussion of systems like ISCO-68/08 and KldB 2010, prestige/status indices (MPS, ISEI, SIPOS), class schemes (ESeC/EGP, Blossfeld), survey instruments (BIBB-BAuA, Mikrozensus), and psychometric scales for occupational commitment or the Berufs- und Organisationsklima Index (BOKX). It also counts as relevant when the term appears in German compounds or inflected forms—e.g., Berufe, beruflich, Berufsangaben, Berufscodierung—especially when tied to methods (manual/automatic coding), recoding syntax (SPSS), or validation studies. Non-relevant cases include incidental or purely bibliographic mentions, uses of similarly spelled but different concepts (Berufung/berufen = appointment/calling), or content about “profession/occupation” only in English without the German keyword when exact-term matching is required. Edge cases: mappings between KldB and ISCO or coding software are relevant even if “Beruf” appears mostly in compounds, while labor-market analyses using only numeric occupational codes may be borderline unless their focus on occupations is explicit.</narr>

<title>links rechts</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks research on the meaning, evolution, and measurement of the “left–right” political spectrum in Germany, including public understanding, party positioning, and comparative context. They want to know how social-structural and demographic factors (e.g., education, age, region) shape interpretations and whether the schema still functions as a useful heuristic.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly treats Links–Rechts as the political left–right schema—defining or measuring it (e.g., 0=links to 10=rechts scales), tracing how the meanings of “links” (social equality, new social movements) and “rechts” (conservatism, traditionalism, extremism) change over time, or analyzing who associates which contents with these labels across education, region, and age. Studies using German survey data (ALLBUS, GLES), correspondence/topic analyses of open-ended associations, or cross-national comparisons of the Links–Rechts dimension are strong matches, as are pieces positioning parties or voters along that axis. Methodological discussions that assess the heuristic value or conceptualization of Links–Rechts (e.g., accuracy of party placements, multi-dimensional models) are also relevant. Non-relevant are uses where “links/rechts” means physical direction, handedness, web “links,” or legal “rights,” or where the terms appear only in passing without engaging the political dimension. Edge cases include work on left–right visual scale effects or symbolic hand hierarchies; these are only pertinent if the query targets semantics or measurement of the Links–Rechts schema rather than political ideology per se.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking datasets and survey measures on the left–right (Links–Rechts) ideological spectrum—self-placement, party placement, and definitions—primarily in German political surveys (e.g., ALLBUS, GIP) and related historical/comparative studies. The goal is to analyze voter behavior, party competition, and political attitudes using left–right scales.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “links rechts” when it explicitly treats the left–right political spectrum, for example by measuring Left–Right self-placement, positioning parties on a Left–Right scale, or collecting definitions of what “links” and “rechts” mean (e.g., ALLBUS 2008 open-ended questions F029/F030, or GIP modules rating CDU/CSU, SPD, FDP, Die Linke, Die Grünen, AfD on a Left–Right continuum). Material that uses Left–Right as an analytical dimension in election studies, panel surveys, party manifestos, or datasets with variables like “Links Rechts Selbsteinschätzung,” “Links Rechts Einstufung der Parteien,” or “Links Rechts Verständnis” is highly relevant. Documents are non-relevant if “links” and “rechts” refer only to physical directions, hyperlinks, or unrelated legal terms (Recht), or if the terms appear merely as passing labels without substantive analysis or measurement. Edge cases include school or youth surveys that mention “left/right” groups or images but still include a Left–Right self-placement scale (relevant), and metadata lists where “Links Rechts” appears only as a tag without corresponding variables or questions (likely not relevant). Studies that operationalize adjacent constructs (e.g., liberal–authoritarian) may be borderline unless they also map or anchor them to a Left–Right continuum.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The query seeks survey/questions wording about political self-placement on a left–right ideological scale (e.g., 0–10 or 1–11) and related bipolar items asking respondents to rate how left or right certain attributes apply, including comparisons between East and West Germans. The information need is to find or understand survey items that measure respondents' ideological position and perceptions of regional political/cultural differences.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it clearly contains German survey or questionnaire content about political self-placement on a left–right spectrum — e.g., it uses the terms "links" and "rechts" together with words like "Selbsteinstufung", "Einstufung", "Kontinuum", explicit scales (0–10, 1–11), response instructions ("Bitte kreuzen", "Bitte markieren") or variable IDs (V775, V210, etc.). Good examples are codebooks, survey questionnaires or dataset entries that ask "Where would you place yourself on a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = left, 10 = right)?" or bipolar adjective grids comparing Ost/West Germans. Non-relevant documents mention "links" and "rechts" in other senses (physical directions, hyperlinks/links, legal terms, neurological left/right brain, or surnames) or only incidental occurrences with no political scale or self-placement context. Edge cases include noisy or duplicated texts: repeated variable codes and question fragments are still relevant if the core left–right self-placement question appears, but pages that only list variable names without question wording or that mix languages without clear political context are less useful.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The query seeks standardized survey measures and methodological guidance on left–right political orientation, attitudes to income inequality/redistribution (PAWCER), citizenship and work-permit items in Germany, poverty metrics using the German Microcensus, and the B-RWA-6 right-wing authoritarianism short scale. The goal is to find validated items, pretest evidence, and calculation tools to ensure comparability and robust analysis across studies.</desc>
	<narr>The query “links rechts” most likely targets the German Links-Rechts-Skala, i.e., measures of left–right political self-placement. A document is relevant if it defines, uses, or evaluates this scale (e.g., survey items asking respondents to place themselves on a left–right continuum), discusses methodological testing such as cognitive interviews, or links substantive attitudes (like redistribution or welfare-state views) explicitly to left–right placement. Content focused solely on other topics—citizenship/rights and work permits, poverty measurement with the Mikrozensus, or an authoritarianism scale (RWA)—is non-relevant unless it directly connects those constructs to a left–right self-placement measure. RWA may be only tangentially relevant: it measures right-wing authoritarianism, not the left–right continuum, unless the study maps RWA scores onto a left–right scale. Edge cases include variant spellings (Links-Rechts, links–rechts, LR scale) or English equivalents (“left-right scale”), and documents where “links/rechts” appears as physical directions or “Links” as hyperlinks and “Rechts” as legal rights, which should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>

The user seeks evidence on its correlates and dynamics—class status, deprivation, values, party and regional patterns, youth interpretations, and survey measurement effects.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it analyzes, constructs, validates, or substantively applies the political Left–Right scale (Links-Rechts Skala) as a measure of ideology, self-placement, or party positions. Clear examples include studies using ALLBUS or ESS data to relate Left–Right self-placement to class consciousness, perceived deprivation, or party convergence; work distinguishing general, economic, and socio-cultural Left–Right dimensions; or papers showing divergence between Left–Right self-placement and value-based indices. Methodological pieces that probe measurement issues—such as LISREL validation of scale structure, reliability across samples, or response biases from left-to-right versus right-to-left visual scale layouts—are also relevant. Non-relevant are documents where “links/rechts” denote spatial directions or legal rights, or where the Left–Right variable appears only as a minor control without substantive interpretation (e.g., a citizen-participation study that merely reports a nonsignificant Left–Right coefficient). Edge cases include discrimination or “Gastarbeiter” scales: they are relevant if the link to political Left–Right orientation is explicitly analyzed, and historical vote-mapping studies qualify if they operationalize an ideological Left–Right scale rather than using the terms loosely.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is looking for datasets and documentation on the Left–Right (Links-Rechts) political scale, including measures of voter self-placement and party positions. They want sources that code EU/German election manifestos and surveys into left-right placements and related indices/coding schemes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly measures or codes political positions on a left–right scale, for example by including variables like “Selbsteinstufung auf einem Links–Rechts Kontinuum,” “Links–Rechts Einstufung der Parteien (11-point scale),” or “Euromanifesto placement on a Links–Rechts Skala.” It also counts as relevant when it derives indices from such coding (e.g., left–right positions computed from manifesto codes or EMCS/Klingemann–Volkens measures) or discusses methodology for left–right scaling across surveys or party manifestos. Documents are non-relevant if they only mention “links” and “rechts” as political camps or as directions without a scale, or if they feature other scales (liberal–authoritarian, pro/anti–EU) without a left–right dimension. Edge cases include reversed phrasing like “Rechts–Links Skala,” synonymous wording such as “left–right continuum” or “Skalometer,” and items about left- versus right-wing violence that lack a numeric placement—these are relevant only if a scale-based placement is present. Examples of clearly relevant content include datasets that code party manifestos for 1979–2004/2009 on a left–right scale and surveys that ask respondents to place themselves and parties on 0–10 or 11-point left–right scales.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for survey question wording and scale formats for measuring political ideology on a left–right continuum. Specifically, they want examples of items asking respondents to place themselves or political parties on numeric scales (e.g., 0–10 or 1–11) from left to right.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it includes German survey items asking respondents to place themselves or specific parties (e.g., AfD, SPD, GRÜNE, FDP, CDU, CSU) on a left–right numeric scale, especially when it reproduces scale anchors like 0–10 or 1–11 and variable IDs (V775, V260, pa22, pa25, etc.). Typical relevant sources are questionnaire forms, dataset codebooks, survey instrument descriptions or data files that show the exact wording, response scales, and party-list items. Documents are not relevant when "links" and "rechts" are used as physical directions, hyperlinks, legal terms, or when the text discusses politics only qualitatively without a numeric left–right self-placement or party-placement scale. Edge cases include German-language analyses that describe the concept without reproducing the scale (borderline), translations into other languages (less directly relevant), or instruments using a different ideological axis (e.g., libertarian–authoritarian) — these may be partially relevant but score lower unless they match the exact scale, parties, or variable codes.</narr>

	<desc>The user is looking for information on the Left–Right political orientation scale (Links-Rechts Skala), including its purpose, standard survey wording/response format, and use in studies (e.g., PAWCER) to measure ideological self-placement and related attitudes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly discusses the Left–Right political self-placement measure (Links-Rechts Skala), including its question wording, response range (e.g., 0–10 or 1–7), validation or pretesting (such as cognitive interviews), or its use in surveys like PAWCER or AUTNES. It also counts as relevant if it connects left–right placement to related attitudes (e.g., income inequality/redistribution) while keeping the Left–Right scale itself central to the analysis. Documents that primarily describe other instruments—such as authoritarianism or Law-and-Order scales, Machiavellianism, social desirability, procrastination, the “Oben–Unten” social ladder, or job performance—without detailing the Left–Right measure are non-relevant. Edge cases to exclude include uses of “links”/“rechts” as spatial directions, hyperlinks/UI navigation, or “left–right” referring to handedness or other non-political dimensions. Mentions of citizenship or work-permit items are only relevant if they are explicitly used to validate, stratify, or interpret results of the Left–Right scale.</narr>

<title>immigration</title>
<publication>
	<desc>Seeks research on how immigration policy frameworks and immigrant composition influence public attitudes toward immigration and immigrants’ socioeconomic and political integration. Emphasizes cross-national evidence (e.g., EU, Germany, Australia, Canada, U.S.) on labor market impacts, welfare/crime perceptions, media framing, and governance.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “immigration” when it substantively analyzes immigration policy, immigrant inflows, integration, or attitudes toward immigrants, rather than merely mentioning the term in passing. For example, studies comparing Australia and Germany’s immigration policies and their effects on public attitudes, analyses of EU8 inflows into Germany’s labor market, or work on the overcriminalization of immigration enforcement clearly qualify, as do surveys on immigrant integration (Eurobarometer), media framing of immigration, and skill and wage outcomes of immigrants in Canada. Content centered on “immigrants” (e.g., second-generation effects, family support, anti-discrimination policy impacts, immigrant-origin voter turnout) is typically relevant because it addresses consequences or perceptions of immigration, even if the word “immigration” is not the sole focus. Documents would be non-relevant if “immigration” appears only as a stray keyword, is used metaphorically or in unrelated domains (e.g., internal migration, data “migration”), or if the discussion is purely about emigration without a receiving-society angle. This paragraph is highly relevant because it repeatedly and directly examines immigration across policy, labor markets, culture, crime, welfare, media, and governance with concrete country cases and empirical findings.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks empirical surveys and datasets on immigration and integration in Germany and Europe, including public attitudes, policy preferences (asylum, deportation, skilled-worker migration), discrimination, and integration outcomes. It emphasizes study designs, sampling, and demographic variables to enable comparative and longitudinal analysis.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “immigration” if it substantively addresses migration flows, asylum/refugee issues, immigrant integration, public attitudes or policy on immigration, or datasets/surveys focused on migrant populations and their experiences. Examples include panel surveys tracking new immigrants’ integration (e.g., ENTRA, SCIP), opinion polls on deportation vs. toleration, criteria for skilled worker entry, or welcoming culture (e.g., Verian and infratest dimap studies), cross‑EU studies on discrimination of migrants (EU MIDIS II), and coding of party positions or manifestos on immigration restrictions and multiculturalism. Methodological descriptions are relevant when they pertain to immigrant samples, sampling via registers/onomastics, CAWI/CATI/CAPI modes, or historical migration statistics (e.g., Canada inflows), because they enable analysis of immigration phenomena. A document is non‑relevant if immigration appears only tangentially within a broader topic (e.g., environment, rail services, consumer protection) without substantive immigration content, or if “integration” refers to non-human contexts (like software). Edge cases include security/terrorism or crime topics that are relevant only when explicitly tied to asylum or immigrant policy debates, and studies of children of immigrants or general political surveys that are relevant only when they include specific immigration items or migrant subsamples.</narr>

	<desc>A user is looking for survey questions or public‑opinion measures about attitudes toward immigrants, covering acceptance and perceived impacts — cultural assimilation, effects on the economy and jobs, crime, illegal immigration — and opinions about immigrants from specific regions (EU, Eastern Europe, south of the Mediterranean) and asylum seekers.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant when it contains survey items, variable codes, or question text about public attitudes toward immigrants—especially the explicit Q9/qa9 items (e.g., “Q9a Immigrants increase crime rates,” “qa9 1 positive for nat economy,” “Q9e undermines culture”) or origin-specific variables (v317/v318/v316/v315 referencing EU, Eastern European, South‑of‑Mediterranean immigrants or asylum seekers). Relevant examples include interview scripts asking “How much do you agree or disagree…”, multiple‑choice items about whether immigrants should retain or adopt COUNTRY’s culture, and statements about jobs, welfare, crime, culture, illegal immigration, or economic impact. Non‑relevant documents mention “immigration” only tangentially (e.g., historical migration flows, animal migration, pure demographic counts) or focus on policy/legal text without attitudinal questions; duplicates, formatting noise, or unrelated “R’s country” placeholders with no survey content are low value. Edge cases: translated or templated forms that use placeholders like COUNTRY or R can still be highly relevant if they reproduce the exact Q9/qa9 wording or variable codes, whereas pieces that discuss crime statistics without connecting them to opinions about immigrants are borderline. Documents containing multiple matching items or the original variable codes and full question wording should be scored highest for relevance.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “immigration” if it analyzes immigrants or immigration policy, measurement, or outcomes—for example, classifying “immigrant background” in the German Microcensus, evaluating costs and benefits of immigrants to Germany, or detailing how surveys capture the education of people with foreign qualifications. Methodological content tied to immigration, such as SAS/SPSS/Stata routines to derive immigrant status from 2005–2009 Microcensus data, or discussions of SOEP/NEPS instruments for coding foreign educational attainment, is also clearly relevant. By contrast, materials that discuss education coding only within the German system without addressing migrants, or that cover internal mobility or “migration” in a non-demographic sense (e.g., data/system migration), are non-relevant. Edge cases include documents using synonyms like “migration and integration” or “foreign-born” (still relevant), or focusing on emigration rather than immigration (likely less relevant unless framed in a comparative migration context). Mentions of software or statistics are relevant only if they specifically serve to identify or analyze immigrant populations and outcomes.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking scholarly analyses of media use—especially social and mobile—including how it is measured and how organizations leverage it. They want evidence on platform- and country-specific effects on trust, misinformation, political perceptions, life satisfaction, health/behavior, and economic outcomes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it examines, measures, or theorizes about media use—such as media consumption, news use, exposure, frequency/duration of use, or platform-specific behaviors—by individuals or organizations. Examples include studies tracking mobile or social media use (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Telegram), cross-national patterns of media consumption, or analyses linking media use to outcomes like trust, conspiracy beliefs, lifestyle politics, or life satisfaction, as well as methodological work proposing new measures of media use or audience overlap. Institutional cases (museums, newsrooms, sports organizations) are relevant when they analyze strategies, metrics, or patterns of social media use for distribution, engagement, or revenue. Non-relevant items are those focused mainly on industry policy, AI use in production, ethics, or media economics/commodification without analyzing usage behaviors, or pieces that discuss media trust/politics without measuring use. Edge cases include lists of accounts with minimal analysis, broad media environment descriptions without usage data, or papers where “use” refers to technology used by media rather than users’ or organizations’ media use—these are only marginally relevant at best.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks comprehensive surveys and datasets on media use—especially digital media and learning—in Germany, detailing devices, applications, contexts (education, work, leisure, purchasing), motivations and attitudes, and demographic breakdowns across time. It also looks for evaluations of digital learning practices, target groups, infrastructure, challenges, and assessment formats across schools, higher education, vocational, and continuing education.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly describes how people use media: which channels (TV, radio, social networks), how often and for what purposes (learning, political information, product research, leisure), on which devices, and with which user groups or demographics. Examples include surveys like AGMA Media Analyse on television/radio consumption, studies of digital learning that track use of WhatsApp, Moodle, YouTube or e-books, research on social media behavior and political information seeking, or scientists’ adoption of Web 2.0 tools. Documents are non-relevant if they only cover institutional equipment inventories, procurement or digitization strategies, or general attitudes without connecting them to actual media-use behavior; “media” in the sense of teaching aids or biological culture media is also out of scope. Edge cases: education-focused reports are relevant when they quantify or detail actual usage (e.g., frequency of LMS or webinars), but mere policy statements, methodology blurbs, or lists of available tools without user behavior are not. Historical or subgroup-specific media-use surveys (students, trainees, older adults, intensive social media users) remain relevant if they report patterns, frequencies, or contexts of use.</narr>

They also want perceptions of how the media cover poverty and social exclusion, with references to survey variables (qp16a/b/t, v532, V25, v467/Q94) that record those responses.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "media use" when it explicitly addresses how people consume media (television, radio, newspapers/printed press, internet websites, online social media), especially items about which medium is used most often (firstly/secondly), frequency of using media for political news, or survey variables and codebooks that record those responses (e.g., QP16A/QP16B, v532, qp16t summaries). Examples of relevant content include a survey questionnaire listing "Which media do you use most often? Firstly and then…", datasets or tables showing TV vs. social media usage, methodological notes on how media-use indices were computed, or analyses of how media cover poverty and social exclusion. Non-relevant documents include texts that mention “media” in unrelated contexts (e.g., biological growth media, advertising strategy without news-consumption focus), random metadata or filenames, or pages that only repeat variable codes without any mapping or descriptions — though code-only files become relevant if they include a codebook explaining the variables. Edge cases to watch for are short or ambiguous abbreviations (QP16A/B, DK) that require a legend to confirm relevance, near-duplicates or noisy repeated text that signal low-quality extraction, and multilingual variants that remain relevant if they clearly document media-use questions or findings.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks guidance and research on measuring and analyzing media use, particularly digital and social media behavior. They want methods, instruments, and expert insights (e.g., web tracking, mobile sensing, API data, validated scales) to study impacts such as misinformation, political communication, and fairness.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “media use” when it directly examines how people consume or engage with media (especially digital/social media), or presents methods and measures to capture such behavior. In this paragraph, items like the guide to web tracking for studying digital media use and online behavior, interviews about social media and democracy, misinformation, and visual content analysis, as well as discussions of linking surveys with social media traces and mobile sensing for tracking news or political information use are clearly relevant. Research validating media-related scales (e.g., media-based empathy with subscales like immersion in video games and correlations with media use) also counts as relevant because it measures media-related behavior or dispositions tied to use. By contrast, psychometric instruments on workaholism, attitudes toward asylum seekers, personality adjectives, teacher self-concepts, or technical notes on sampling error are non-relevant unless they explicitly analyze media consumption or usage patterns; API tutorials are only relevant if used to collect behavioral data on media use. Edge cases include fairness or NLP pipeline interviews: they are relevant when linked to how users produce/consume content on platforms, but become peripheral if focused solely on algorithmic properties without discussing user media behavior.</narr>

<title>work life balance</title>
<publication>
	<desc>Seek an evidence-based overview of work-life balance: its evolution, key determinants and inequalities, and how working hours, policies, and organizational programs affect outcomes across countries and groups. Identify effective employer strategies—especially in economic downturns—to improve employee well-being and promote gender equality.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly defines, measures, or analyzes work–life balance and the factors or policies that affect it (for example, flexible scheduling, childcare, parental leave, job sharing, shift work, or control over work hours) and links these to outcomes such as satisfaction, health, gender equality, or job performance. Studies examining WLB in specific contexts—like effects of an economic downturn on employer programs, differences across EU welfare regimes, women in academia or athletic training, expatriate workers in GCC countries, hotel housekeepers, or temporary employment in Australia—are relevant because they explicitly connect work arrangements to the ability to balance work and personal life. Empirical work reporting drivers of (dis)satisfaction with WLB, such as excessive hours, shift patterns, or inability to influence schedules, and macro models that trace the evolution of WLB discourse also count as relevant. Content is non-relevant if it mentions “work–life balance” only in passing, uses “balance” metaphorically without discussing the work/personal interface, or focuses solely on unrelated labor or economic metrics without linking to employees’ capacity to manage family, health, or personal domains. Edge cases include language or region-specific analyses (e.g., German or Italian policy studies) that remain relevant if they center on WLB, and claims about flexible or temporary work that are only relevant when they empirically assess their impact on WLB outcomes.</narr>

Include the role of unpaid care and the impact of policies such as family leave, institutional supports, and working time reduction.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly examines work–life balance, such as measuring satisfaction with balancing work and private life, conflicts between job demands and family responsibilities, working-time arrangements or flexibility, parental or family leave, and the impact of caregiving or public policies on this balance. Examples from the passage include EU surveys on COVID-19 and gender equality covering changes in paid work and unpaid care and use of institutional instruments to handle work–life balance challenges; studies of platform workers’ work patterns and work–life balance; university staff surveys on reconciling academic careers and parenthood; rural Germany interviews on quality of life and work–life balance; and GIP modules explicitly asking about satisfaction with work–life balance and working-time reductions. Documents that only touch adjacent constructs (e.g., job satisfaction, working hours, childcare, partner support) can be partly relevant if they connect those factors to the ability to reconcile work and family/private life, whereas purely methodological or psychometric scale tests without work–family content are weakly relevant. Non-relevant materials include datasets on Germany’s balance of payments, political attitudes of FDJ youth, historical population studies, agrarian reform economics, or a church magazine copy test—these may contain words like “balance” or “work” but do not address the work–family interface. Edge cases include records that list “work–life balance” without any measures or findings (not relevant), and items focusing on unpaid care or leave that materially affect the ability to combine work and private life (relevant even without the exact phrase).</narr>

	<desc>A concise summary of priorities and perceptions: identify which measures (e.g., reduced working hours, flexible hours, childcare facilities, parental/maternity/paternity leave, company measures, sharing household tasks, or none/other) people consider most important to improve the balance between family and work. Also assess whether women feel they have benefited or will benefit from EU/EC policies and programmes in their personal or professional lives, and explain why or why not.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “work life balance” when it directly addresses measures to help men and women balance family and professional life — for example discussing reduced working hours, childcare/care facilities, flexible working hours, parental/maternity/paternity leave, sharing household tasks, or company-level measures — or when it evaluates whether EU/EC policies have benefited women in this respect. Survey answers that explicitly state which measures should be a priority or give reasons why EC policies help (or do not help) are clearly relevant because they provide opinions and evidence about preferred solutions. Documents that are non-relevant include those that only contain repeated question text, isolated code labels (v244, v240, etc.) or metadata with no substantive responses, or texts that treat “work-life” only as a productivity or financial term without the family/household dimension. Edge cases include questionnaires that are relevant for capturing attitudes but not for causal analysis, and ambiguous mentions of “flexible working” that refer to unrelated concepts (e.g., flexible capital or hours in a different sector) — such cases require reading context to decide relevance. For example, a report showing respondents prioritize flexible hours and childcare is highly relevant, whereas a file listing variable codes with no answers is not.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks research-based insights and measurement tools on work–life balance, including how job attitudes, stress, and life events affect well-being and life satisfaction. They likely want validated survey scales and methods to assess these constructs.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to “work life balance” when it explicitly examines how people manage or reconcile work demands with personal, family, or leisure time, including topics like time-based or strain-based conflict, flexible work arrangements, boundary management, burnout, and effects on satisfaction, health, or performance. Research using surveys is relevant if it measures work–nonwork interface directly (e.g., items on work-to-family conflict, caregiving constraints, hours worked vs. off-time recovery) or analyzes determinants and outcomes of balance. The provided paragraph mostly covers survey methods and diverse psychosocial scales (life satisfaction, main status, supervisor relationship, occupational stress, alienation from work) and is only tangentially relevant unless it explicitly links these constructs to balancing work with nonwork roles. Edge cases include false positives where “balance” refers to sample balance in mixed-mode surveys or ethical “balancing” in digital behavioral data; terms like “working life” or general “quality of life” also aren’t sufficient without a work–family nexus. For example, a scale on satisfaction with pay or authoritarian attitudes is not relevant, whereas a measure of work–family time conflict or the impact of flexible scheduling on family time would be.</narr>

<title>medienkonsum</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking an overview of media consumption (Medienkonsum), especially among youths, including usage patterns (TV, internet, smartphones), determinants, and documented effects on aggression, socialization, school performance, health, stereotypes, and political attitudes. They may also want findings on differences by gender and migration background and the shift from television to online and social media.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively examines media consumption (Medienkonsum) behaviors, measurement, patterns, determinants, or consequences, rather than just naming the term. Examples include surveys of youths’ TV/internet/smartphone use, analyses linking quantitative or qualitative media consumption to aggression, school performance, socialization or integration, or studies using indices such as action/horror film viewing or device ownership as proxies for consumption. Theoretical or review articles that systematize media effects or socialization and explicitly discuss how consumption varies by gender, migration status, age, or context are also relevant. Non-relevant items are those that only mention media consumption in passing within a long list of topics, focus primarily on media production or political strategy with no analysis of audience use, or use “consumption” in a non-media sense without clarifying a media-specific component. Edge cases include synonyms like Mediennutzung/Mediengebrauch (which should count), mixed-topic reports that are relevant only if they contain a dedicated section with findings on media consumption, and background references (e.g., noting a shift from TV to online) that are insufficient unless supported by data or focused discussion.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is looking for information on media consumption: how people use TV, radio, newspapers, and online media, how this is measured in surveys (time spent, exposure, preferences), and how it relates to demographics, political attitudes, and behaviors.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it contains concrete measures or descriptions of media consumption behaviors, such as time spent with TV, radio, newspapers, internet or social media; frequency of use; program or genre preferences; primary information sources; trust in media; or household media equipment used as proxies for usage. Examples include time-use diaries that log quarter-hour media use, surveys of “Medienkonsum bei Tageszeitungen und Fernsehen,” datasets with “Zeitbudget für den Medienkonsum,” and panels like MEOF that passively track web/app usage. Studies that analyze how media consumption relates to political attitudes and voting, lifestyle and fashion segments, environmental concern, or COVID-19 information seeking are also relevant when they include explicit media-use variables. Edge cases include documents focusing mainly on media trust or interest without usage metrics (partially relevant), or on media devices and access where equipment variables serve as usage proxies. Non-relevant documents are those that only mention media consumption in passing without data, focus on content production or advertising markets rather than use, or discuss other kinds of consumption (e.g., diet) without specific media-use measures.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>The user wants an overview of "Medienkonsum" — how people use different media for entertainment and information, including types of media, usage patterns, effects, and practical guidance or recommendations for healthy media habits.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "medienkonsum" if it discusses how people consume media — types of media (TV, internet, social media, radio), usage patterns, time spent, demographic differences, or effects of media on users. The supplied paragraph — repeatedly mentioning "the various means of entertainment and information" — is semantically related and could be relevant even though it does not explicitly use the word "medienkonsum"; however, the repeated lines and HTML-like breaks suggest low quality or noisy duplication. Non-relevant documents simply name media channels without addressing consumption (for example a technical spec for broadcasting equipment, site navigation menus, or marketing copy), or focus on media production/policy rather than user behavior. Edge cases include translated text or synonyms (e.g., "media use" or "usage patterns") which should be treated as relevant, whereas boilerplate repetitions, spam, or isolated phrases with no substantive content should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user wants to understand how media consumption relates to empathy and how media-based empathy is measured—specifically information on the MBE scale (Happ & Pfetsch, 2015), its four subscales (medial concern, affective media empathy, cognitive media empathy, and video-game immersion), its psychometric properties across adolescents and adults, and the special role of immersion in games.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "medienkonsum" if it directly examines media consumption behaviors, digital media use patterns, or measurement instruments that capture empathy and reactions in media contexts—such as the MBE/MBE‑Skala (mediale Anteilnahme, affektive/kognitive Medienempathie, immersion in video games) and its psychometric validation in adolescent and adult samples. Empirical studies that report sample sizes, factor structure, reliability, and links between media use and outcomes (e.g., aggression, cyberbullying, immersion effects) are highly pertinent because they address how media consumption shapes emotional responses. Documents that are not relevant include those focused solely on face‑to‑face empathy without any media context, on unrelated consumption types (e.g., food consumption), or on media production/marketing strategies that do not analyze users’ consumption or empathic responses. Edge cases include papers that mention "medienkonsum" only tangentially, studies of media multitasking or gameplay mechanics that do not assess empathic processes (borderline relevant), and translations or policy briefs in German that lack empirical measurement but summarize consumption trends (potentially relevant depending on depth).</narr>

They want empirical and theoretical studies (largely from German/European contexts) including social-psychological models, survey findings, methodological issues, and policy implications.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly examines Umweltbewusstsein (environmental awareness)—for example by defining its cognitive components, modeling its link to Umweltverhalten (pro-environmental behavior), or analyzing survey data and policy implications. Strong signals include discussions of determinants (age, education, norms, responsibility attribution), domain applications (energy use, transport choices, waste/recycling), and methodological issues like social desirability bias, specificity mismatches, time horizon, or seasonality in behavior measures. Materials that only mention Umweltbewusstsein in passing—such as broad youth or policy reports where it is one of many topics, or a brief note that public awareness is “growing”—are only weakly relevant. Non-relevant items discuss “awareness” in non-environmental contexts, “environment” in technical/computing senses, or list the term as a keyword without substantive treatment. Edge cases include spelling variants (Umweltbewußtsein vs. Umweltbewusstsein), English equivalents (environmental consciousness/attitudes), and studies focused on incentives or organizational strategies that treat awareness as necessary but not sufficient; these are relevant when they explicitly link back to the concept and its behavioral implications.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks research and data on environmental awareness, focusing on how public attitudes and behaviors are measured and have evolved over time. Specifically, they want details and findings from Germany’s biennial “Umweltbewusstsein in Deutschland” surveys (1996–2024), including methodology, samples, thematic modules (e.g., mobility, energy, health, agriculture), and trend results.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly examines environmental awareness (Umweltbewusstsein), for example reporting on the “Umweltbewusstsein in Deutschland” survey series, its methods (e.g., CAWI panels, sampling), time trends, and constructs such as affect, cognition, and behavior. Content that analyzes attitudes, behaviors, policy perceptions, and segmentation related to environmental awareness, or related modules like environmental labels, Energiewende acceptance, or biodiversity awareness tied to consumers’ awareness, is strongly relevant. By contrast, pieces where “Umweltbewusstsein” appears only as a minor attribute in otherwise unrelated topics (e.g., corporate image studies of computer firms that include one item about a company’s environmental consciousness) are weakly relevant or non-relevant. Discussions of environment or technology without assessing awareness levels, or generic consumer studies without an explicit awareness construct, are not relevant. Edge cases include older spellings (Umweltbewußtsein), corporate vs. population awareness, and methodological details that are relevant only insofar as they illuminate how Umweltbewusstsein is measured or changes over time.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants a clear definition and overview of "umweltbewusstsein" (environmental awareness), including its significance for individuals and society. They may also be seeking examples, ways to foster eco-conscious behavior, and methods to measure or promote it.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "umweltbewusstsein" if it explicitly discusses environmental awareness — for example definitions, surveys or statistics on public attitudes, educational programs, behavioral studies (recycling, low-carbon transport), awareness-raising campaigns, or policy measures intended to increase ecological consciousness, especially in German-language or Germany-focused contexts. Highly relevant documents include NGO reports on German citizens’ environmental attitudes, academic papers measuring "Umweltbewusstsein," school curricula on sustainability, and case studies of successful awareness campaigns. Documents are non-relevant if they merely mention the word in passing, use it as marketing jargon without evidence (e.g., a product labeled "umweltbewusst" with no substantiation), or if the text is about unrelated topics that happen to contain the word (company names, trademarks, or literal biological uses of "Umwelt" in ethology that do not address human environmental attitudes). Edge cases include English-language materials using the synonym "environmental awareness" (relevant if the user intends the same concept), articles reporting environmental outcomes (like emissions or recycling rates) that imply awareness without naming it (potentially relevant), and philosophical or scientific uses of "Umwelt" that require checking intent before deeming them relevant.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks an overview of “environmental awareness” as measured by the SEU scale, including its rational-choice basis, core subscales (intrinsic and instrumental views of nature, nature as life support), and the related attitudes, behavioral intentions, behaviors, and content areas (e.g., transport use, energy/water saving) it assesses.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses Umweltbewusstsein (environmental consciousness) as a belief or worldview, especially when defining or operationalizing it with scales like the SEU/SEU3, referencing subscales such as intrinsic and instrumental nature understanding or “nature as a basis for existence,” and grounding it in frameworks like Rational Choice or the Maloney & Ward Ecology Scale. It is also relevant if it measures related constructs—environmental attitudes, behavioral intentions, or self-reported behaviors—and covers content domains like transport choices, energy or water saving without confounding them with the theoretical constructs. Examples of highly relevant content include descriptions of scale construction, validity, subscale items, or applications of the SEU in surveys. Non-relevant documents would merely mention environmental protection practices or campaigns without discussing environmental consciousness as a construct, or focus on environmental knowledge/policy/CSR without linking to beliefs or measurement. Edge cases include texts using “umweltbewusst” as a casual adjective (likely weak relevance), discussions of “ecological attitude” that map clearly to the SEU domains (potentially relevant), or papers in other languages that operationalize the same constructs under different labels (e.g., “environmental worldview”).</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks research-based information on media usage patterns—especially digital, social, and mobile—how they vary by platform and demographic group, and how they influence attitudes and everyday behaviors. The focus is on German-speaking contexts, including platform-specific effects (e.g., Telegram during COVID-19), youth and family settings, and longitudinal/comparative findings.</desc>
	<narr>For the query “medien nutzung” (media use), documents are relevant when they analyze or describe how people use media—e.g., frequencies, platforms, contexts, demographics, or behavioral correlates. Clear matches include empirical studies linking COVID-19 conspiracy belief to platform use (Telegram, Facebook, YouTube), surveys of social media and messaging adoption (ARD/ZDF Onlinestudie, WhatsApp/Instagram trends), research on mobile media in public spaces or boredom prevention, and work on youth, family, or historical populations (DDR youth, Austrian households) that report concrete usage patterns. Also relevant are platform-specific or longitudinal comparisons, and pieces that operationalize media use (e.g., usage categories, time use, device ownership) even if embedded in broader questions. Less relevant are papers focused primarily on design or gender in digital artifacts, theoretical models of sociocultural change without usage data, or general discussions where media is background and usage is not measured or described. Edge cases include conceptual “Medienkompetenz” articles that treat media use as one sub-dimension, protest communication studies that touch on social media use, or methodological notes on sensors that mention capturing “Mediennutzung” but do not analyze it—these may be partially relevant depending on depth of usage detail.</narr>

<research_data>
	<desc>Find empirical studies and datasets on media usage in Germany, including how people use different media for product information and purchase decisions, social media behaviors and discourse, and the adoption and evaluation of digital media/OER in schools, vocational training, higher education, and adult learning. Emphasis on demographic breakdowns, attitudes, reliability assessments, and challenges of digital learning.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “medien nutzung” when it reports how people use media—devices, platforms, and channels—covering purposes (e.g., learning, shopping, politics), intensity or frequency, contexts (school, university, workplace, home), and demographics. Examples from the paragraph that clearly match include the Monitor Digitale Bildung surveys detailing smartphone/tablet use, LMS like Moodle/ILIAS, OER adoption, digital exams, and attitudes across schools, training, higher education, and continuing education; the Kantar Public study of intensive social media users (language, discussion culture, hate speech); AGMA’s Media-Analyse on TV/radio consumption (1992–1997); and modules on using media to inform purchase decisions and assessing reliability across media. By contrast, pieces that only describe policies, technical specifications, or purely methodological notes without describing actual user behavior, usage metrics, or adoption patterns would be non-relevant. Edge cases: studies about “Medien” as teaching materials or OER are relevant only if they include concrete usage or adoption (e.g., whether teachers or learners actually use apps, videos, or LMS); items where “Medien” refers to laboratory culture media, artistic mixed media, or legal/media-industry structures without user usage data are not relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants to capture how people use and perceive media — frequency and channels for political information, trust and fairness in coverage of public figures and scandals, use of social media as a news source, engagement with authorities/media, and related attitudes (e.g., copyright, local issues like land use). This information need likely supports analyzing survey responses or designing a questionnaire about media consumption and opinions.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "medien nutzung" if it explicitly addresses how people use media (types and frequency), for example survey items asking "Wie oft nutzen Sie die Medien (Fernsehen, Zeitungen, Radio, Internet) um sich politisch zu informieren" or "An wie vielen Tagen in der Woche nutzen Sie soziale Medien, Blogs und Foren ...". Text that lists channels (TV, newspapers, radio, internet, social media), measures of use (days per week, frequency), or questions about using media for political information or education is a strong match. Documents that focus on unrelated topics — e.g., brown‑coal mining, land‑use decisions, or legal cases about individuals — are not relevant unless they also report on audience consumption patterns or public reactions. Edge cases include pieces about media coverage of specific figures (Wulff, Friedman) or about copyright on platforms: these are relevant only when they include survey questions, usage statistics, or discussion of how audiences access and use media; mere event reporting or legal argumentation without user‑behavior content is non‑relevant.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it examines the use of media or communication technologies by people, such as access, frequency, and networks for landline, mobile phone, and internet-based services, or behaviors on social media. Pretests or questionnaires that measure Mediennutzung/Kommunikationsmedien usage (e.g., modules on social media in election studies, ICT/IoT use in households or at work) are relevant, even if they focus on measurement design. By contrast, items about unrelated “usage” such as solararium use, smoking-cessation aids, or general methodological pieces on web paradata or survey-trust interventions are non-relevant unless they directly analyze media-use behavior. Edge cases include instruments with a “media” subscale in teacher self-concepts—these are only relevant if they report actual media-use practices rather than attitudes—and ICT/digital skills surveys that qualify only when they explicitly address media/communication use.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking scholarly research on political attitudes, particularly in Germany, examining East–West differences, youth and migrant groups, and changes since reunification. They want determinants (e.g., authoritarianism, education, unemployment), links to democracy and participation, and evidence from surveys such as ALLBUS, ISSP, and IEA.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it analyzes, measures, or compares political attitudes (Einstellungen) of individuals or groups, such as studies of youth or regional differences, trends over time, or attitudes toward democracy, parties, institutions, minorities, or gender equality. Examples include survey-based analyses (e.g., ALLBUS, IEA) of East–West differences in democracy satisfaction, trust in institutions, left–right self-placement, right-wing extremism, or political interest and participation, as well as work on the political culture or attitudes of elites. Research into determinants and correlates of political attitudes—authoritarianism, ethnocentrism, education, unemployment, migration generation—based on empirical data is also relevant. Non-relevant items are those using “Einstellung” in other senses (hiring, settings), pieces about political institutions or policies without addressing people’s attitudes, or purely methodological/media-industry discussions unless they specifically examine journalists’ own political attitudes. Edge cases include broad works where attitudes are only one section (partially relevant), historical or DDR-era studies that assess ideological attitudes (relevant), and prescriptive or propagandistic texts lacking empirical assessment of attitudes (borderline to non-relevant).</narr>

<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking studies and survey data on political attitudes—such as left-right orientation, party preference, participation, and views on democracy, protests, and extremism—across various populations, especially German students and youth. They likely want instruments and findings covering related issues (e.g., international relations, media use) with demographic correlates.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly measures or analyzes people’s political attitudes or orientations, such as left–right self-placement, party identification or preference, sympathy scales for parties (e.g., CDU, SPD, FDP, NPD, DKP), evaluations of politicians, issue positions (e.g., NATO, Notstandsgesetze, Vietnam, DDR recognition), or views on democracy, protest, and use of political violence. Surveys of students, youth, teachers, or the general population that cover political participation, voting behavior, political efficacy, issue competence, and attitudes toward campus or national politics (e.g., SDS/APO, student parliaments, Hochschulreform) are strongly relevant. Mixed-topic datasets are relevant when they include political-attitude scales or items, even if they also cover media use, lifestyle, or consumption. Non-relevant would be documents where “Einstellung” means settings, adjustment, or hiring, or materials limited to administrative, economic, or cultural topics without attitudinal measures toward politics. Edge cases include datasets mentioning political attitude only as a single background variable—these are weakly relevant unless they report distributions or analyze it—and domain-specific attitudes (e.g., higher-education politics) which are relevant if they still capture broader political orientation or partisan sympathies.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants a concise survey question to measure political ideology by asking respondents to place their own views on a left–right scale. They also intend related items about respondents' attitudes toward people from different religious groups.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "politische einstellung" when it explicitly addresses political orientation or a left–right self-placement question — for example survey items that ask "Wo würden Sie Ihre eigenen politischen Ansichten einstufen?" or instrument metadata/variable labels like pa01, po01, or v54 that map to a left–right scale. Relevant documents include questionnaire text, coding instructions, response scales (e.g. "Wir haben hier einen Maßstab der von links nach rechts verläuft"), or dataset fields that record respondents' political self-placement. Non-relevant materials mention politics only tangentially (news reports about parties or policies, biographical notes about politicians) or use "Einstellung" in a non-political sense (e.g. technical settings, product preferences) — these do not match the intent of measuring individual political attitude. Edge cases include documents using synonyms or other languages ("political orientation", "left-right scale", "self-placement") which are relevant, and texts about attitudes toward social groups (e.g. "Einstellung zu Menschen aus folgenden Religionsgruppen") which may be related but are only partially relevant unless explicitly tied to political ideology; likewise, repeated boilerplate or duplicated question strings indicate a questionnaire instrument (highly relevant) but add little extra value without unique wording or metadata.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking information on survey instruments and validated scales for measuring political attitudes and related socio-political constructs, especially within German and European studies. They want details on topics such as left–right orientation, immigration/asylum, welfare redistribution, climate change, antisemitism, gender equality, political efficacy/cynicism, and the associated pretests and methodologies (e.g., cognitive interviews, web probing) used in studies like CSES, ESS, and ALLBUS.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly measures, analyzes, or reports on political attitudes (politische Einstellung), such as left–right self-placement, views on immigration/asylum, redistribution and income inequality, political cynicism or efficacy, nationalism, or respect for state authority. Highly relevant examples include descriptions of CSES Module 5 or ESS immigration items, the SECS-GER conservatism scale, the KPZ (political cynicism) or PEKS (political efficacy) short scales, and pretests covering attitudes toward elites, national identity, welfare state, climate policy, antisemitism, and gender equality. Method-focused texts (e.g., cognitive interviewing, web probing) are relevant only if they detail the actual attitude items or constructs; purely procedural accounts are weakly relevant. Content on adjacent domains (e.g., ego-centered networks in a COVID study) is non-relevant unless it explicitly links to political trust, compliance, or value orientations; similarly, attitudes toward parental authority are borderline unless tied to political or state authority/patriotism. Irrelevant cases also include uses of “Einstellung” meaning technical settings or hiring, or general political news without identifiable attitudinal constructs or measures.</narr>

<title>ungleichheit</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks a comprehensive overview of social inequality—its definitions, dimensions, and perceived (in)justice—and how its forms and levels have changed over time, especially in Germany and Europe. They want evidence on causes and consequences across income, education, health, environment, and labor markets (including ethnic and regional differences), along with relevant sociological theories and survey findings.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “ungleichheit” when it explicitly analyzes inequality—especially social inequality—such as income gaps, class and stratification, educational disparities by gender or region, ethnic disadvantage, or health inequalities, and may reference empirical sources or theories (e.g., ALLBUS surveys, Marx/Weber, environmental justice, climate and inequality links). Discussions that define the term, trace changes over time (East/West Germany, Austria), or examine causes, consequences, and public perceptions of inequality are also highly relevant. Theoretical or methodological pieces that debate how to conceptualize or measure Ungleichheit (e.g., opportunity vs. outcome, new dimensions of inequality) count if inequality is the central analytic focus. A document is non-relevant if “Ungleichheit” appears only in passing, is used in a different sense (mathematical inequalities, product “unevenness,” “Ungleichgewicht”), or focuses solely on “Gleichheit” without analyzing disparities. Edge cases include texts using synonyms or compounds (Einkommensungleichheit, gesundheitliche Ungleichheit), or linking inequality to climate and environment; these are relevant if they ultimately examine unequal distributions of resources, power, prestige, education, or health.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>Find comprehensive datasets and studies on social inequality (Ungleichheit), including trends, determinants, attitudes, and outcomes across employment, education, income, health, and politics. Emphasis is on German and comparative international sources (e.g., ALLBUS, ISSP, GISD) and research on factors such as mobility, atypical employment, and the effects of direct democracy on inequality.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant when it treats “Ungleichheit” as a primary topic and provides measures, analyses, or theory related to inequality, for example ALLBUS or ISSP modules on Soziale Ungleichheit, the German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation, TwinLife’s study of social inequalities, or research on how direct democracy affects socio-economic, political, or legal inequalities. Relevance is strengthened by concrete indicators and variables tied to inequality, such as income distribution, deprivation scores, social mobility, acceptance of inequality, mechanisms producing inequality, or migrant–native disparities in education. Documents are non-relevant if they only mention inequality in passing while focusing on other themes (e.g., environment, national identity, or survey methods), or if “inequality” appears in an unrelated sense (like mathematical inequalities). Mixed-scope survey overviews are borderline: they count as relevant only when an inequality-focused module or items are explicitly included, while duplicate or generic versions without such content should be down-weighted. Geographic scope can be broad—Germany, Poland, or cross-national datasets are all relevant—provided the work includes measures or outcomes of unequal conditions or attitudes; otherwise, it should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants to find and understand how "Ungleichheit" (social inequality) is represented in a German survey asking respondents for the three biggest problems in Germany — specifically where "Soziale Ungleichheit / Gefälle" appears among the coded response categories (F.59, V271/SPSS) and how to locate, interpret, and analyse its occurrence in the data.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "ungleichheit" when it explicitly discusses social or economic inequality (for example the entry "Soziale Ungleichheit Gefälle" or related items like "Neue Armut", "Löhne zu niedrig", "Renten" or "Ungleiche Lebensverhältnisse Ost West") or uses clear synonyms and examples of unequal outcomes. The paragraph you provided contains several direct markers of relevance (code 007 for social inequality, code 063 for unequal living conditions East–West, plus many items—housing, wages, poverty—that are typical drivers or measures of inequality). It is non‑relevant if the document only lists unrelated problems (e.g. "Rechtschreibreform", "Atomkraft", "Benzinpreis") or if "ungleichheit" only appears as an incidental label in a code list without substantive discussion. Edge cases include texts that imply inequality through topics like rents, unemployment, or pension stress—these should be treated as relevant if they analyze disparities, but excluded if they merely enumerate items without linking them to unequal distribution; also beware false positives from mathematical uses of "Ungleichung" or from translations that change meaning.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking research-based information on social inequality—how it is measured and perceived—and its relationship to populist attitudes, especially using German/European surveys and instruments (e.g., ALLBUS, ISSP, EGP class schema) and infographics on income and wealth distribution. They likely want methodological details on scales, pretests, and comparative measurements.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “ungleichheit” when it focuses on social or economic inequality—such as income/wealth distribution, perceived inequality, stratification/class schemas (e.g., EGP), and related measurement instruments or surveys (ALLBUS, ISSP), including methodological work that evaluates how inequality is assessed. The provided paragraph is highly relevant: it centers on perceived social inequalities, links them to populist attitudes, discusses factual information about income and wealth distribution, and details scales (Egalitarianism) and class schemas (EGP) used in comparative research. Documents are non-relevant if they use “Ungleichheit” outside the social-science context (e.g., mathematical inequalities, technical tolerances) or only mention the term without substantive discussion or data. Edge cases include methodology-only pieces (e.g., cognitive pretests) that remain relevant when they test inequality items or graphics, and topics like immigration/antisemitism that are relevant only if explicitly tied to attitudes toward social inequality. Related terms such as Einkommensverteilung, Vermögensungleichheit, soziale Mobilität, Klassen-/Schichtmodelle, and Egalitarismus strengthen relevance, especially when backed by empirical analysis or experiments.</narr>

<title>umweltschutz</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks a comprehensive overview of environmental protection that links policy, economics, and society, comparing integrated versus end-of-pipe strategies and assessing economic/labor impacts. Focus is on Germany/Europe with global context, including the roles of government, NGOs, and institutions like the WTO, public attitudes and psychology, and debates such as environmental justice.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “umweltschutz” when it substantively addresses environmental protection—such as policies, legal frameworks, technologies (e.g., production-integrated approaches versus end-of-pipe), governance, or the economic significance of the environmental sector. Analyses of energy policy trade-offs (security, cost, environment), the role of international bodies like the WTO in fisheries subsidies or green goods liberalization, or discussions of carbon markets and Green New Deal strategies are clearly relevant, as are overviews of environmental management and consulting. Critiques and sociological studies of environmental NGOs and movements, environmental justice debates about the distribution of environmental burdens and benefits, or environmental psychology guidance for fostering pro-environmental behavior also qualify if they illuminate how environmental protection is organized, implemented, or motivated. Edge cases include mixed-focus items (e.g., “Arbeits- und Umweltschutz” in universities) which are relevant only if they provide meaningful content on environmental protection rather than mainly occupational safety, and “Naturschutz” pieces that are framed as part of broader Umweltschutz. Non-relevant are texts that merely name the term without analysis, purely promotional membership or fundraising content lacking environmental substance, or uses of “Schutz” in unrelated domains (e.g., data or personal protection).</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks comprehensive statistics and surveys on environmental protection, including revenues from environmental goods and services by industry and environmental area, employment, and domestic vs. foreign sales in Germany over time. They also want research on public attitudes, behaviors, and policy evaluations related to environmental protection, transport, and consumer issues in Germany and the EU.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses environmental protection—such as reporting statistics on environmental goods and services, sectoral revenues by environmental domain (e.g., waste, water, air pollution control, climate protection), employment in the green sector, or exports vs. domestic sales of green technologies (e.g., solar, wind, insulation) from 1997–2020. It is also relevant if it analyzes environmental attitudes and behavior (recycling, energy saving, transport mode choice, willingness to pay, eco-tax), evaluates environmental quality (noise, air, water) or policy effectiveness, or discusses EU/German environmental policy and governance. By contrast, content primarily about consumer protection, TV program evaluations, general civil law, EU integration, or union politics is non-relevant unless it specifically examines environmental protection within those topics. Edge cases include multi-topic surveys where Umweltschutz is one module—these are relevant if that module is substantial or retrievable; closely related terms like Klimaschutz, Naturschutz, Luftreinhaltung, and environmental goods markets also qualify, while mere incidental keyword mentions without data, policy, or behavioral analysis do not.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for information about public attitudes and responsibility for environmental protection (Umweltschutz)—specifically who (EU, state governments, or political parties such as SPD, CDU, Greens) is seen as most capable of ensuring effective environmental protection, assessments of state governments’ performance, and whether the situation has changed since last autumn. They likely want survey-style questions or results comparing parties and regional governments (e.g., Saarland, Niedersachsen, Nordrhein-Westfalen) on effective environmental protection.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "umweltschutz" when the keyword is the central subject and the text discusses concrete aspects like policies, solutions, responsible actors, or measures — for example, passages asking which party can provide "wirksamen Umweltschutz" or referring to "Loesung Umweltschutz" and "W. VERBESSERT UMWELTSCH." are highly relevant. Relevance is also determined by scope: items that treat EU-level obligations ("EU Aufgabe Umweltschutz"), state/regional implementation (Saarland, Niedersachsen, Nordrhein‑Westfalen), or concrete improvements score higher than passing mentions. A document is non‑relevant if the term appears only incidentally, as noise or metadata (e.g., repeated codes like v53, V267), or in unrelated contexts (homonyms, OCR artifacts), or if it is mostly duplicated questionnaire prompts with no substantive content. Edge cases include political‑focus texts that mention parties often but contain few policy details (politically relevant but substantively weak), translations or dated notes (e.g., "since last autumn") that affect timeliness, and documents in other languages or heavily redacted items that may require additional processing to confirm relevance.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking information on a standardized tool to measure environmental awareness and protection-related behaviors, specifically the SEU scale based on Maloney and Ward’s Ecology Scale, including what constructs it assesses (attitudes, behavioral intentions, self-reported behaviors) and the domains it covers (e.g., transport use, energy/water saving).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it addresses environmental protection (Umweltschutz) directly or describes tools for assessing it, such as scales that measure environmental consciousness and related behaviors. References to the SEU/SEU3 or the Maloney and Ward Ecology Scale, and coverage of constructs like environmental attitudes, behavioral intentions, and self-reported behaviors—especially across domains like transport use, energy saving, or water conservation—strongly indicate relevance. Content that merely discusses psychological scales unrelated to the environment, uses “Schutz” in a different sense (e.g., data protection), or treats “environment” abstractly without linking to protective actions or measurable behaviors would be non-relevant. Edge cases include methodological papers about self-report bias or construct confounding; these are relevant if they pertain to measuring environmental behaviors or attitudes tied to Umweltschutz. Likewise, domain-specific discussions (e.g., energy-saving practices) remain relevant when framed as contributions to environmental protection rather than purely technical efficiency.</narr>

<title>violence</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking scholarly resources that theorize and define violence from a sociological perspective—beyond causes to processes, typologies, and “violence regimes.” They also want empirical measures and findings on gender-based/domestic, symbolic, digital, political, and school violence, including intersectional analyses, welfare-state comparisons, media representations, and EU prevalence data.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “violence” if it directly examines violence as a phenomenon—its definitions, processes, causes, consequences, prevalence, or typologies—and may use related terms like domestic/intimate partner violence, gender-based violence, school or political violence, digital violence, or structural/symbolic violence. Empirical studies that measure or describe violence through surveys, indices, case studies, video data analysis, or interviews (for example, an EU survey of gender-based violence, a Violence Regimes Index, or analyses of status-violence norms in schools and TV news depictions) are strongly relevant, as are works on dynamics such as escalation, temporal sequences, emotions, the body, and institutionalization. Conceptual debates about what counts as violence (narrow physical versus broader structural/cultural; symbolic or epistemic violence) are relevant when grounded in sociological frameworks or linked to policy, prevention, or intervention. Documents are less relevant if they only mention “violence” in passing, use it purely as a rhetorical flourish, or discuss adjacent topics (e.g., welfare regimes, ICTs, democratization) without tying them to violent practices or outcomes, or if they list incidents without analysis. Edge cases include pieces centered on harassment or psychological abuse that avoid the word “violence” yet frame the harms as violent (relevant), whereas work on “non-violence” or purely metaphorical “epistemic violence” may be off-target unless explicitly connected to concrete violent practices or regimes.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks comprehensive survey-based information on violence—its prevalence, forms, perpetrators, attitudes, consequences, reporting, and protective behaviors—across varied contexts (schools, domestic, political/public) and populations, with emphasis on Germany and the EU. The aim is to understand patterns and correlates (e.g., social change, demographics) to inform prevention and policy-making.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively examines violence—its prevalence, forms (e.g., physical, sexual, stalking), contexts (school, domestic, political demonstrations, neighborhood), perpetrators and victims, consequences (health and well‑being), reporting behaviors, or prevention/protective measures and policies. Clear examples include surveys on violence against women and girls, schoolchildren’s use and experience of violence and property damage, readiness to use violence in political protest, group-focused enmity and neighborhood conflict, or conflict-related violence and self-protection strategies. Studies that measure attitudes, norms, and legal knowledge around violence (e.g., acceptance of corporal punishment, effectiveness of police or social services, reasons for violence, trends over time) are also relevant. Non-relevant items are those where “violence” is only mentioned in passing within broader topics (EU institutions, pensions/aging, fishery consumer habits) without dedicated data, analysis, or measures about violence, or where the term is used metaphorically. Edge cases include multi-topic datasets: they are relevant if they contain a dedicated module with detailed questions on violence or fear/threats of violence, and content on attitudes toward foreigners is relevant only when it explicitly addresses violent acts or reactions.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A concise summary of survey items and variables about violence, specifically public perceptions of who is likely to inflict violence on children (parents, relatives, siblings, other children, teachers/childminders, strangers), whether violence is geographically concentrated or national, acceptance of domestic violence against women and men, and the extent of post‑election violence. The information need is to identify and analyze attitudes and reported patterns of violence (perpetrators, geographic spread, and social acceptance) for research or monitoring.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "violence" when it explicitly discusses violent acts, perpetrators, victims, or contexts—for example entries like "VIOL AG CHILDR BY STRANGER," "DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN," or "POST ELECTION VIOLENCE" clearly match. It is especially useful if the text describes types of violence (child abuse, domestic, post‑election), who perpetrates it (partner, teacher, sibling, stranger), where it occurs (geographic concentration), or attitudes toward violence (acceptance questions). A document is less relevant if it only mentions "violence" peripherally, uses the term metaphorically (e.g., "violent storm"), or contains only opaque codes/labels without explanatory content. Edge cases include structured survey metadata that lists variables like v322–v329: these are likely relevant because they index violence topics, but they may be low value if you need incident narratives or prevalence data rather than variable names; duplicated lines or repeated question stems add little new information. Finally, check the user’s intent—seeking incident reports, survey measures, or attitudinal items will change which documents are most relevant.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks information on questionnaires and psychometric scales related to youth violence and associated attitudes—covering violent behaviors, pro-violence norms, Machiavellianism, authoritarianism, and law-and-order positions—as well as a teacher self-efficacy scale for handling bullying, especially those developed in Bielefeld University’s Youth and Violence projects.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “violence” when it directly discusses violent behavior, attitudes that endorse or normalize physical violence, or tools that measure violence (e.g., scales for violence against persons or objects, or teacher self-efficacy for handling bullying/mobbing). Content describing research projects centered on youth and violence, the development and validation of violence-related questionnaires, or classifications of violent settings is also clearly relevant. Material that only mentions adjacent constructs (e.g., Machiavellianism, authoritarianism, or law-and-order orientations) is relevant only if it explicitly links those traits to the occurrence, endorsement, or management of violence; otherwise, such sections may be marginal. Edge cases include discussions of “mobbing” or school bullying, which typically count as forms of interpersonal violence and are therefore pertinent, and psychometric details (item ranges, reliability) that are relevant insofar as they pertain to violence-measurement tools. Non-relevant content would be metaphorical uses of “violence” (e.g., “violent storms”) or brief, unrelated mentions without substantive treatment of violent behavior or its assessment.</narr>

<title>kriminalität</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks a comprehensive overview of crime as a social phenomenon, including how it is measured (objective vs. subjective), explained, and trends across societies. They also want insights into media discourse and public perception, demographic patterns (e.g., migrants, gender, youth), and implications for prevention and criminal justice policy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively discusses crime (Kriminalität) as a social, legal, cultural, or statistical phenomenon—such as crime rates and trends, victimization, policing and sanctions, public fear versus perceived safety, or criminological theory. Strong examples include analyses contrasting police statistics with subjective insecurity, media studies of crime reporting, research on youth or migrant crime, gender differences in offending, or historical/cross-national time series of offenses and punishment. Work on prevention policy, labeling theory, or the social construction of crime discourse also qualifies; even cultural pieces (e.g., on Gangsta Rap or everyday moral storytelling) are relevant when they examine representations of crime and their social effects. Non-relevant are texts where the term appears only in passing, is used metaphorically, or materials about crime fiction entertainment unless they critically analyze crime as a social issue. Edge cases include papers focused on public security or inequality without repeatedly saying “Kriminalität” but clearly centered on criminal behavior (relevant), and methodological studies that test survey reliability about crime (relevant if crime is the primary application, not if it’s incidental).</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks comprehensive information on crime, including official statistics and time-series trends, offense and offender data, regional patterns, and criminal justice outcomes. They also want survey-based insights on fear of crime, victimization, and institutional trust, focused on Germany (including former East Germany) and related EU topics like cybercrime.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it provides empirical information about crime, such as statistics on offenses, offenders, convictions, or police/judicial processing (e.g., DDR time series of Straftaten and Täter per 100,000, regional crime rates by Bezirk, or Kaiserreich conviction rates by offense). Surveys that measure fear of crime, victimization, safety perceptions, trust in institutions, or attitudes toward crime and punishment (e.g., Saxony 2022 security study, student victimization/fear surveys, gastronomy owners’ experiences with extortion, or Eurobarometer modules on cybercrime) are also relevant. Content discussing crime types and structures (Deliktstruktur, Gewalt, Diebstahl, Raub, Cybercrime), “innere Sicherheit,” media consumption about crime, or policy measures to combat crime qualifies as relevant. By contrast, broad political or living-conditions surveys where “Kriminalität” appears only as a single item in a long list of issues, or modules unrelated to crime (e.g., agriculture or rail privatization) are non-relevant unless they include a substantive crime section. Edge cases include mixed datasets with both crime and non-crime modules (partially relevant) and documents using synonyms like Straftaten/Delikte without the exact keyword (still relevant).</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>User is looking for information about public perceptions of crime — specifically whether people feel threatened by crime, whether they expect more crime because of refugees, and whether crime-fighting efforts are sufficient. They likely need survey question wording or aggregated attitudinal data on these topics.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "kriminalität" when it explicitly discusses crime — for example survey questions like "Fühlen Sie sich durch Kriminalität bedroht?", items about crime prevention ("Kriminalitätsbekämpfung genug") or expectations that refugees will increase crime. High relevance comes from the word appearing in the main question text, repeated survey items or variable labels (V###) that capture perceptions or policy attitudes about crime. Documents that only mention "Kriminalität" in passing, bury it in unrelated metadata (e.g., week numbers, "Zu einem anderen Thema"), or use it as a tag without substantive content are not relevant. Edge cases include pieces that discuss crime in a different sense (historical, legal definitions) or use synonyms like "Verbrechen"/"Straftat" — these can be relevant depending on whether the user seeks perception-focused survey items or broader crime discussion. Also note sensitive subtopics (e.g., linking "Flüchtlinge" to crime) are relevant to the keyword but may require careful handling for bias and context.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>A user wants an overview of crime-related research and survey instruments used in European projects, including topics like fear of crime and local safety perceptions, internet-facilitated pharmaceutical crime, illicit trade in cultural goods, and a youth self-report delinquency scale. They also need details on the specific survey questions and the cognitive pretesting methods applied (online/web probing, face‑to‑face and telephone cognitive interviews).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "kriminalität" if it explicitly treats crime or criminality—its types, prevalence, victims or offenders, prevention and enforcement policies, or research about the “dark figure” of unreported crime. For example, texts like the AUDITS pretest (fear of crime, citizens’ safety perceptions), the ALPhA study (internet-facilitated drug crime and fraudulent medicine suppliers), the ILLICID project (illicit trade in antiquities and dark‑field measurement), or a youth self‑report delinquency scale are clearly relevant because they investigate criminal behavior, markets, or prevention. Documents that are non‑relevant either lack any crime content or only mention crime incidentally (e.g., a methodological paper on web‑probing without applying it to criminal topics, or administrative reports about unrelated municipal services). Edge cases include texts on “security” or “safety” that are relevant only when they address criminal threats (traffic safety as crime prevention vs. non‑criminal accident prevention), or pieces where the term appears as a substring or in translation errors; in such cases relevance depends on whether criminal intent, illegal markets, victimization, or law enforcement are substantively discussed. Good signals of relevance are explicit crime-related keywords, empirical measures of offenses or fear of crime, descriptions of illicit markets or offenders/victims, and discussion of prevention or policy responses.</narr>

<title>verkehrsmittel</title>
<publication>
	<desc>Information on transport modes (Verkehrsmittel), especially public transport and multimodal options, focusing on factors that influence mode choice and how policies and technologies shape usage. Seeks research and data on commuting and travel behavior, accessibility, environmental impacts, and interventions that promote shifts to more sustainable modes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “verkehrsmittel” when it substantively discusses modes of transport (e.g., train, bus, car, bicycle) or the choice and use of these modes, such as studies on commuting by rail, multimodal travel habits, or factors influencing mode choice (like the planned behavior study comparing car, bike, and bus). Empirical work, policy analyses, or evaluations that focus on public transport access, tickets (e.g., a Semesterticket), mobility management, or urban transport integration also count as relevant, even if they don’t repeat the keyword but use domain terms like ÖPNV, sharing services, or cycling infrastructure. Lists and surveys that provide data or sections specifically about “Verkehrsmittel” (e.g., vacation travel reports with transport-mode breakdowns) are relevant, while documents that only mention the term in passing without analysis or data are weakly relevant. Historical or educational contexts are relevant if they describe the role or selection of transport modes (e.g., school traffic education or the emergence of new urban transport systems), but travel pieces focused solely on destinations or motives without any transport-mode information would be non-relevant. Edge cases include documents using synonyms or specific vehicle types without the keyword (still relevant) and legal or environmental texts: they are relevant only when they explicitly address transport modes or their regulation, not when they discuss climate or rights in general terms.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking surveys or datasets about transportation modes—public transport, car, bicycle, walking—covering factors that drive mode choice, accessibility, frequency of use, and satisfaction, alongside environmental attitudes and demographics. They likely want findings on commuting and travel behavior and the impact of policy measures in Germany.</desc>
	<narr>Documents are relevant if they discuss transport modes (Verkehrsmittel) explicitly, such as mode choice, usage frequency, accessibility, headways, satisfaction, or attributes like cost, speed, flexibility, safety, and environmental impact; examples include surveys on ÖPNV (bus, tram, U-Bahn, S-Bahn, Regionalbahn), car ownership and licensing, taxi and bicycle use, Semesterticket/BahnCard possession, and combinations of modes for commuting, shopping, or leisure. Content covering attitudes and policies tied to mode choice—e.g., readiness to switch from car to public transport under certain conditions, evaluations of measures like cheaper ÖPNV or car restrictions, or environmental beliefs affecting mode selection—is also highly relevant. Vacation and weekend mobility modules remain relevant when they record the transport used for trips or the reasons for choosing one mode over another. Documents are non-relevant if they only mention the term in passing (e.g., a demographics section with no mode information) or discuss traffic/policy in the abstract without reference to specific transport modes or their use. Edge cases include health or local-quality-of-life surveys that record the mode to the doctor or city center (still relevant), and datasets where “Verkehrsmittelwahl” or variable lists enumerate modes without narrative (minimally but still relevant due to explicit mode coverage).</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking to identify which transport mode(s) people use to travel to work or school — specifically the main (primary) mode, any additional modes, the mode used for the longest part of the trip, and the mode used on the outbound (Hinweg) journey. This is for classifying or recording commute modes such as walking, bicycle, car, bus, tram, train, or motorcycle.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant when it explicitly discusses "Verkehrsmittel" or synonymous phrases in the context of commuting (e.g., Verkehrsmittelwahl auf Arbeitsweg, Hinweg, für die längste Wegstrecke) and lists or asks about specific modes such as Auto, Bus, Fahrrad, Eisenbahn, Straßenbahn, Motorrad/Moped, or "Keine Verkehrsmittel" (walk). For example, survey items like "Und welches Verkehrsmittel benutzen Sie da hauptsächlich" or records tagged EF134/EF194 that link a transport mode to Arbeitsstätte/Schule are highly relevant because they directly capture mode choice. Documents are non-relevant if they mention vehicles only in unrelated contexts (freight logistics, vehicle maintenance, traffic law), contain only opaque codes with no mode mapping, or are mere duplicates without new content. Edge cases include entries labeled "weitere Verkehrsmittel" (which requires inspection to see what additional modes are meant), "Keine Verkehrsmittel" (which may imply walking), region-specific tags like HVV or DC1800P (which increase relevance if the query targets that system), and partial fragments that nonetheless contain the primary-mode question—these should be considered potentially relevant but may need disambiguation.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user likely wants to know what "Verkehrsmittel" means in this context — i.e., modes or means of transportation — and how it is treated in the SEU scale. Specifically, they want to understand that transport use is one of seven content domains in the SEU, measured by items assessing awareness of the ecological consequences of one’s transport choices and related self-reported behaviors.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "verkehrsmittel" when it explicitly treats means of transport or transport use (e.g., verkehrsmittelnutzung, verkehrsmittelwahl) as a substantive topic—particularly in relation to environmental attitudes, behavioral intentions, or the ecological consequences of transport choices, such as studies using the SEU scale or items that measure awareness of action consequences. Good examples are surveys comparing car versus public-transport use, questionnaires that include the four-item awareness-of-consequences measure for transport behavior, or papers that apply Maloney & Ward or Schwartz’s scales to transport-related pro-environmental actions. Documents are non-relevant if the term appears only in a list or as a passing example, or if the focus is technical (vehicle engineering, timetables, traffic law) with no connection to attitudes, behavior, or environmental impact. Edge cases include translated or compound forms (verkehrsmittelnutzung) which are relevant when they report specific measures or findings, but only moderately relevant when the mention is peripheral (e.g., a single item in a broad multi-domain scale).</narr>

<title>politische orientierung</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks information on political orientation—its definition, formation, and measurement—drawing on empirical studies in Germany, especially among youth. They want to know which social, moral, educational, religious, media, and cultural factors shape these orientations and how they influence democratic attitudes and participation.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it defines, measures, or explains political orientations—attitudes, values, and positions toward politics and institutions—such as authoritarianism, nationalism, left–right self-placement, democratic values, or participation, especially when grounded in empirical data (e.g., ALLBUS, World Values Survey) or tied to political socialization. Studies on specific populations or contexts—youth in East/West Germany, children’s early political understanding, confessional ties, local democracy in a city like Mannheim, or cross-national comparisons in Eastern Europe—are directly on-topic when they analyze determinants and patterns of citizens’ orientations. Works that discuss “moralische Orientierungen” are relevant only if they connect these moral frames to citizens’ political orientations or their incorporation into decision processes; purely normative theory without such linkage is marginal. Items focused on institutional rules, higher-education policy designs, or organizational reforms are non-relevant if “Orientierung” refers to policy frameworks rather than people’s political attitudes. Clear relevance signals include terms like Einstellungen, Werte, politische Kultur, Links–Rechts, Autoritarismus, Toleranz, Partizipation, and analyses of media or youth culture shaping political orientations; non-relevant edge cases include “Orientierung” as general guidance, navigation, or unrelated domains (e.g., study orientation sessions, sexual orientation).</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking studies and datasets that define and measure political orientation (e.g., left–right, liberal–authoritarian, pro/anti-EU) and examine how it forms and diffuses. They want evidence from German/European contexts on determinants like socialization and networks and how orientations relate to party preferences, issue attitudes, and participation across groups such as students, youth, and the general public.</desc>
	<narr>Documents are relevant if they explicitly measure, model, or discuss political orientation, such as ideological self-placement (e.g., left–right scales), party identification or sympathy thermometers (SPD, CDU/CSU, FDP, etc.), liberal–authoritarian or multiculturalism–ethnocentrism scales, or attitudes toward democracy, extremism bans, coalitions, or national/European integration. Highly relevant examples include surveys of political attitudes and socialization, network diffusion of political orientations, coded analyses of party manifestos positioned on ideological dimensions, or studies linking values to party preferences. Documents are non-relevant if “orientation” refers to non-political constructs (e.g., time orientation, lifestyle or group-style orientation, technical/computer orientation) or if politics is merely background without measuring political stance. Edge cases include domain-specific political orientations (e.g., university politics or East–West alignment), which are still relevant but narrower; datasets where political orientation appears only as a control or demographic field, which are weakly relevant; and historical content analyses of political language that infer ideology, which are relevant if they derive clear orientation measures. Mentions of “orientation” as guidance, onboarding, or geographic orientation without ideological content are not relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants to know the political orientation and current/future political direction of actors such as the CDU/CSU, SPD and Greens, and of the EU — e.g., whether the CDU is moving left and whether parties should cooperate. They also seek comparisons of political conditions in the former GDR versus today and public tolerance toward people with different political views.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "politische orientierung" if it discusses the ideological direction or alignment of actors (parties, groups, or individuals), asks or reports whether a party is shifting left/right, or records people’s self-described political orientation and attitudes toward cooperation. For example, items like "CDU politically developing to the left," questions about whether the Greens or CDU/CSU should seek closer cooperation, or survey questions on tolerance for politically different opinions directly match the query. Documents that are non-relevant include noisy metadata and repeated codes (e.g., V288, V235), administrative labels (municipality size class) or datasets that only list technical sampling information without ideological content. Edge cases: texts about the EU’s future or DDR comparisons are relevant only when they treat ideological/political orientation (not purely economic or historical descriptions); survey question wording is useful, but raw response matrices or purely procedural documentation are less valuable.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking documentation and validated survey instruments for measuring political orientation (e.g., left–right self-placement) and related socio-political attitudes in German/European studies, along with pretest methods. This includes scales on efficacy, cynicism, redistribution, immigration/asylum, climate change, antisemitism, gender equality, and conservatism from projects like PAWCER, FGZ/ZHP, CSES Module 5, AUTNES, and FReDA.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly defines or measures political orientation (e.g., a Left–Right scale, redistribution/inequality items, or instruments like SECS GER for social/economic conservatism) or reports survey modules/panels that record respondents’ political orientations and related attitudes (e.g., CSES Module 5, the FGZ Zusammenhaltspanel, PAWCER pretests on Left–Right and redistribution). Materials on adjacent political dispositions such as political efficacy (PEKS) or political cynicism (KPZ), or issue attitudes commonly used to infer ideology (e.g., asylum policy items, immigration, climate change) are also relevant when they are tied to locating respondents on a political spectrum. By contrast, instruments about non-political “orientations” (e.g., collective orientation in teams, causal orientation from self-determination theory, religious or family-climate scales), managerial practice surveys, or general online-survey documentation are non-relevant. Edge cases include value-orientation batteries (e.g., “ökologisch-alternative” or “konservativer Konformismus”) that may count if explicitly linked to ideological placement, and studies of political participation (e.g., DDR participation) that are only relevant if they assess orientation rather than behavior alone. Mentions of “sexuelle Orientierung” are false positives for this query.</narr>

<title>technology</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an academic overview of technology as a sociotechnical phenomenon—covering philosophies and sociology of technology, measurement and indicators (e.g., technological sovereignty, readiness), diffusion and transfer, and cultural and gender dimensions. They likely want frameworks and evidence to guide technology decision-making, assessment, and policy across education, industry, and national contexts.</desc>
	<narr>For the query “technology,” a document is relevant when technology itself is the central object of analysis—its development, governance, measurement, transfer, or social impacts—whether theoretical (e.g., philosophy of technology, constructivist accounts) or applied (e.g., technological sovereignty metrics, technology transfer models, readiness assessment tools). Examples that qualify include studies of K–12 technology leadership philosophies, algorithms for measuring technological independence, economics of technology and diffusion across generations, feminist technology studies, AI’s co-evolution with society, and care-sensitive technology assessment, because they interrogate technological artifacts, practices, or decision-making. Documents are non-relevant when “technology” appears only tangentially (such as in institutional names or passing references) or when the core topic is unrelated (e.g., general policy or culture pieces) without substantive analysis of technologies themselves. Edge cases—like culturally focused analyses, advertising “mood” technologies, or historical accounts of protectionism—are relevant if they examine technological mechanisms, metrics, or design implications; otherwise they are borderline. Signals of higher relevance include “technology/technological/tech/AI/ICT/innovation” in the title or abstract and sustained discussion where technology is central rather than incidental.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks surveys and datasets on attitudes toward and adoption of technology, and their perceived impacts on work, environment, economy, health, and daily life, with detailed demographic variables. This includes European and German studies on ICT/5G, biotechnology and genetics, digital media, and industrial automation, as well as company- and worker-level data on technology use, skills, and training.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if technology is a primary focus—its adoption, use, impacts, or public attitudes—such as surveys on acceptance of gene technology and biotechnology, public opinion on 5G, studies of ICT use by managers, or company-level use of CAD/CNC, PPS, and automation. Content that analyzes technological change or policy (e.g., patent-based measures of innovation waves, nuclear power attitudes, multimedia and communication tech in daily life, or digital behavior and competence) is also squarely relevant. By contrast, documents that only mention “technology” tangentially (e.g., as a demographic code, a background variable, or in a proper name like “Institute of Technology”) without substantive discussion should be treated as non-relevant. Edge cases include broad social surveys (e.g., Eurobarometer) that touch many topics: they are relevant if the technology module is substantial, but low-relevance if technology appears only as a minor item. Likewise, texts about “technique,” “technicalities,” or generic “skills” without reference to technological artifacts, systems, or digital infrastructure should be considered non-relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>Someone searching for "technology" here is likely looking for survey items or a way to measure public interest, awareness, and attitudes toward technology. They want to assess things like personal interest and informedness about science and tech, perceived regional leadership in ICT use, expected impacts of emerging technologies over the next 20 years, information sources, and the future role of space-derived technologies.</desc>
	<narr>This document is relevant to the query "technology" because it repeatedly names technology-related topics (e.g., "A5 Technology," "science and technology," "information and communication technologies," "Internet," "mobile telephone," and "space derived technologies") and contains question items about interest, awareness, and perceived effects of new technologies. It is specifically a survey questionnaire, so it is especially useful if the query intent is about public attitudes, survey design, questionnaire items, or measuring interest in technology (for example, researchers looking for response scales like "1 Not at all" to "4 Very much"). It would be non-relevant for intents seeking technical explanations, implementation details, code, or product specifications — this text contains no technical descriptions or how-to guidance. Edge cases: noisy formatting and repeated prompt tokens (FW2, Present list, duplicated lines) may lower precision in retrieval but could help if the user wants examples of survey wording or repeated-item validation.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is looking for validated psychological measures and definitions related to attitudes toward technology — specifically a short, psychometrically tested "technology commitment" (Technikbereitschaft) scale that predicts successful use of new technologies (especially in older adults) and its three facets: technology acceptance, competence, and control beliefs. They also want information on a technophobia questionnaire that measures fear of technology across three dimensions: personal failure, human-versus-machine problems, and usability.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "technology" when it centrally addresses people’s interactions with, attitudes toward, or measurement of responses to technology—for example studies that develop or validate scales of technology commitment, technology acceptance, competence, control beliefs, or technophobia. The provided paragraph is highly relevant because it reports the creation and psychometric validation of a short scale (Technikbereitschaft/TB) and a related questionnaire assessing technophobia across clear dimensions (personal failure, human-versus-machine, and usability), with application to predicting technology use in older adults. Documents that focus on technical specifications, engineering design, code, or hardware performance without considering human attitudes or adoption would be non-relevant even if they repeatedly use the word “technology.” Edge cases include research on digital literacy, usability, or policy: these are partially relevant when they measure or aim to change users’ readiness or fear of technology, but less relevant if they only discuss infrastructure, cost, or regulatory issues without human-centered measures.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks an overview of scholarly and policy perspectives on sport as a social and economic institution, including management and marketing, commercialization and governance/legal frameworks, inclusion and gender equity, youth development, media representation, nationalism, and sport tourism. They want evidence on participation determinants, program sustainability, and European policy initiatives (EU, Council of Europe) related to sport and physical activity.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “sport” if it substantively discusses athletic activities or the sports sector—such as sports management and marketing, governance and policy (e.g., EU White Paper on Sport), participation and inclusion (women in sport, disability sport), facilities and coaching, media and journalism, or social impacts like nationalism and health. Empirical studies, case reports, or reviews about sports organizations, funding models, event tourism, safeguarding, or the effects of sporting success all count as relevant, even when the focus is administrative or sociological rather than on gameplay. Documents are non-relevant when “sport” appears only as a homograph or substring (to sport a jacket, plant “sport” in biology, SPORT as an unrelated acronym, or words like transport/support/passport), or when it refers to non-athletic “sport mode” in cars or fashion labels. Edge cases include esports (often treated as relevant if framed within sport governance or participation), motorsport (relevant as an athletic domain), and media about a newspaper named “Sport,” which is relevant only if the content pertains to sports coverage rather than corporate matters.</narr>

<research_data>
	<desc>Find survey datasets on sports participation and attitudes, including leisure activities, club membership, facility access, barriers, and demographics. The goal is to analyze determinants and impacts of sport engagement—its links to life goals, work/family expectations, health behaviors, social values, and local sport offerings/policies—across different populations.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “sport” when it substantively discusses athletic activity or its context, such as participation and frequency of leisure sport, motivations and barriers, facilities and equipment, club membership, competitions or festivals (e.g., Spartakiade), training intensity, or the financing and organization of sport clubs. Omnibus materials remain relevant if they include dedicated sections on sport (for example, surveys that pair attitudes to Hungary or the EU with detailed modules on sport participation, facilities, or club judgments). References to specific disciplines (soccer, long-distance running, swimming), sport badges/certificates, or evaluations of local sport centers also indicate strong relevance. By contrast, documents that only mention “sport” in passing, or match the string as part of unrelated words or names (e.g., transport, passport, or institution names without substantive athletic content) are non-relevant; an edge case is institutional or student-life surveys that are only relevant if they include explicit sport-motivation or activity modules.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user needs a concise summary of survey items about sport and physical activity, covering how often people exercise, where they do it, attitudes toward sport (e.g., too much sport on TV, whether sport brings groups together), and perceived benefits (health, social ties, character building, helping disadvantaged). This information would support designing or analyzing a questionnaire on participation, venues, opinions, and outcomes of sport.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "sport" when it explicitly addresses physical activity or organized sports — for example by asking how often people exercise, listing venues (fitness centre, sports club, park, at home, at work, school), or discussing perceived benefits and opinions (improved health, meeting other cultures, “too much sport on TV”). Concrete survey items, variable codes (qd7, v199, Q12b, etc.), and repeated question text in the paragraph indicate strong topical focus and make the document highly relevant for queries about sport participation, venues, attitudes, or health outcomes. A document is non‑relevant if the word “sport” appears only metaphorically, in an unrelated industry name, or when the content is about TV programming logistics without any link to physical activity or sport participation. Edge cases include materials that are highly relevant for research (questionnaire forms, variable lists) but low in narrative content, ambiguous usages like “e‑sport” or brand names that may not match the user’s intent, and documents that only discuss elite spectator events — relevant topically but focusing on a different facet of “sport.”</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking information on a psychological measurement tool related to sport, specifically a scale that assesses adolescents’ body experience and perceived sporting competence, including its subscales and related constructs.</desc>
	<narr>This paragraph is only tangentially relevant to the query “sport” because its primary focus is a 73‑item psychometric scale about adolescents’ body experience, not sports activities, events, or rules. It does, however, include a subscale on “perceived sporting competence” and related constructs like physical self-presentation, which can matter in sports psychology or sport science contexts. If the user’s intent is to find measures of sport competence or research on how adolescents perceive their athletic abilities, this document is relevant; for general sports news, training programs, or information about specific sports, it is not. An edge case is keyword matching where “sporting” triggers inclusion despite the document offering no practical guidance on sport participation, teams, or performance metrics.</narr>

They also want comparative case studies across Europe, Russia, and the Americas and normative debates on whether populism threatens or revitalizes democracy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly analyzes Populismus as a political concept, for example by defining it, tracing its historical roots, outlining typologies, or debating its relationship to democracy, such as in discussions of Müller vs. Mudde/Kaltwasser or Rosanvallon/Lefort/Laclau/Mouffe. Case studies that situate populism in concrete contexts—e.g., AfD/PEGIDA, FPÖ/Haider, Le Pen, Berlusconi, Latin American movements, or Russia’s use of anti-populist repression and comparisons with Putin/Trump—are clearly relevant, as are works on populist communication (people vs. elites, exclusion of minorities), fake news classifications, and media logic (personalization, emotionalization). Empirical studies using surveys (e.g., ALLBUS), network analyses of misinformation, or research on determinants like recognition, political knowledge, or post-democratic mediatization also count as relevant. Non-relevant items are those that only name “Populismus” in passing, use the term as a loose insult or stylistic label without conceptual treatment, or focus on other ideologies without linking them to populism’s logic and effects. Edge cases include broad democracy or totalitarianism essays that mention populism only as a foil, or historical notes (e.g., invoking Abraham Lincoln) that are relevant only if they tie back to the modern concept and its mechanisms.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks survey datasets and research on populism in Germany and Europe, focusing on how populist attitudes are measured, their distribution and determinants, and their effects on voting behavior and democratic representation. Relevant sources include CSES Module 5, ValCon, ALLBUS 2018, GLES, and the German Internet Panel, with attention to sampling and fieldwork modes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “populismus” if it substantively examines populism as an ideology, party family, or set of citizen attitudes, or if it provides data and instruments to measure it. Examples include surveys or projects focused on populism (e.g., CSES Module 5 on the politics of populism, the ValCon project on social media and the rise of populism), or datasets that contain explicit populism scales and items such as “people vs. corrupt elites,” anti-compromise statements, demands for referendums, or claims that “politicians talk too much and act too little” (as in ALLBUS, GLES, and GIP). Documents that primarily present methodology or sampling can still be relevant when they include a populism module or enable analysis of populist attitudes, party competition, or effects on electoral behavior and democratic satisfaction. Non-relevant materials would discuss general politics without any populism construct, use “populist” only as a passing adjective, or focus on unrelated policy domains (e.g., taxation, health) without linking them to populism. Edge cases: German-language descriptions, repeated dataset summaries, or discussions of related constructs (trust, efficacy, national identity) are relevant only when explicitly tied to populism’s measurement or theorized effects.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants a clear, concise definition of "populism" and its distinguishing characteristics. They may also be looking for the different types (left/right), typical causes and rhetoric, and examples or political consequences to understand how the concept applies in practice.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "populismus" if it explicitly defines or analyzes populism—its core features (anti-elitism, people-versus-elite rhetoric, charismatic leadership, simplistic policy promises), its varieties (right-wing, left-wing, nativist), or concrete case studies (e.g., analyses of parties or leaders in Germany, Austria, the US, or Latin America). Empirical research, historical overviews, comparative studies, media- and discourse-analyses, and articles that measure or operationalize populism (indices, survey evidence, rhetorical coding) are highly relevant because they provide substantive explanation and examples. A document that merely mentions the word in passing, uses it as a political insult without conceptual clarity, or discusses unrelated topics that happen to contain the substring "populismus" is not relevant. Edge cases include opinion pieces or satire that use populismus rhetorically (partly relevant if they illuminate public perception), documents in other languages where the concept is analyzed under different labels, and news reports about protests or policies that imply populist dynamics but do not explicate them (these are partially relevant depending on depth).</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>A user searching "populismus" here wants to know whether and how perceived economic inequalities drive support for populist parties, and specifically whether experimentally providing factual information about income and wealth distribution changes perceived inequality and populist attitudes. They may also be looking for details and results of a pretest that evaluated the clarity and plausibility of two informational graphics about Germany’s income and wealth distribution (available in the pretest PDF).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant for the keyword "populismus" when it explicitly examines populism or populist attitudes — for example studies that link perceived inequality to support for right‑wing populist parties (as shown by ISSP findings naming the Progress Party in Norway, the Danish People’s Party, and Austria’s FPÖ) or projects that experimentally test whether information about income/wealth distribution changes populist preferences. The paragraph above is clearly relevant because it describes the "Perceived Inequalities and Populism" project and an experiment designed to measure causal effects on populist attitudes, even if the reported pretest only evaluated informational graphics. Documents are only partially relevant if they concern preparatory materials (e.g., graphic pretests or Web‑Probing methods) for a populism study but do not contain measures of populist attitudes or outcomes. Non‑relevant documents are those that discuss inequality, survey methodology, or political parties without any connection to populism, or that use "populism" metaphorically in unrelated fields. Edge cases include texts describing parties or movements that are populist in practice but not labeled as such (which may still be relevant) and cross‑national or left‑ vs right‑wing distinctions that require reading the content to judge relevance.</narr>

They also want practical policies and strategies—at both workplace and policy levels—to improve balance amid aging workforces, gender equity concerns, and economic pressures.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly discusses work-life (or work–family) balance—its drivers, programs, outcomes, and policies—such as analyses of organizational WLB initiatives during economic downturns, gendered experiences of balancing roles in academia, expatriate WLB in GCC countries, or critiques of Italian and European WLB practices and policy. Empirical or theoretical work that explicitly links job demands to family/personal life, measures WLB, or proposes models and tools (e.g., flexible schedules, care services, support networks) also fits, even if phrased as work life, work-life, or work–family balance. Content that addresses “worklife” broadly—aging at work, quality of European worklife, or call-center “areas of worklife”—is only marginally relevant unless it ties those themes to balancing work with nonwork domains. Uses of “balance” in unrelated senses (e.g., physical balance in soccer, constitutional balancing tests, current account balances, or balance of power in IR) are non-relevant despite keyword overlap. Edge cases include health and leisure studies; they are relevant when framed as mechanisms to improve WLB, but not when they report health or fitness outcomes without reference to balancing work and life.</narr>

<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks research and datasets on work-life balance: the interplay between paid work and unpaid care/family life, its determinants, and policy supports such as family leave. They are especially interested in evidence from European/German surveys on COVID-19’s effects and gender differences.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it examines how people reconcile paid employment with personal or family life and the supports or constraints shaping that, such as family leave, flexible work, unpaid care, time use, wellbeing, or gender differences. Clear examples here include the EU survey on COVID-19’s effects on work–life balance, the rural Germany survey that explicitly measures quality of life and work–life balance, and the platform work study assessing workers’ work patterns and work–life balance from a gender perspective. Documents are non-relevant when “balance” refers to economic accounting (e.g., balance of payments, trade balance, foreign exchange balances), historical monetary stocks, or when “work” refers to institutions or outputs rather than employment and private life. Edge cases include texts that only mention work–life balance in passing without measures or findings, analyses of work patterns that never connect to family/care or personal time, or alternative spellings (worklife, work-life) that are still relevant if the substance matches. Similarly, items about a “balance of power” in politics or “work of an organization” contain the keywords but are not about work–life balance and should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>Someone searching for "worklife balance" wants practical guidance on managing and harmonizing professional responsibilities with personal life and wellbeing, including time-management techniques, boundary-setting, and stress-reduction strategies. They may also be looking for employer policies and best practices (e.g., flexible hours, remote work), evidence of benefits, and relevant legal or organisational rights.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "worklife balance" if it directly addresses the balance between paid work and personal/family life — for example by describing flexible hours, remote work policies, parental leave, childcare provision, overtime, employee wellbeing, or measures and outcomes (surveys, incidence of burnout, productivity effects). Research papers comparing parental leave across countries, employer guidelines on flexible working, or surveys reporting how many people work long hours would be relevant; so would case studies of interventions that improved employees’ ability to manage work and home. The paragraph provided — a repeated set of survey prompts about EU membership, environmental effort, and gender balance on company boards — is not relevant because it focuses on political membership and environmental or governance questions rather than working hours, leave, or workplace policies; only if a section explicitly links board gender balance or EU policy to childcare/leave arrangements would it become tangentially relevant. Edge cases include documents that mention "work" or "life" only in passing (not relevant) and pieces about related socioeconomic topics (e.g., labor law, productivity, gender equality) which are relevant only when they specifically discuss mechanisms or outcomes that affect individuals’ ability to combine work and personal life.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “worklife balance” if it discusses the interplay between work and personal life, such as policies (flexible hours, parental leave), strategies (boundary-setting, remote-work practices), outcomes (stress, burnout, satisfaction), or empirical findings linking work arrangements to well-being and family responsibilities. The provided paragraph is non-relevant because it focuses on survey methodology (mixed-mode surveys), ethical issues in digital behavioral data, and an authoritarian attitudes scale; its use of “balance” (e.g., “sample balance”) is methodological, not about balancing work and life. Examples of relevant content include studies on flexible scheduling reducing burnout, guides for managers on preventing after-hours email overload, or statistics on overtime’s impact on family time. Edge cases: a methods paper could be relevant only if it applies those methods to measure work–life balance specifically; documents that mention “work” and “life” separately or discuss unrelated constructs (e.g., right-wing authoritarianism) without connecting them to work–life outcomes are not.</narr>

They want evidence and recommendations on EU age policies, age management practices, demographic differences in engagement, and social risk management for career transitions.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “worklife” if it substantively discusses working life, work-life balance/quality, or “areas of worklife” (e.g., management practices, aging at work, engagement, fairness, workload, control, community, values), even when using variants like “work life,” “work-life,” or non-English equivalents such as German “Arbeitsleben.” For example, chapters analyzing European worklife and age management, or studies of call center agents’ work engagement linked to areas of worklife, directly match the query. Documents addressing policies and risks across the life course of employment (e.g., transitional labor markets or “worklife insurance”) are also relevant because they center on conditions and transitions in working life. By contrast, texts that only mention “worklife” in passing, use it metaphorically, or focus solely on unrelated biographical methods without connecting to working conditions or employment contexts are non-relevant. Edge cases include branded terms like “WorkLife” (a program name), duplicate abstracts, or content in other languages; these can still be relevant if the substance concerns working life rather than a namesake or fleeting mention.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "worklife" when it directly addresses work–life balance, reconciliation of employment and family responsibilities, work–life conflict, working hours, leave arrangements, childcare/eldercare, telework or measures that affect how paid work and private life interact. For example, the paragraph cites explicit modules and papers on "WorkLife Conflict and Self‑Rated Health," EU ad‑hoc modules on "Reconciliation between work and family life," measures of working time, childcare arrangements and parental leave, and surveys asking about home‑office or reduced hours—all strong relevance signals. Documents that are non‑relevant merely mention “work” or “life” in passing, are pure metadata/technical codebooks, or focus solely on unrelated topics (e.g., raw occupational codes, broad political opinion items) without variables linking employment to family or well‑being; however some COVID‑surveys that concentrate on infection risk may be borderline relevant if they also contain questions about changes in work situation, childcare or home‑office. Edge cases include long instrument descriptions or multilingual repeats: these can still be useful if they list specific variables (hours worked, childcare responsibility, leave taken, satisfaction with work–family balance), but should be judged on whether those variables or substantive analyses are actually present.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>A user searching "worklife" wants to assess how their job responsibilities affect their personal life, specifically measuring how often work duties interfere with private life (often/sometimes/rarely/never). This is part of a broader survey about impressions of everyday places and people.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "worklife" when it explicitly addresses the relationship between work and private life — for example discussions of where people work, how job tasks or duties affect home life, commuting, working hours, or questions about work–life balance. The provided paragraph is highly relevant because it mentions "wo Sie ... arbeiten" (where you work) and directly asks how frequently professional duties impair private life, which ties squarely to worklife issues. A document is non-relevant if it only lists everyday locations or gives general survey instructions and Likert scales without any linkage to employment, job demands, or effects on personal life. Edge cases include texts that use the word "work" in other senses (e.g., "work of art," mechanical "working" devices), brief passing mentions of employment status without discussing impacts on private life, or multilingual repetitions and boilerplate that dilute the substantive work–life content.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "worklife" when it directly addresses the relationship between work and other life domains or workplace conditions — for example studies or survey modules on work–life balance, working hours, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, workplace mobbing, or digital skills used at work. Concrete signals of relevance include survey questions or scales targeted at work-related constructs (e.g., ISSP work–life items, work–family conflict scales, the Luxembourg Workplace Mobbing Scale, or modules on ICT at work) and empirical results about employees’ or self‑employed persons’ working situations. Documents are non‑relevant when they focus on unrelated topics (household ICT use with no workplace module, purely methodological notes that do not cover work content, or instruments whose items are strictly about private life), even if they happen to contain the word “work” in metadata. Edge cases include methodological or translation reports — these are relevant only if they pertain to a workplace module or validate a work‑related scale; similarly, mixed‑scope instruments (e.g., ICT competence scales covering both private and work contexts) may be partially relevant depending on whether the workplace domain is analyzed separately.</narr>

<title>fremdenfeindlichkeit</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking a research-based overview of xenophobia (Fremdenfeindlichkeit) in Germany, including its prevalence and East–West differences, key drivers (relative deprivation, education, family dynamics, social integration/identity), and how it is measured in surveys like ALLBUS. They also want evidence on trends and effective prevention or policy responses at community and national levels.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it focuses on Fremdenfeindlichkeit (xenophobia) or close synonyms (e.g., Ausländerfeindlichkeit) by analyzing attitudes, behaviors, or crimes against foreigners, especially with empirical measures, determinants, or trends (e.g., ALLBUS-based studies, East–West differences, effects of education, deprivation, or intergroup contact). Also relevant are works that explicitly link xenophobia to related constructs or contexts—such as antisemitism, nationalism/patriotism, youth and family dynamics, or community prevention—when they test or discuss causal pathways, interventions, or policy programs (e.g., EUMC reports, XENOS/EQUAL) in relation to xenophobic outcomes. Broad reports on racism or discrimination qualify only if they contain dedicated sections quantifying or explaining xenophobia in Germany or the EU and make that linkage explicit. Non-relevant are documents on general crime, youth violence, or social policy that do not measure, compare, or discuss xenophobia, as well as identity or migration pieces that omit xenophobic attitudes or incidents. Edge cases include incidental or metaphorical uses of the term and purely historical overviews without analytical content (exclude), while studies of right-wing extremism or group-focused enmity (GMF) are included only when they directly assess xenophobic attitudes, behaviors, or their predictors.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking survey-based data and measures of xenophobia (Fremdenfeindlichkeit) and related prejudices (e.g., racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia), along with their socio-economic, political, and demographic correlates and trends. They want datasets and instruments from German and European studies (e.g., Thüringen Monitor, Eurobarometer) to analyze prevalence, contexts, and changes over time.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “fremdenfeindlichkeit” if it directly examines xenophobia—such as attitudes toward foreigners, xenophobic behavior or violence, measurement scales, policy preferences about immigration, or its links to related prejudices like racism or Islamophobia. The provided paragraph is highly relevant because it repeatedly lists Fremdenfeindlichkeit as a measured construct in surveys (e.g., Thüringen Monitor, Eurobarometer), details items like frequency of hostile remarks toward foreigners, reactions to attacks, contact with migrants, and associated scales (authoritarianism, social dominance, antisemitism). Content using close synonyms or operationalizations—Ausländerfeindlichkeit, xenophobic violence, right‑wing extremism, willingness to live near foreigners, or support for restrictive immigration—also qualifies. Non‑relevant would be texts where the term appears only in passing without analysis (e.g., a generic list with no data or discussion) or where “fremd” refers to unrelated topics like tourism (Fremdenverkehr) or abstract “fear of the unfamiliar” not tied to out‑groups. Edge cases include media content analyses: they are relevant if they assess how xenophobia is portrayed (e.g., word choices, framing), but not if they merely quote headlines without addressing xenophobia itself.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants a definition and explanation of xenophobia in Germany and information about how widespread it is, including public perceptions and prevalence of anti-foreigner attitudes and incidents.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "fremdenfeindlichkeit" if it explicitly discusses xenophobia—its definition, causes, prevalence or specific incidents in Germany—using data, news reporting, studies, legal analysis, policy responses, or first‑hand testimony. Examples of highly relevant content include government or NGO reports on hate crimes, academic articles measuring anti‑immigrant attitudes in German surveys, news stories about attacks on migrants, and legal commentary on statutes addressing xenophobic acts. Documents that only mention the term in passing, repeat a question like "Was meinen Sie ist Fremdenfeindlichkeit...?" without elaboration, or use similarly spelled but unrelated words (e.g., "Fremdenverkehr" meaning tourism) are not relevant. Edge cases include forum posts and opinion pieces—these can be relevant if they provide concrete examples or insight but are weaker than empirical studies—and English analyses or comparative research that focus on xenophobia in Germany are relevant even when the German term is translated. Finally, metadata tags or repeated codes (e.g., V174, V190) without substantive text are insufficient to establish relevance.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user wants a clear definition and overview of "Fremdenfeindlichkeit" (xenophobia), including how it is measured in survey research—e.g., consumer ethnocentrism scales, attitude-toward-foreigners items, and law-and-order measures—and wants information on instrument development, validation, and theoretical background.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "fremdenfeindlichkeit" if it explicitly addresses attitudes toward foreigners or xenophobia, for example by reporting scales, item batteries, or theoretical accounts of ethnocentrism and anti-foreign prejudice (such as the consumer ethnocentrism scale, ALLBUS items, Jacobys 1978, or law-and-order positions derived from Fend). The paragraph you supplied is relevant because it documents instruments that operationalize attitudes toward foreigners (e.g., a four‑item scale in ALLBUS) and links consumer ethnocentrism to moral and economic arguments against buying foreign goods. It would be less relevant if it only treated product preferences or marketing behavior without connecting those preferences to hostile beliefs about foreigners, or if it contained only statistical/methodological details with no attitudinal content. Borderline cases include studies of consumer ethnocentrism that focus purely on purchase intention (partially relevant) and "law-and-order" measures that may capture xenophobia when they explicitly target "everything foreign" but could instead reflect non‑xenophobic crime concerns. Finally, documents that lack information on instrument development, validation, or theoretical background (as noted in the paragraph) are still topically relevant but less useful for rigorous research until those details are obtained.</narr>

<title>happiness</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks research-based insights on how happiness (subjective well-being) is defined and measured, its key determinants, and how it varies across countries and over time. They want evidence on the roles of economic conditions, health, relationships, and public policies (including inequality and recall bias effects) and the implications for policy and population health.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly analyzes happiness or subjective well-being, including its measurement, determinants, trends, or policy uses—such as cross-national surveys, the World Happiness Report, or findings linking happiness to factors like marriage, income, health, unemployment, and inequality. Content discussing methodological issues (e.g., recall bias in “happiness five years ago,” distinctions between experienced utility and decision utility, or differences between happiness and life satisfaction) is also relevant because it shapes how happiness data are interpreted. Studies of specific groups or settings—parents vs. nonparents, people living with HIV, workplace happiness, or regional/cultural variations—are relevant when they explicitly connect results to happiness or life satisfaction. By contrast, pieces that use “happiness” only as a metaphor, a brand/title, or that focus solely on other outcomes (health, income, economics) without linking them to happiness are non-relevant. Edge cases include documents centered on “well-being,” “life satisfaction,” or “subjective well-being” without the exact keyword; these can be relevant if they clearly operationalize or compare happiness constructs, while work on inequality or the economy is relevant only when tied to levels or distributions of happiness.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>Identify surveys/datasets that measure happiness and life satisfaction and include rich covariates—especially alcohol use—alongside health, work, family, social networks, political attitudes, and demographics. The goal is to analyze determinants and cross-national patterns of subjective well-being across diverse populations and contexts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly measures or analyzes happiness as a psychological state or outcome, such as items on “feeling of happiness,” a “happiness scale,” general contentment with life or life satisfaction, or dependence of happiness on factors (e.g., work, partnership, money). Surveys focused on other domains (alcohol use, politics, EU integration, family, imprisonment) are relevant only when they explicitly include happiness or well-being measures, like “assessment of current contentment with life,” “associations with the term happiness,” or “self assessment of psychological well-being.” Non-relevant documents discuss those domains without any link to happiness or only provide demographics/interviewer ratings. Edge cases include uses of “happy” in narrower contexts—such as “happy partnership,” “a woman must have children to be happy,” or attitude items like “happy life without family”—which hit the keyword but may be tangential if they don’t assess overall well-being. Synonyms and related constructs (well-being, life satisfaction, contentment) should be treated as relevant signals.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for survey items and measures to assess personal happiness and its causes. Specifically they want questions about current overall happiness (very/fairly/not too), recent feelings of happiness, whether one needs a family to be happy, and ranking key factors (good health, children, a successful marriage).</desc>
	<narr>This paragraph is highly relevant to the keyword "happiness" because it contains many explicit mentions (including spelling variants like "happyness") and multiple direct survey items asking about being happy, felt happy in the past month, and whether family, health, children, or marriage are important for happiness. It is particularly useful if the user is looking for survey questions, instruments, or data-gathering language about subjective well‑being and related domains (mental health, overall life satisfaction). However, large amounts of repeated text and metadata tokens (v84, Q226, fn01, etc.) add noise and reduce the document’s informational value for someone seeking theory, analysis, or empirical findings. Edge cases: if the searcher wants philosophical definitions or statistical results on happiness, this paragraph is only partially relevant; if they want questionnaire items or examples of prompts, it is ideal. For ranking, boost documents with substantive discussion or results about happiness and de‑prioritize those that are mainly duplicated lines or metadata.</narr>

	<desc>The user is looking for validated ways to measure happiness and subjective well-being, including multi-item survey scales and the Human Flourishing Scale (Flourish Index and Secure Flourish Index) and the domains they assess.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly examines happiness as a construct—its definition, determinants, or measurement—such as describing survey items, scales, or indices that assess happiness and life satisfaction. Methodological discussions about measuring happiness (e.g., translation and validation of scales, subdomains that include happiness and life satisfaction) are also relevant, as in descriptions of the ISSP three-item happiness scale or the Flourish Index and Secure Flourish Index. Broader well-being or flourishing papers are relevant when they clearly include happiness as a dimension or report results for happiness-related subscales. Non-relevant items include texts that only use “happiness” as a passing phrase, brand name, or metaphor without analyzing the concept, or pieces focused solely on other domains (e.g., financial stability) without connecting them to happiness. Edge cases include documents on family or job satisfaction that serve as proxies for happiness (potentially relevant if the linkage is explicit) and measurement papers on “well-being” that omit a happiness component (likely not relevant).</narr>

They want to understand satisfaction levels, key determinants (e.g., training quality, instructors, learning environment), and how satisfaction relates to transition into employment and career outcomes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it examines satisfaction (Zufriedenheit) with vocational training/apprenticeships (Ausbildung), including global satisfaction and specific determinants such as instructor quality, learning venues (school vs company), methods, content, working conditions, or perceived usefulness of the training during or after the program. It remains relevant when it analyzes the transition from Ausbildung into employment and explicitly assesses satisfaction with the training or with vocational schools, or compares dual and school-based pathways. Documents are non-relevant if they focus on satisfaction in unrelated domains (e.g., democracy, marriage, general life satisfaction) or on job satisfaction without linking it to the training experience, even if “Ausbildung” is mentioned. Edge cases include tertiary or profession-specific “Ausbildung” (e.g., psychologists, teachers) or historical DDR cohorts—these are relevant only if they measure satisfaction with the training itself; studies where satisfaction is a small subsection are borderline but acceptable if they report concrete satisfaction indicators. Methodological notes or labor-market outcomes (income, status) without a satisfaction component should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks data or studies measuring satisfaction with vocational training (Ausbildung), especially survey items assessing trainees’ contentment with their training experience. They likely want variables on training quality, school–work balance, difficulties, outcomes, and background factors in German contexts (e.g., youth and DDR-era surveys).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly measures or discusses satisfaction in the context of training or apprenticeship (Ausbildung), such as “Zufriedenheit mit der Berufsausbildung,” “Ausbildungs- und Arbeitszufriedenheit,” or evaluations of vocational school quality, training conditions, and outcomes during or right after an apprenticeship. Materials that report determinants or consequences of training satisfaction—e.g., problems in the apprenticeship, alignment of school and workplace training, recognition as a trainer, or satisfaction with the time split between Berufsschule and on-the-job learning—also qualify. By contrast, content about satisfaction in unrelated domains (household income, housing, health, politics, magazine satisfaction) or documents that describe education/training structures without any satisfaction angle are non-relevant. Edge cases include uses of Ausbildung outside vocational contexts (e.g., vormilitary or political training), which may match the keyword but be off-topic if the focus is vocational training, and job satisfaction after graduation that is only relevant if it is clearly linked to the prior training experience. Mentions of “Zufriedenheit” only as a label in a codebook or scale list without substantive analysis are also borderline.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for information about satisfaction with education and vocational training (Ausbildung), typically to measure how satisfied people are with their own, their partner’s or their children’s schooling and training. They likely want to link satisfaction to respondents’ general school-leaving qualification, family background and views on which government (SPD/FDP vs. CDU/CSU) could best improve vocational education.</desc>
	<narr>This document is relevant if it directly addresses “Zufriedenheit” (satisfaction) with “Ausbildung” (education/training) or contains survey questions measuring respondents’ contentment with current vocational or school-based education. For example, items asking which education you would want for your children, whether your children have completed training, or whether the government (SPD/FDP vs. CDU/CSU) can improve vocational training are clearly on-topic because they probe satisfaction or perceived competence of the system. It is non-relevant when the text only lists administrative variable codes (V173, V230, etc.) or repeats prompts about general school-leaving certificates without any attitude or satisfaction measure. Edge cases include German-language prompts that inquire “wie es zurzeit ist” (how it is currently) or ask about improvements—these are relevant because they imply evaluative judgment—whereas political preference questions are only relevant if they explicitly link to respondents’ satisfaction with Ausbildung. Note that heavy duplication and template-like repetition reduces the document’s usefulness for assessing distinctive satisfaction content, though variable labels can still help map questions in a survey instrument.</narr>

	<desc>The user is looking for validated questionnaires to assess satisfaction with training/education—especially in firefighter and rescue service programs—including dimensions such as instructor behavior, structure, group dynamics, and learning outcomes, along with their psychometric evidence.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it addresses satisfaction within a training or educational context, such as instruments that evaluate trainees’ satisfaction with coursework, instructors, exercises, or the overall quality of an Ausbildung/Lehrgang. For example, the FIRE instruments for the training of rescue forces (including modules on plan exercises, deployment exercises, group work, instructor competence, and self-directed tasks) are highly relevant because they explicitly assess perceived training quality, learning processes, competence acquisition, and transfer, and report psychometric validity and reliability. By contrast, scales on life satisfaction (SWLS), residential satisfaction, satisfaction with a doctor visit, parental child-rearing dimensions, or national identification mention “Zufriedenheit” but are not about training, so they are non-relevant. Borderline cases include general job satisfaction or stress/burden and climate measures, which would only be relevant if applied specifically to trainees or apprenticeship settings. Also beware of false positives where “Ausbildung” refers to the formation of attitudes (e.g., nationalist value formation) rather than vocational or professional training.</narr>

	<narr>The query “zufriedenheit arbeit” most naturally targets job satisfaction—people’s satisfaction with their work, working conditions, employment terms, or workplace relationships. Documents are relevant when they measure or discuss Arbeitszufriedenheit or closely related constructs such as satisfaction with Arbeitsbedingungen, Betreuung/Supervision, Bezahlung, Work-life balance, or colleagues, for example surveys of DDR youths on work and living conditions, studies of early-career academics’ satisfaction with employment conditions and supervision, apprentices’ training satisfaction, or police studies that include satisfaction with colleagues. Studies that assess satisfaction with one’s “Beruf” or explicitly separate the work component within “Arbeits- und Lebensbedingungen” (including links to migration intentions or effects of performance appraisal on satisfaction) also fit. By contrast, items about “Zufriedenheit mit der Arbeit der Bundesregierung” or satisfaction with democracy/political developments are non-relevant, as are uses of “Arbeit” meaning “this paper/work” rather than employment, or pieces focused only on general life or leisure satisfaction without a work component. Edge cases include mixed-topic studies where work satisfaction is a minor variable (still weakly relevant) and lists of policy areas like Arbeitsmarktpolitik that mention “Arbeit” but do not measure job satisfaction (non-relevant).</narr>

<research_data>
	<desc>Find surveys and analyses on job satisfaction in Germany—how satisfied people are with their work and working conditions—including factors influencing it and variations by region, age, or occupation.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it measures or discusses job satisfaction—terms like Arbeitszufriedenheit, Zufriedenheit mit der Arbeit/den Arbeitsbedingungen, or satisfaction with pay, recognition, workload, work collective, shift work, and career prospects, often via scales or surveys. Examples include studies on shift systems and workers’ well-being, descriptions of workplace demands paired with job satisfaction scales, or youth/DDR surveys listing “Zufriedenheit mit Arbeitsbedingungen insgesamt und konkret.” By contrast, items such as “Zufriedenheit mit der Arbeit der Bundesregierung” or satisfaction with political developments, housing, or neighborhood services are non-relevant unless they explicitly tie back to one’s own job satisfaction. Edge cases include documents that only describe working conditions or employment characteristics without an explicit satisfaction measure—these are borderline but can be considered if they analyze determinants of job satisfaction. Synonyms and close formulations like Berufszufriedenheit, Zufriedenheit mit dem Beruf, or Zufriedenheit mit der Tätigkeit should be treated as relevant.</narr>

	<desc>Looking for information on "zufriedenheit arbeit" (job/work satisfaction): the user wants to know how work satisfaction is defined and measured (e.g., survey items like wanting to work even if not seeking work, frequency of time pressure, collaboration with others) and which factors — including workplace conditions and public policies — influence or improve employees' satisfaction.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "zufriedenheit arbeit" if it directly addresses job or employment satisfaction — for example survey questions or variables about how often people work under time pressure, whether they would like to work even if not seeking a job, satisfaction with their work, or collaboration with other self‑employed people in a work network. The paragraph contains some of these relevant items (e.g., "Wie oft arbeiten Sie bei der Erledigung Ihrer Arbeit unter Zeitdruck" and "Auch wenn Sie keine Arbeit suchen würden Sie dennoch gerne arbeiten"), so passages centered on those questions are pertinent. It is not relevant when the text is mainly about which party or government can solve federal budget, pensions, unemployment or broader economic problems (CDU/SPD competence, Bundeshaushalt, Terrorismusbekämpfung), unless those items explicitly link to individual job satisfaction or working conditions. Edge cases include mentions of "Zufriedenheit" that refer to satisfaction with government performance on employment policy — these are borderline relevant if the user’s intent includes satisfaction with employment policies rather than personal workplace satisfaction.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly addresses Arbeitszufriedenheit (job/work satisfaction) or closely related constructs in the workplace, such as satisfaction with pay, company evaluation, work climate, decision latitude, task variety, and psychological job demands. Examples include descriptions or validations of job satisfaction instruments, discussions of dimensions like self-fulfillment vs. resignation, or surveys like ALLBUS scales on importance of work attributes that explain determinants of job satisfaction. Content that focuses on other domains of satisfaction—e.g., Lebenszufriedenheit (SWLS), Wohnzufriedenheit (neighborhood/traffic safety/air quality), or satisfaction with a doctor visit—is non-relevant unless it explicitly links back to satisfaction with one’s work. Edge cases: measures of perceived job characteristics (e.g., decision-making scope, job demands) or Arbeitsorientierung can be relevant if tied to explaining or predicting work satisfaction, while general personality traits (procrastination, sensation seeking, health anxiety, social desirability) are not relevant unless analyzed as predictors of Arbeitszufriedenheit.

	<desc>The user is seeking empirical research and survey evidence on satisfaction (Zufriedenheit) across life, work, health, and political domains—primarily in Germany (and Poland)—including trends over time, regional differences, and key individual and economic determinants. They want to understand which factors (e.g., family, perceived control, education, employment conditions, and government performance) drive overall and domain-specific satisfaction and how this links to support for democracy.</desc>
	<narr>The most relevant documents explicitly analyze “Zufriedenheit” (satisfaction) as a core concept—ideally in German—and report concrete measures, determinants, or trends across domains such as life, democracy, health, and work (e.g., studies using ALLBUS, SOEP, or BIBB/IAB on Lebens- oder Demokratiezufriedenheit). Content that uses compound forms or close variants—Lebenszufriedenheit, Berufszufriedenheit, Demokratiezufriedenheit, Kundenzufriedenheit, and even Unzufriedenheit—and provides findings like East–West regional gaps, family influences, perceived control, or economic effects is clearly relevant. Documents are less relevant when the word appears only in passing, in boilerplate topic lists, or as a casual adjective (“wir sind zufrieden”) without definitions, scales, hypotheses, or empirical results. Related terms such as Glück or Wohlbefinden can still qualify if they explicitly link to satisfaction measures or outcomes; otherwise, well-being pieces that never mention Zufriedenheit are borderline. Edge cases include multilingual texts where “zufriedenheit” appears only in a citation, typos or casing variants, or policy newsletters that mention satisfaction in a headline but provide no substantive analysis—these should be ranked below studies that model satisfaction, report survey results, or compare groups.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks survey-based research and datasets on life satisfaction and quality of life across multiple domains—housing, income, health, work, family, safety, environment, and leisure—along with demographic correlates and future expectations. Emphasis is on East and West Germany (including the former GDR) with comparisons across cities, rural areas, and diverse groups (e.g., seniors, youth, prisoners, social workers), plus some international perspectives.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “zufriedenheit” if it explicitly mentions the German term or close variants and compounds (e.g., Lebenszufriedenheit, Arbeitszufriedenheit, Berufszufriedenheit, Zufriedenheit mit dem Einkommen/Wohnung/Gesundheit/Familienleben/Kirche/Sozialsystem, Zufriedenheitsindex) or describes measurements/scales of satisfaction (Skalometer, LSI). The provided paragraph is highly relevant because it repeatedly covers satisfaction across many domains: income and living standard, housing and neighborhood, health and healthcare, work and job conditions, partnership/family and childcare, social contacts, safety and crime, local politics and services, media programs, and seniors’ and prisoners’ satisfaction. Documents that discuss related constructs like Glücksgefühl (happiness), Wohlbefinden (well-being), Lebensqualität (quality of life), hopes/fears, or optimism without using the satisfaction keyword may be borderline—contextually related but possibly missed by a strict keyword match; negative forms like Unzufriedenheit are still relevant. Edge cases include morphological forms (zufrieden as adjective), instrument names (Zufriedenheitsindex, Lebenszufriedenheitsskala), or brief mentions within larger multi-topic surveys (still relevant), whereas passages limited to demographics, interviewer ratings, or procedural details without any satisfaction content are non-relevant.</narr>

It asks for satisfaction judgments across issues such as the federal budget, unemployment, the economy, debt reduction, pensions, price stability, environmental protection, agriculture and counter‑terrorism.</desc>
	<narr>This document is highly relevant because it repeatedly contains the phrase "zu Ihrer Zufriedenheit" and asks who could best solve problems "to your satisfaction," so it directly targets the concept queried by "zufriedenheit." It is a survey instrument focusing on satisfaction with government performance across many policy areas — e.g., federal budget consolidation, unemployment, economy, agriculture, environmental protection, price stability, pensions and debt — so any query about satisfaction with public problem‑solving would find concrete, topical examples here. Caveats: the text is question wording rather than measured satisfaction scores, and it contains many variable codes and duplicated lines (V116, v32, etc.), which is noisy and makes it less useful if you want survey results, analytical discussion, or theory of satisfaction. Edge cases that would be non‑relevant include documents that only mention "Zufriedenheit" in unrelated contexts (product or personal satisfaction), documents that use only a code or index label without human‑readable wording, or material in a different language if you require English. In short, this paragraph is relevant when you need examples of survey questions about citizens' satisfaction with government action, but less so if you need outcomes, summaries, or conceptual definitions of satisfaction.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses “Zufriedenheit” (satisfaction) as a construct or outcome, especially in domains like life satisfaction, job satisfaction, residential/neighborhood satisfaction, or patient satisfaction. Strong signals include use of established instruments and items (e.g., the SWLS five‑item life satisfaction scale; a 37‑item work satisfaction measure covering self‑actualization, resignation, pay satisfaction, and company appraisal) and psychometric details such as Rasch scalability or high reliability coefficients. Content that ties contextual criteria (child-friendliness, air quality, traffic safety) to positive/negative satisfaction judgments, or describes cognitive pretests of satisfaction questionnaires, also matches the query. Non-relevant documents merely mentioning related factors (traffic, workplace stress) without framing them in terms of satisfaction, or using “zufrieden/Unzufriedenheit” as a brand name or throwaway term, should be excluded. Edge cases include proxies like Lebensqualität (quality of life) being relevant when explicitly linked to satisfaction, and negated forms (Unzufriedenheit) which still fit if the focus is on (un)satisfaction.</narr>

<publication>
	<desc>The query seeks research-based insights into what drives life satisfaction, examining how personal, social, economic, environmental, and policy factors (e.g., materialism, commuting, family/partnership, SES, migration, economic freedom, austerity) relate to it. It emphasizes cross-national (especially European) evidence, mediators/moderators, and domain-specific links to inform measurement and policy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly measures, defines, or analyzes overall life satisfaction (subjective well-being), typically via survey items or scales (e.g., Eurobarometer, SWLS) and reports determinants, correlates, or outcomes tied to it. Studies examining how factors such as materialism, commuting time satisfaction, environmental quality, parenthood, migration, austerity, marital status, work values, economic freedom, or national events influence life satisfaction—using clear statistical links—are strongly relevant. Research focused on domain-specific satisfaction (job, family, travel) is relevant only when it explicitly connects those domains to overall life satisfaction; otherwise, it is peripheral. Works using “quality of life,” “happiness,” or “well-being” are relevant if they operationalize or report life satisfaction specifically, whereas pieces on customer/product satisfaction, life expectancy, or macro indicators without a life-satisfaction measure are non-relevant. Edge cases include brief mentions without analysis (weak relevance) and aggregate regional/country studies, which remain relevant if they analyze life satisfaction as the construct of interest.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks empirical surveys and measures of life satisfaction and quality of life, including their determinants and trends. It focuses on domains such as housing, employment, income, health, family/partnerships, social networks, politics, and the environment, with particular emphasis on West and East Germany and some international comparisons over time.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly measures or analyzes life satisfaction or closely related constructs such as subjective well-being or happiness, especially when using explicit scales or global items (e.g., “general contentment with life,” “feeling of happiness,” LSI or general satisfaction scales). Highly relevant examples include surveys that assess overall life satisfaction alongside domain satisfactions (income, housing, health, family/partnership, leisure, public safety, democracy), compare satisfaction over time or across regions (e.g., East vs. West Germany), or examine determinants like unemployment, environmental stress, and social security with life satisfaction outcomes. Non-relevant documents are those that only provide demographics or interview logistics without any life satisfaction measure, or that discuss “satisfaction” solely in unrelated contexts (e.g., job or customer satisfaction) without linking to overall life evaluation. Edge cases include studies focused on predictors (pollution, crime, rent, political attitudes) that are still relevant if they include a life satisfaction variable or analyze its change; conversely, pieces on future expectations or values are borderline unless tied back to a life satisfaction or happiness metric.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A search for "life satisfaction" seeks examples of survey questions and measurement scales used to assess overall and domain-specific satisfaction (e.g., 0–10 or 1–10 scales for life as a whole, work, housewife role, and satisfaction with democracy). The user likely wants the exact question wording and related items about which life domains matter (health, finances, housing, community, transport, culture), feelings of entitlement to satisfaction, political influence on life, and the role of lifelong learning.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "life satisfaction" when it contains an explicit question or measure asking respondents about their satisfaction with life as a whole (for example "All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole?" or a 1–10 satisfaction card such as EVS5/WVS7). Materials that record numeric or ordinal life‑satisfaction responses, or include clearly labeled scales (0–10, 1–10, or "very/fairly/not very/not at all satisfied") are directly useful. Documents that only report satisfaction for specific domains (work, health, housing, finances, community) are conditionally relevant if those domain scores are used to construct or explain overall life satisfaction, but an isolated domain item (e.g., only "work satisfaction") may be non‑relevant if the user needs a global life‑satisfaction measure. Non‑relevant items include mentions of "satisfaction" tied solely to other concepts (how democracy is working, political influence, or learning improves personal life) or files that only contain variable codes/metadata without the question text or response scale. Edge cases to watch: near‑duplicates or variant stems (entitlement-based wording like "should be entitled to" vs experienced satisfaction) affect comparability and should be treated as distinct measures unless explicitly harmonized.</narr>

	<desc>Find validated ways to define and measure life satisfaction (subjective well-being), including global and domain-specific scales like the SWLS and single-item L-1. The user likely wants brief details on items, translations, psychometric properties, and suitability for surveys and various research contexts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it defines, measures, or analyzes global life satisfaction as a construct, including its cognitive and affective components (e.g., Diener’s framework) and presents instruments or items that directly assess overall satisfaction with life. Examples of clearly relevant content include the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), the single-item General Life Satisfaction L-1, and translations/adaptations with psychometric evidence (reliability, validity, measurement invariance). Documents focused on domain-specific satisfaction (job, study, political system, neighborhood) are generally non-relevant unless they explicitly aggregate into a global life satisfaction score or examine direct links to overall life satisfaction. Edge cases include broader well-being or flourishing batteries where life satisfaction is a core subdomain (likely relevant), and instruments where life satisfaction appears only as a validation correlate (e.g., optimism SOP2 or cross-cultural loss scales), which are marginally relevant only if they report substantive associations with life satisfaction. Mentions of quality of life or life events are relevant when they directly measure or interpret life satisfaction outcomes, whereas unrelated constructs like customer satisfaction or teacher stress without a life satisfaction link are non-relevant.</narr>

<title>work</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks a synthesis of research on how work conditions and arrangements—such as stress, work environment, remote/telework, flexible hours, and atypical employment—affect employee motivation, performance, wellbeing, and work–family conflict. They also want cross-national and gender-specific insights (e.g., mothers’ working time patterns, fathers’ conflicts) and how family policies moderate these effects.</desc>
	<narr>For a broad query like “work,” the most relevant documents discuss employment or labor topics such as job conditions, working hours, remote/telework, work stress, work–family conflict, or policies and environments that shape employee performance and well-being. Empirical studies with clear measures and samples (e.g., Likert-scale surveys, SEM/PLS analyses, national panels) that examine outcomes for workers—like research on nurses’ work stress or the effects of working from home on conflict—are strong matches. Uses of “work” in other senses (e.g., coursework/homework guidelines, “social work” syllabi, or the verb “it works”) are weakly relevant unless they directly address paid work or the social work occupation as labor. Edge cases include theoretical or cross-national analyses of labor income or working-time patterns, which are relevant, versus physics “work,” “artwork,” or casual verb uses, which are not. Documents that only mention the word “work” in passing or as boilerplate without substantive discussion of labor/employment should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks comprehensive, survey-based information on working life, including actual and preferred working hours, shift/overtime practices, commute, workplace organization, compensation, and attitudes toward work. They want analyses—particularly in GDR/FRG contexts—linking these factors to satisfaction, health, performance, and labor relations (e.g., unions and works councils) across demographic groups.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “work” when it centers on employment and workplace topics such as working hours, overtime, shift and night work, job satisfaction, pay, safety, unions, commuting, and works councils. Materials that discuss attitudes to work, coordination of schedules between partners, health effects of work, performance evaluation, collective dynamics, and time-budgeting (e.g., core hours, flextime, overtime compensation) also qualify. Demographic or political details remain relevant if they are explicitly tied to work contexts—union membership, occupational qualification, readiness to change jobs, leadership style, or plan fulfillment in a work collective—but become less relevant if they stand alone without a workplace link. Non-relevant cases include “work” used in other senses (physics work, “the machine works,” “works of art”), or schoolwork/housework not tied to employment. Edge cases include documents that mostly describe leisure or family but frame them as work–life balance, or sector-specific notions like socialist “work collectives” and plan discussions; these are still relevant due to direct linkage to employment.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>User wants information about employment and job characteristics for survey or coding purposes. Specifically they need details on current/former paid work, precise occupation title, employer size and number of paid/salaried employees and supervisees, usual weekly hours, and related items (e.g., summer holiday work or father's occupation).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "work" when it explicitly concerns employment or workplace attributes — for example questions or variables about occupation, whether someone is currently working for pay, hours usually worked weekly, company size, number of paid or salaried employees, and supervisory counts. Concrete matches in this paragraph include items like "How many salaried people are working where you work," "Are you currently working for pay," and "Working hours number of hours usually worked weekly," which directly address labor and workplace measurement. Documents are not relevant when "work" appears in unrelated senses (physics/energy work, homework, or as part of another word), or when only opaque metadata or repeated codes (v1321, v418) occur with no substantive question text. Edge cases include mixed survey items such as "Did you spend your summer holiday... working" (relevant for youth or seasonal work analyses but less so for formal employment statistics) and multilingual or abbreviated forms of items that require mapping to the same employment concept. Finally, relevance depends on user intent: if the user wants every occurrence of the token "work" include broadly, but if they want employment-related documents restrict to items that clearly measure jobs, hours, company size, or pay.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking social science resources on “work,” particularly validated measurement scales (e.g., alienation, work–family conflict, vocational values, group work, employee thriving) and related datasets/tools to support research and data collection.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “work” when it focuses on employment, the workplace, or job-related constructs, such as attitudes toward work, work–family conflict, or measures of thriving at work. In this paragraph, items like “alienation from work,” “work–family conflict,” “work as a means of securing one’s livelihood,” the GRowing Work Inventory, and the evaluation of group work directly address work-related phenomena and are clearly relevant. By contrast, occurrences where “work” is used in the sense of “the works of [author],” “works for SPSS and Stata,” or “working with YouTube APIs” refer to publications, software compatibility, or technical usage and are not relevant to employment or the workplace; the YouTube Data API guide is largely irrelevant aside from incidental wording. Edge cases include constructs like “evaluation of the company” and “group work,” which remain work-relevant, whereas scales on ecological responsibility, procrastination, or sensation seeking are only tangential unless explicitly tied to workplace behavior. Overall, relevance is high for sections centered on work attitudes and experiences, and low for tool guides and general psychological scales not anchored in a work context.</narr>

<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking comprehensive, research-based information about schools, particularly in German-speaking contexts. Topics include school violence (by students and teachers), inclusion of migrant and special-needs students, student–teacher relationships, school climate and governance, family–school dynamics, student participation, and broader social and environmental roles of schools.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it primarily addresses the institution of school (Schule), such as empirical research on school violence and bullying, teacher–student relationships, inclusion of newly arrived or special-needs students, school climate and governance, or practical school initiatives (e.g., climate-neutral operations or arts education). Comparative studies of students’ and teachers’ perceptions, analyses of class- and school-level determinants of behavior, and discussions of parental roles or student participation also count as relevant because they center on schooling. By contrast, texts that use “Schule” to denote intellectual traditions (e.g., Frankfurter Schule, Chicago Schule) without discussing educational institutions, or that include the term only incidentally (in a citation, affiliation, or keyword list), are non-relevant. Edge cases include compounds like Schüler, Schulklima, Schulträger—which are relevant when the core topic is schooling—and metaphorical uses (e.g., Schule des Lebens) or unrelated senses of “school,” which are not. While the German term aligns best with German-language content, documents in other languages can still be relevant if their main focus is schools and schooling.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking research and datasets related to schools, particularly the German education system. This includes its historical development and enrollment statistics, cross-country education indicators, and contemporary surveys on student attitudes, teacher practices, digital learning, classroom management, and school resources (e.g., via HISTAT).</desc>
	<narr>For the query “schule” (German for school), a document is relevant if it primarily concerns schooling and the school system, including students, teachers, institutions, and policies. Examples include historical datasets on Höhere Schulen in the German Empire (e.g., Gymnasien, Realgymnasien, and lateinlose Anstalten in Preußen, Bayern, Württemberg), tables on enrollment and Abiturienten from HISTAT, and studies on transitions after grade 4, school inspections, VERA tests, classroom management, or digital infrastructure and learning in schools. It is non-relevant if it focuses mainly on universities or adult/vocational education without a clear school link, or uses “Schule” figuratively (e.g., Frankfurter Schule as a school of thought) or only in passing. Edge cases include mixed series that combine school and university indicators—partially relevant when school metrics are present—and documents centered on “Schüler” or “Lehrer” without the word “Schule,” which can still be relevant due to direct topical overlap.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants an overview of survey questions and public opinions about schools in Germany. Specifically they are seeking information on current attendance (self or children), school type and completion, views on student violence and grade retention, teaching of economic topics, and COVID-related issues like school closures and remote learning.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "schule" when it directly discusses schools or schooling—explicit occurrences of "Schule" or "Schulen", questions about attending school, types of schools (e.g., Grundschule, Hochschule), school policy, or events affecting schools (like closures). For example, the paragraph contains many clear relevance signals: repeated survey items such as "Besuchen Sie gegenwärtig eine Schule...", questions about children attending school, references to "Schulbildung" and the Corona-related school closures. Edge cases that should still count as relevant include morphological and compound forms (Schulen, Schulbildung, Hochschulen), while false positives arise when the string appears inside a proper name, surname, or an unrelated idiom. Documents that merely mention "Schule" once in passing, are in another language without translation, or are low-quality duplicates/metadata (repeated survey codes or verbatim prompts) may be technically relevant but less useful depending on the user’s intent (for example, someone seeking information about primary schools might find university references irrelevant).</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking an overview of validated measurement instruments and survey standards used in German school and education research—covering teacher-related constructs (job satisfaction, perceived suitability, stress), classroom climate, bullying self-efficacy, digital learning readiness, and growth mindset, as well as sociodemographic items including for migrants. They also want references to major studies and pretests (e.g., PIAAC, COVID-19-related child future anxiety scales) and evidence of psychometric quality.</desc>
	<narr>The German keyword “schule” targets content about schools, pupils, teachers, classrooms, and educational credentials, so documents describing classroom climate, teacher-student interactions, bullying among pupils, or measures of school attainment (e.g., Schulabschluss) are relevant. This paragraph is highly relevant because it discusses teachers’ self-efficacy regarding bullying, classroom climate dimensions, primary school interventions, and survey items capturing school and training degrees, as well as digital readiness for teaching and learning in schools. A document would be non-relevant if “Schule” appears only as a substring in unrelated contexts (e.g., Frankfurter Schule as a philosophical school, Fahrschule/driving school, a surname) or solely within “Hochschule” when the intent is K‑12 schooling. Edge cases include higher-education contexts like Hochschule or teacher training that still refer to school classrooms—these may be partially relevant—and survey methodology pieces that mainly treat demographics but contain substantive sections on school qualifications. Matching should consider capitalization and variants such as Schule, Schulen, schul-, Schüler, Schulabschluss, and Grundschule.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks research-based information on drugs, emphasizing policy, pricing, prescribing, prevention, and enforcement across countries. They want to understand how patents, decriminalization/harm reduction, media campaigns, and healthcare practices affect drug prices, use patterns, health outcomes, and crime.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantially discusses drugs as substances—medical or illicit—including their pricing, prescribing, use/abuse, treatment, regulation, or social and policy impacts; synonyms like medicines, pharmaceuticals, narcotics, and controlled substances also signal relevance. Examples include studies of HIV/AIDS drug prices in developing countries, analyses of national drug policies and harm reduction, research on GPs modifying hospital-prescribed medications, evaluations of anti-drug media campaigns, and case studies of addiction or drug-related crime. It remains relevant in technical contexts such as drug discovery, delivery systems, or decriminalization and treatment program evaluations, and in areas like sports doping or antibiotic/drug resistance where drugs are central to the topic. A document is non-relevant when “drug(s)” appears only tangentially (e.g., a company name, a passing metaphor, or general healthcare administration with no drug-focused content) or when the focus is retail logistics of “drug stores” without discussing the drugs themselves. Edge cases include pieces where “drug” is used as a verb in crime reports (often still relevant), articles centered on broader public health with only incidental drug mentions (weakly relevant), or policy texts where drugs are one of many minor examples (borderline).</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking comprehensive, survey-based information on drug use and attitudes—covering alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs—especially among youth, including prevalence, motives, risk perceptions, accessibility, and personal/network exposure. They want datasets/questionnaires (e.g., Germany and EU Eurobarometer/BZgA) with measures of policy and prevention attitudes, sanctions, and institutional roles, along with detailed demographics and social-context variables.</desc>
	<narr>Highly relevant documents for the query “drugs” explicitly discuss illicit or psychoactive substance use, attitudes, availability, risks, prevention, policy, or enforcement—like surveys on youth consumption of cannabis, ecstasy, cocaine, heroin, perceptions of health danger and dependence, motives for use, access within 24 hours, legalization, drug testing, and effectiveness of anti-drug campaigns. Content that ties drugs to related public health issues (e.g., AIDS transmission, harm reduction), gateway substances (alcohol and nicotine), and comparative assessments across places or demographics also fits well, especially when it includes measures, settings (schools, parties, clubs), and social networks. Examples here include questions on personal drug offers, places to obtain drugs, preferred sentences for drug crimes, therapy vs. punishment, and knowledge of legal consequences—all squarely on-topic. Documents would be non-relevant if “drug” appears only tangentially (e.g., general health, housework, or job stress without a drug component) or refers solely to unrelated uses of the word (pharmaceutical stock markets, “drug” as the past tense of drag). Edge cases include pieces focused solely on alcohol/tobacco or medications used as prescribed; they may be borderline unless framed as entry drugs, abuse, or part of a broader intoxicant/drug problem.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>Someone looking for this wants survey-style information about people’s experiences with and perceptions of drug problems in their area — how often they encounter drug use or related paraphernalia, whether they personally know addicts, and whether drugs are seen as a workplace issue. They also want attitudes about availability and danger of specific drugs (e.g., ecstasy, heroin, cannabis) and whether drug addiction is viewed mainly as a social, health, economic, criminal, or moral problem.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "drugs" when it directly discusses drug-related topics such as substance types (e.g., heroin, ecstasy, cannabis), patterns of use, availability, public contact with drug problems, addiction impacts (health, social, economic, moral, criminal), workplace concerns, or survey questions and statistics about these issues. For example, a questionnaire that asks how often people saw drug dealing, how easy it is to get particular drugs, or whether drug addiction is seen as an important workplace problem (like the provided paragraph) is clearly highly relevant. A document is non-relevant if it only mentions "drugs" in passing, uses the word metaphorically, or deals solely with unrelated pharmaceutical technicalities (e.g., dosing guidelines for prescribed medications) without addressing substance use or policy. Edge cases include medical documents about prescription drugs that may be relevant if they cover misuse or diversion, and lists of drug names with no context (low relevance) or duplicate/templated survey items (relevant but lower informational value); assessing depth and focus (detailed analysis vs. single mentions) helps determine final relevance.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking information on how drug offenses are defined and measured within the adolescent self-reported delinquency scale, specifically how they are represented among the 16 items assessing dissocial behavior.</desc>
	<narr>For the query "drugs," a document is relevant if it discusses drugs in any substantive way—illicit substances, medications, drug use/abuse, policy, trafficking, testing, or drug-related crimes. This paragraph is relevant because it explicitly mentions “drug offences” as part of an adolescent delinquency scale, though drugs are a secondary facet among broader crime categories, making the relevance partial. Documents that focus on drug use, specific substances, health effects, treatment, prevention, or legal frameworks around drugs would be more strongly relevant, whereas content limited to theft, property damage, or violent crimes without any drug reference would be non-relevant. An edge case is lexical variation: the query “drugs” might not exactly match “drug offences” without stemming, yet the topic is still aligned; by contrast, incidental mentions (e.g., in a bibliography) or purely metaphorical uses would not be relevant. Another nuance is intent—both medical and criminal-justice contexts can satisfy “drugs,” but if the user seeks pharmacological information specifically, a delinquency scale mentioning drug offences would be only tangentially useful.</narr>

	<desc>Find research and statistics on shift work, focusing on its health and social consequences (e.g., work–life balance and psychosomatic complaints), who is affected, and which organizational or policy measures can mitigate negative effects, particularly in the German/EU context.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it primarily examines Schichtarbeit (shift work) itself—its schedules (e.g., two-shift, multi-shift), prevalence in sectors, and especially its impacts on health, work-life balance, and social life. Strong signals include empirical analyses (e.g., mediation analyses linking shift work to psychosomatic complaints), sectoral or regional studies (production plants, police), and references to recognized data sources like the BIBB/BAuA Erwerbstätigenbefragung, EU ad hoc labour modules, or the Mikrozensus, as well as related terms such as Schichtdienst or Mehrschichtarbeit. Documents discussing organizational or legal frameworks for shift work, mitigation measures, or team dynamics/solidarity under shift regimes are also relevant. Non-relevant items are those that mention “Schichtarbeit” only in passing (e.g., as one item in a long list of labor conditions or legal topics) or use “shift” in an unrelated sense (a shift in policy), without substantive analysis of shift work. Edge cases include historical DDR youth studies or male-dominated industry articles: they are relevant if shift work is a core focus, while texts about flexible hours or night work alone are borderline unless clearly embedded in a shift system.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks survey-based information on shift work—its schedules, prevalence, and conditions—and how it influences TV/radio consumption, daily time use, health, family life, and satisfaction. It also calls for demographic breakdowns and related workplace factors (e.g., overtime, weekend work, partner’s schedule).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses shift work (Schichtarbeit) structures and timing, such as two-, three-, or four-shift rotations, late-shift end times, night-shift routines, and the frequency or necessity of shift schedules. It is especially relevant when it analyzes the effects of shift work on workers’ lives and jobs—health complaints, family and childcare, sleep, leisure, and media habits (for example, TV preferences after a late shift or radio listening by shift status), including the partner’s shift schedule. Surveys that include “Schichtarbeit” as a demographic field can be relevant if they stratify or compare outcomes by shift status or explore time budgets and weekend work in relation to shifts; a mere checkbox without analysis is only weakly relevant. Documents focused solely on audience ratings, program evaluations, or general demographics with no link to shift schedules are non-relevant. Edge cases like studies of on-call duty, Saturday/Sunday work, or flexible hours are relevant when they clearly imply rotating or nonstandard work hours akin to shift work.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A survey question asking whether the respondent worked shift work between February and April, which specific shift types they worked (early/Frühschicht, late/Spätschicht, night/Nachtschicht, day/Tagschicht, or other/split shifts), and the reasons why they work in shift schedules. The goal is to record shift participation and motivations for working shifts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses "Schichtarbeit" (shift work) or the specific survey items and codes shown — for example EF158, EF105–EF112 — and lists the shift types (Frühschicht, Spätschicht, Nachtschicht, Tagschicht, Sonstige) or asks for reasons for working shifts or whether the respondent worked in the Feb–Apr period. It is non-relevant when it does not mention shift work or those codes, only treats unrelated employment topics, uses a different time window, or only uses the English phrase "shift work" without connection to the same survey structure. Partial matches (edge cases) include documents that mention one or two shift types but not the survey questions, templates that contain the question IDs but no substantive content, or translations where terminology differs (e.g., "split shifts" vs. "geteilte Arbeitszeit") — these may be partially relevant depending on whether you need exact codes or just conceptual matches. Finally, documents that contain respondent answers to those exact questions (e.g., selected shifts or stated reasons) are highly relevant, whereas statistical summaries or commentary about shift work that do not map back to the listed items are less relevant.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user wants information about "schichtarbeit" (shift work): what it is and the different types of shift systems. They likely need details on legal regulations and workers' rights, effects on health and sleep, and practical scheduling or coping strategies for employers and employees.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "schichtarbeit" if it directly discusses shift work topics such as types of shifts (night shifts, rotating/Wechselschicht), scheduling and rostering (Schichtplan), legal and collective-bargaining rules for shift schedules, or health and safety impacts like circadian disruption and fatigue. Useful examples include academic studies on the health effects of night work, employer policies or templates for shift rosters, guidance for nurses and factory workers on shift handovers, or software descriptions for shift planning. Documents are non-relevant when the term is absent or used metaphorically (e.g., "Schicht" meaning a geological layer or a painting layer), when job ads merely mention hours without specifying shift patterns, or when the mention of shift work is a passing aside with no substantive content. Edge cases include regional or legal variations (country-specific labor law references are relevant but only to that jurisdiction), documents using synonyms or misspellings (Nachtschicht, Schichtdienst, Wechselschicht), bilingual texts where "schichtarbeit" appears only in a caption, and scans/images with the word present but no searchable text—these can be borderline and require closer inspection for true relevance.</narr>

They also want evidence on consequences for health, life expectancy, families and marriages, youth outcomes, and the effectiveness of labor market policies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “arbeitslosigkeit” when it primarily analyzes, describes, measures, or theorizes unemployment (including synonyms like Erwerbslosigkeit) such as rates, duration, determinants, subgroup patterns (youth, long-term, qualification-specific), or policy responses. Examples of clearly relevant content include studies of unemployment flows and transitions, effects on health and life expectancy, impacts on families and marital stability, evaluations of labor-market measures affecting exits from unemployment, or discussions of benefit receipt (Arbeitslosengeld, Grundsicherung) tied to unemployed populations. Adjacent topics are still relevant if they explicitly link to unemployment—for instance, research on sickness and unemployment credits in pension data, the role of macroeconomic cycles in unemployment risk, or transitions between unemployment, education, inactivity, and self-employment. Non-relevant documents are those that only mention the term in passing, focus on different concepts (e.g., Arbeitsunfähigkeit/sickness absence or general employment) without an unemployment angle, or use “unemployment” metaphorically without empirical or conceptual treatment. Edge cases include underemployment, early retirement, or regional labor dynamics—these are relevant when framed as causes, consequences, or flows to/from unemployment, but marginal if the unemployment component is incidental or unquantified.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks comprehensive information on unemployment—its trends, determinants, and policy responses—with a focus on Europe (especially Germany), including cross-country comparisons since the 1970s and macroeconomic frameworks like Okun’s law and hysteresis. They also want relevant datasets and survey evidence and analyses of social impacts across periods such as the Weimar era and post-reunification East Germany.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “arbeitslosigkeit” if it directly analyzes unemployment—its trends, levels, causes, or remedies—such as studies of rising EU joblessness since 1974, cross-country comparisons (Germany, France, UK, Italy), or macro models like Okun’s law and the hysteresis hypothesis that explain persistence. Empirical resources centered on unemployment (e.g., time series tables of EU/US/Japan jobless rates, variable-parameter regressions for Germany 1960–1990, or longitudinal surveys of East German unemployed and their partners) are also clearly relevant. Macro discussions that link unemployment with inflation and growth, or evaluate labor-market institutions and policy responses, count as relevant when unemployment is a principal outcome. By contrast, documents are weakly relevant or non-relevant if “Arbeitslosigkeit” appears only as a minor survey item among many neighborhood or political topics, or if the focus is mainly on other issues (e.g., inflation) with little substantive treatment of unemployment. Edge cases include historical analyses (e.g., Weimar-era unemployment) and methodological overviews or tables of contents that still provide unemployment measures or frameworks—those are relevant—whereas materials on employment or training that never connect to unemployment rates, or metaphorical uses of the term, are not.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for public-opinion survey content about unemployment in Germany (Arbeitslosigkeit), including general attitudes, who is to blame (especially for East German unemployment), which actors can best reduce it (state, unions, employers), reactions to policy changes (e.g., introduction of the Euro) and specific measures (like cutting overtime), and how people would feel if personally unemployed.</desc>
	<narr>This document is highly relevant to the query "arbeitslosigkeit" because it repeatedly mentions Arbeitslosigkeit and contains many questions and prompts about causes, who is to blame, policy measures (e.g., reducing overtime), regional issues (East Germany), and effects such as feelings during unemployment. It appears to be a survey instrument or questionnaire (note the variable codes like V204, repeated question stems), so it is especially useful if you are looking for public-opinion question wording, survey design, or raw question content about unemployment. It is less relevant if you are searching for analytical content, up-to-date statistics, empirical results, or policy evaluations, since the paragraph contains no numeric outcomes, dates, or interpretive discussion and is highly repetitive. Edge cases: the text is ideal for tasks like translation, coding question-response mappings, or building a corpus of unemployment-related survey items, but not for answering factual questions such as current unemployment rates or evidence-based policy effectiveness. Also note the document is in German with many abbreviations and duplicated lines, which may require deduplication or language-specific processing depending on your use case.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks information about unemployment, particularly in the context of consumer ethnocentrism and the belief that buying foreign products harms the domestic economy and leads to job losses.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “arbeitslosigkeit” if it directly addresses unemployment—its definition, causes, consequences, rates (e.g., Arbeitslosenquote), policies, or related supports like benefits and insurance—and if it uses the term or close variants such as Erwerbslosigkeit, Langzeitarbeitslosigkeit, Jugendarbeitslosigkeit, or Jobverlust. Content that links other topics to unemployment, for example arguing that certain consumer behaviors can “cause unemployment,” can also be relevant, though it may be only marginally so if unemployment is mentioned in passing while the main focus (e.g., a psychometric scale for consumer ethnocentrism) lies elsewhere. Strong signals include statistics, labor market analysis, discussions of the Bundesagentur für Arbeit data, or policy debates about reducing unemployment. Non-relevant items are those that discuss ethnocentrism or consumption without any tie to unemployment, use “arbeitslosigkeit” metaphorically, or focus solely on unrelated labor concepts; pieces about Arbeitslosengeld or Arbeitslosenversicherung are relevant only if they connect back to the state or dynamics of unemployment. Edge cases include documents where unemployment appears in a single section of a broader topic, German compound forms that embed the term, case variations, or multilingual texts where the German term is briefly cited but the substantive discussion occurs under another language’s term for unemployment.</narr>

<title>antisemitismus</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks a scholarly overview of antisemitism—its definitions, theories, and typologies across history and today (e.g., anti-Judaism, racial, secondary/Israel-related, Islamist; left- and right-wing forms). They are especially interested in debates about a “new antisemitism,” how to distinguish legitimate criticism of Israel from antisemitism, and empirical trends and case studies in Europe (notably Germany and Austria).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively defines, analyzes, or documents antisemitism—its concepts, theories, historical forms, and contemporary variants (e.g., traditional, secondary, left-wing, islamist, or Israel-related antisemitism), including empirical surveys or case studies. Texts that probe the boundary between legitimate criticism of Israeli government policy, anti-Zionism, and antisemitism, or that debate “old vs. new antisemitism,” count as relevant even when they use related terms like Israel-feindlichkeit and focus on methods such as hermeneutic or sequence analysis. Region- or milieu-specific investigations (Austria, Germany, France, Iran), discussions of Catholic or political antisemitism, and EU/OSCE policy debates are also relevant if they tie clearly to antisemitic semantics, attitudes, or structures. By contrast, documents that only mention the word in passing, treat prejudice in general without linking it to antisemitism, or use “Semitic” solely in linguistic/anthropological contexts are non-relevant. Edge cases include Holocaust or Middle East coverage and polemics: these are relevant only when they explicitly conceptualize or measure antisemitism (e.g., transferring classic stereotypes to Israel, “everyday” or “democratic” antisemitism) rather than merely narrating events or policy disputes.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks comparable survey data and analyses on antisemitism, including prevalence, forms (hate crime, hate speech, discrimination), attitudes toward Jews, and personal experiences, along with legal awareness and reporting behavior. The focus is on EU- and Germany-based studies and trends over time with demographic detail.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “antisemitismus” when it explicitly examines antisemitism as attitudes, experiences, incidents, or policy/legal responses—such as surveys of Jewish people’s exposure to harassment, hate crime, discrimination, or perceptions of safety and media/internet hostility. For example, reports of the FRA’s 2018 EU survey of 16,395 Jewish respondents, question modules on antisemitic comments, vandalism, legal awareness, and trends over time, or datasets like Eurobarometer, ALLBUS, GLES, and Thüringen Monitor that include classic, secondary, and Israel‑related antisemitism scales are clearly relevant. Documents that only list “antisemitism” alongside many topics (e.g., racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia) are still relevant if they specify measures, items, or results on antisemitism; they are non‑relevant if the term appears merely in passing without any content, data, or findings. Materials focused solely on unrelated modules (e.g., housing conditions or biodiversity) are non‑relevant unless they contain a dedicated antisemitism section. Edge cases include methodology‑only descriptions (sampling, weighting) that are relevant if they pertain to an antisemitism module, and texts about Israel/Palestine that are relevant when operationalized as antisemitism items (e.g., NS comparisons, boycotts), but not when discussing geopolitics without an antisemitism frame.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A user searching "antisemitismus" wants a concise explanation of antisemitism — what it is, how it shows up in society, and recent debates or incidents in Germany (e.g., the "Antisemitismusstreit"). They may also want to know how antisemitism is perceived as a public problem, as reflected in opinion‑survey coding and responses.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "antisemitismus" if it explicitly addresses antisemitism — for example reporting antisemitic incidents, analyzing the “Antisemitismusstreit,” discussing public attitudes or policies toward antisemitism, or if it is a survey result where respondents list antisemitism (code 15) as an important problem. Documents that only mention unrelated items from the long topic list (e.g., unemployment, Euro, Iraq) or that simply include the word “Antisemitismus” as a bare list entry without substantive content should be considered low relevance. Edge cases include pieces about the Israel–Palestine conflict or right‑wing extremism (NPD): these can be highly relevant if they examine antisemitic rhetoric or actions, but not if they treat geopolitics or general extremism without linking to antisemitism. Also watch for synonyms, spelling variants (anti‑Semitism, antisemitic) and brief passing mentions in aggregated codebooks — such matches may be false positives unless the context actually discusses antisemitism.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking information on how antisemitism is measured in German social surveys, specifically the development and cognitive pretesting of antisemitism-related questionnaire items in the FGZ Cohesion Panel (wave 2) and ALLBUS 2006.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “antisemitismus” if it substantively addresses antisemitism—e.g., defines the concept, reports attitudes or incidents, presents survey items or scales about antisemitism, or describes methods for testing such questions. The provided paragraph is relevant because it details pretests and cognitive evaluation of survey questions on antisemitism in the FGZ cohesion panel and the ALLBUS 2006 study, including methodologies like web probing and cognitive interviews. A document would be non-relevant if it only mentions antisemitism in passing within a topic list (e.g., alongside climate change or gender equality) but provides no further information, results, or instrumentation related to antisemitism. Edge cases that should still count as relevant include methodology-only papers validating antisemitism items, datasets whose variables cover antisemitism, or German/English variants of the term (“Antisemitismus”/“antisemitism”). Borderline cases include general prejudice studies that list a single antisemitism indicator without detail, or historical discussions of anti-Judaism that never engage the modern antisemitism construct.</narr>

<title>health</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an evidence-based overview of health from a population and policy perspective, including health care system organization and financing, public health law, and the role of health and digital health literacy. They also want to understand how reforms and economic development influence access to care, health behaviors, and disparities in health outcomes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “health” when it primarily examines human health, health care systems, public health policy, health literacy, or health behaviors and outcomes, such as studies of digital health literacy in Germany, analyses of Croatian health care reform, or evaluations of how privatization affects unmet health needs. Empirical work that measures health status (subjective or objective), investigates determinants of health (education, age, socioeconomic status), or explores health promotion and information seeking (e.g., internet health information and physician visits) is also clearly relevant. Legal, economic, or sociological analyses are relevant if they explicitly link their frameworks to population health, service provision, or health inequalities (for example, public health law foundations or the SARS-driven critique of China’s health system). By contrast, documents that use “health” only metaphorically (economic “health”), as a passing mention, or in non-human contexts (veterinary health), or that focus solely on survey methodology without a health application, would be non-relevant. Edge cases include broad policy or consumer behavior pieces: they count as relevant when health is the central domain (e.g., sexual health program concepts or health information seeking profiles), but not when health is incidental to a different primary topic.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks comprehensive survey and time-series data on health-related topics—health education, personal behaviors, occupational safety/psychosocial risks, and the organization and financing of health care—primarily in Germany and Europe. They need sources, indicators, and methodologies (e.g., ISSP, ESENER, HISTAT) for cross-time and cross-national analysis to support research or policy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “health” when it substantively addresses human health, health behaviors, health education, healthcare systems/financing, public health metrics, or occupational safety and health. Examples that clearly qualify include surveys of children’s health education, descriptions of Germany’s statutory health insurance and expenditure accounts, ISSP modules on health and healthcare, OSH surveys on psychosocial risks, and studies of nutrition, smoking, exercise, and preventive checkups. Materials that are heavy on methodology, demographics, or codes can still be relevant if they measure or inform health outcomes, services, or policy; by contrast, texts that only mention “health” in passing (e.g., in an institution’s name) without substantive health content are not relevant. Edge cases such as historical insurance statistics, workplace risk management, and food risk assessments are relevant because they concern determinants or measurement of human health, whereas uses of “health” to describe business or system performance, or incidental mentions in unrelated topics, are non-relevant. Variants and related terms (e.g., health care, healthful lifestyle, OSH, GKV/RVO) and even misspellings count toward relevance, but documents that are just variable lists without health context or that focus on non-human health (plants/animals) would not.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>A survey-style information need asking whether respondents received health education and from which sources (family, youth organizations, school, radio/TV/papers, or don't know). It also asks if respondents’ work affects their health and, if so, how — listing specific effects like fatigue, stress, headaches, sleep problems, skin issues, heart disease, anxiety, irritability, stomachache, etc.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant when it explicitly contains the survey questions or responses about health education sources (for example “Was this health education within family,” “at school,” “via radio/TV/papers,” or “youth organisation”) or the Q34 items asking whether and how work affects health (e.g., “stress,” “headaches,” “sleep problems,” “heart disease,” “improves health,” or “does not affect”). Relevant examples include a survey row showing v1265 = “Yes, at school” or Q34 = “Headaches” as an answer; these give clear mappings between code labels and meaningful content. Non‑relevant documents are those that only contain unrelated material, purely financial/operational text, or noisy repeated metadata without readable questions or responses (for instance a page of only codes like v1262,v1263 with no human‑readable labels). Edge cases include partial matches (mentions of “health education” but about curriculum policy rather than individual receipt), documents with only DK/“don’t know” entries or untranslated labels (ambiguous but potentially useful for mapping), and verbose duplicates where meaning is present but obscured by repetition.</narr>

They need guidance on web tracking and social media recruitment, validated health and well-being scales (e.g., SF-12, self-efficacy, flourishing, workaholism), and ethical and cross-language considerations for vulnerable populations.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “health” when it directly discusses physical or mental health outcomes, measurement instruments, analytics, health-related populations, or healthcare practice and ethics. In this passage, content on digital behavioral data for health analytics, the SF-12 physical/mental health survey, occupational health psychology (e.g., workaholism impacts), and the Human Flourishing Scale’s health domains are clearly relevant, as are interviews on digital epidemiology and studying vulnerable communities online. Method guides (web tracking, recruiting via Facebook/Instagram) are relevant when they are applied to health topics such as health information seeking or sampling health workers; if they describe methods without a health use case, they are only tangentially relevant. Edge cases include general variables like age or self-efficacy, which are relevant when explicitly linked to health analyses but not when presented in isolation or in non-health contexts; likewise, uses of “health” as a metaphor (e.g., “system health”) would be non-relevant. Overall, this paragraph is strongly relevant because it repeatedly centers on health measurement, mental health, and ethical issues in health data.</narr>

<title>safety</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The query seeks scholarly overviews of safety across multiple domains—traffic, schools, healthcare, energy, finance, and media—focusing on safety culture, policy and regulation, leadership, training, and public perceptions, including cross-national comparisons and their impact on outcomes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly examines safety as the prevention of harm or risk management in a concrete domain—such as road traffic safety, school safety, patient safety in healthcare, offshore petroleum safety, or journalist safety—including case studies of accidents, regulatory approaches, safety technologies, training, or safety culture and perceptions. Studies that operationalize safety as a construct (for example, psychological safety in workplaces or neighborhood safety for older adults) are also relevant when they analyze determinants, measurement, and interventions that affect safety outcomes. By contrast, pieces where “safety” refers primarily to economic or policy metaphors like the global financial safety net or debates on the social safety net are weakly relevant unless the user’s intent explicitly targets those policy frameworks. Edge cases include work where safety is a secondary pathway (e.g., leadership influencing innovation via psychological safety) or where “safety” appears only in passing or in instrument names without substantive discussion—these are marginal. Documents that merely mention “safe” rhetorically without analyzing risks, standards, or protective measures should be considered non-relevant.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>Find survey-based information on how organizations manage safety—especially occupational safety and health—covering risk assessments, psychosocial risks, training, regulatory compliance, supervisory oversight, and employee participation. Emphasis is on European and German studies (e.g., ESENER, company/employee surveys, Eurobarometers) and related topics like product and consumer safety.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it treats safety as a central theme—such as occupational safety and health (risk assessments, training, regulatory compliance, accident/illness rates), consumer and product safety (testing, labeling, recalls), or public safety domains like road or flight safety—and describes concrete measures, policies, practices, or perceptions. Empirical materials (e.g., surveys of enterprises about OSH, supervision by authorities, prevention culture, psychosocial risk management) are highly relevant because they show how safety is organized, implemented, and evaluated. A document is non-relevant when “safety” appears only incidentally, as a brand name or metaphor, or in unrelated contexts (e.g., financial safety nets, inventory safety stock, or cybersecurity without a clear link to physical/occupational/product safety). Edge cases include broad workplace well-being texts that mention safety alongside health: they are relevant only if they detail safety procedures, roles, or outcomes rather than listing safety as a buzzword. Historical or region-specific surveys also qualify when they describe concrete safety frameworks or outcomes, even if they use variant terms like H&S, OSH, GDA, or ESENER.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>A request for summary data on public attitudes, experiences and behaviours related to product and workplace safety—specifically whether EU actions have affected consumer safety, exposure to and sources of safety instructions for domestic electrical appliances, preferences for how safety information is delivered, clarity and comprehensibility of written instructions, perceived benefits of health and safety at work, belief in safety symbols, and self-reported compliance with safety guidance. The user wants concise information about how people see, understand, receive and act on safety information and warnings.</desc>
	<narr>A relevant document will directly address consumer and product safety topics covered in the query — for example EU regulatory actions to improve product safety, domestic electrical hazards (risk from liquids, ventilation, rain/moisture, power sources, repairs) and whether people have seen specific safety instructions, logos or symbols. It should also cover how people prefer to receive safety information (leaflets, labels, online), their comprehension of text instructions (too technical, hard to read, plain language, to the point), and self-reported compliance. Non-relevant documents merely using the word “safety” in passing, discussing unrelated domains (e.g., IT/software safety, purely financial risk), or product reviews that omit safety guidance would not match. Edge cases include workplace health-and-safety reports that partially overlap (relevant if they discuss benefits or perceptions), highly technical standards that are about compliance but not user-facing instructions (partially relevant), and multilingual or survey-metadata files that mention these items but do not report respondents’ perceptions (low relevance).</narr>

They want validated survey instruments (e.g., PsySafety Check, HPTS), their versions, and evidence of reliability, validity, and links to outcomes like team performance and quality of life.</desc>
	<narr>Highly relevant documents will focus on psychological safety in teams—e.g., studies validating instruments like the PsySafety Check (PS C) or the High Performance Team Survey (HPTS), reporting psychometric evidence (convergent/divergent validity, criterion validity) and links to outcomes such as team learning, belonging, and performance, including references like Google’s Project Aristotle. Papers that treat “safety” as part of quality-of-life assessments (for example, neighborhood traffic safety or child-friendliness) can be partially relevant if safety is analyzed as a core dimension, but are secondary to team-based psychological safety. Non-relevant items include content on unrelated domains such as product or food safety, cybersecurity, occupational accident protocols, or sports uses of “safety,” which do not address interpersonal risk-taking or team climate. Edge cases include documents that list safety as one among many factors without analysis or measurement detail (marginal relevance) or essays on “safe spaces” without empirical constructs or validated scales (less relevant unless tied to measurement and outcomes).</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks scholarly, interdisciplinary resources on sexuality conceptualized as a sociocultural and historical construct rather than a purely biological drive. They want coverage of gender and power (heteronormativity, feminist and queer theory), relationships and measurement, childhood development and education, media and pornography, prostitution, and sexualized violence, including implications for policy and professional practice.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant when it engages substantively with Sexualität—its meanings, practices, measurement, regulation, or cultural representation—rather than merely mentioning the word. Clear examples include analyses of sexuality as a sociocultural category, validated measures of physical/affective attraction in partnerships, discussions of child and adolescent sexual development and education, or feminist/queer debates on heteronormativity, pornography, and sexualized violence. Works in media, religion, law, counseling, or social work are relevant if they examine how sexuality is constructed, negotiated, or governed within those domains. Non-relevant items are those where Sexualität appears only in passing (e.g., in a contents list or metadata) or where the focus is purely anatomical reproduction without linkage to human sexual behavior, identity, or meanings. Edge cases include compound terms (e.g., Heterosexualität, Sexualerziehung, sexualisierte Gewalt) or synonyms like “sex,” which are relevant if sexuality is central; content about minors is in-scope when developmental/educational, whereas explicit or merely sensational material would not align with the likely intent.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking social research datasets and surveys on sexuality in Germany, including attitudes, behaviors, education, contraception, and HIV/AIDS across populations such as adolescents, students, and prisoners. They want studies with methodological details and demographics that explore relationships, sexual health knowledge, and protection practices.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it centrally discusses human sexuality (Sexualität) or closely related constructs, such as sexual behavior, attitudes, education, contraception, HIV/AIDS, consent, or sexualized peer violence—e.g., surveys of adolescents and students on first intercourse, masturbation, contraceptive use, sexual orientation, or evaluations of sex education and protection concepts. Materials like study descriptions, questionnaires, data dictionaries, or reports from BZgA/BMBF projects that enumerate variables on “Liebe und Sexualität,” sexual morals, partner dynamics, or AIDS knowledge are strongly relevant, even when presented as topic lists. Documents are only weakly or non-relevant if “Sexualität” appears in passing within a broader health or lifestyle inventory (for instance, listed once among many life domains without substantive analysis), or if it is used metaphorically or solely in citations. German-language content and morphological variants (Sexualverhalten, sexuell, sexualisierte Gewalt) increase relevance; so do population-specific studies (e.g., youth, students, prisoners) that measure sexual practices, norms, and protection behaviors. Edge cases include duplicates of the same survey description, items about film reception tied to youth love/sexuality (relevant if they analyze sexual themes), or biology-focused texts on animal reproduction without the human-social context (likely non-relevant to this query).</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>The user wants to know how the disclosure of Thomas Hitzlsperger’s homosexuality relates to active professional footballers, specifically asking about public and professional acceptance — would an active pro who is openly gay be supported, hired, or face discrimination.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "sexualität" when it directly addresses sexual orientation, coming-out experiences, public discussions of sexuality (especially in sports), or policies and social attitudes toward LGBTQ+ athletes. For example, a news article about Thomas Hitzlsperger coming out, interviews with active professional footballers about being gay, club anti-discrimination policies, or surveys of fan reactions would be clearly relevant. Documents that focus narrowly on biological reproduction, clinical sexual health without linking to orientation, erotica, or unrelated uses of the word are not relevant. Borderline cases include historical treatments of sexuality in sport, language-other-than-German sources, and speculative gossip that attempts to out an active player — these may touch the topic but raise privacy and reliability concerns. Prefer authoritative, respectful sources that discuss acceptance, policy, or concrete examples of active athletes coming out; avoid materials that invade privacy or rely on rumors.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively discusses sexuality—such as sexual education, sexual health, contraception, relationships, or pregnancy—and uses terms like Sexualität, Verhütung, Partnerschaft, or Schwangerschaft with explanatory content. Materials that present tools or assessments (e.g., a questionnaire measuring knowledge about sexuality and contraceptive methods) are strongly relevant because they directly address understanding of sexuality. Documents are less relevant if they only mention the word “Sexualität” in passing, in navigation menus, tag lists, or bibliographies without meaningful discussion. Edge cases include texts about animal reproduction or legal discussions of sexual offenses, which match the keyword but may miss a user’s likely intent for human sexual health or education; they can be considered weakly relevant. Language alignment also matters: German-language content matching the query term “Sexualität” is more likely to be relevant than unrelated content in other languages or about gender (“Geschlecht”) without sexual context.</narr>

They also want evidence on the prevalence, dynamics, and impacts of sexual harassment and violence in workplaces and higher education, and implications for policy and sexuality education.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if the term “sexual” is central to its topic, such as studies on sexual health and pleasure (e.g., GeSiD findings linking sexual pleasure to STI communication and condom use), sexual satisfaction across orientations and ages (e.g., DEAS results), or analyses of sexual harassment and violence in workplaces and universities. It is also relevant when “sexual” anchors theoretical or policy discussions, like the history and definitions of sexual health in public health or feminist critiques of sexualized power in organizations. Documents are less relevant if “sexual” appears only tangentially (e.g., a single passing mention, only in a citation or title in the references) or if the core focus is general health or organizational issues without substantive sexual content. Edge cases include language and morphology: non-English variants (e.g., German “sexuelle/sexualisierte”) and related forms (“sexuality,” “sexualized”) may or may not match the exact keyword depending on indexing, while compounds like “homosexual” or “asexual” might be missed by strict token matching. Another edge case is domain drift, where “sexual” in biological contexts (e.g., sexual dimorphism in animals) technically matches but is off-topic if the user intends human sexuality.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks comprehensive survey data on sexual behavior and partner relations—covering attitudes to love/sexuality, first intercourse, contraception and condom use, practices and frequency, orgasms, orientation, cohabitation, partner violence, and HIV/AIDS knowledge and communication—across groups such as youth, students, workers, prisoners, and homosexuals, with relevant demographic and social context.</desc>
	<narr>For the query “sexual,” a document is relevant when it directly addresses sexuality or sexual behavior, using terms like sexual intercourse, masturbation, sexual orientation, contraception, AIDS/HIV risk, or partner relations. The provided text is highly relevant because it enumerates survey topics on first intercourse, contraceptive use, orgasms, masturbation, orientations (heterosexual/homosexual/bisexual), sexual practices, and AIDS knowledge across multiple populations (youth, students, workers, prisoners). By contrast, documents where “sexual” appears only incidentally or in unrelated contexts—such as sexual reproduction in plants, sexual dimorphism in animals, or “sex” used solely as a demographic field—would be weakly relevant or non-relevant. Edge cases include content that avoids the exact word “sexual” but clearly discusses sexual conduct via synonyms like intimacy, cohabitation, or partner practices, which should still be treated as relevant. Another edge case is policy or violence-focused texts (e.g., sexual violence, rape) that discuss sexual matters without detailing behavior; these are generally relevant due to the explicit sexual context even if the emphasis is legal or safety-related.</narr>

	<desc>Aims to collect survey information about people's experiences with sexual advances or harassment at work and perceptions of how common sexual harassment against women is. Also seeks respondents' moral attitudes toward different sexual behaviors — same-sex relations, premarital sex, and extramarital sex — and whether a partner was a spouse or regular sexual partner.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "sexual" when it directly discusses sexual behavior, attitudes, or misconduct — for example the paragraph’s survey items about sexual advances at work, sexual relations between consenting adults (same‑sex or opposite‑sex), premarital sex, or extramarital affairs. Items that explicitly mention "sexual harassment," "sexual relations," or "sexual advances" are high‑value hits because they match the query intent and contain substantive questions or descriptions. A document is non‑relevant when the string "sexual" appears only incidentally or in unrelated contexts (e.g., "sexual reproduction" in a biology paper, the substring in "asexual"), or when the mention is perfunctory or part of boilerplate with no topical depth. Edge cases include ambiguous uses of "sex" (biological sex vs. sexual activity), negated statements ("not sexual"), quoted hypotheticals, and repeated/duplicated survey prompts — these can be relevant but may require semantic analysis to determine whether they truly match the user's informational need.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “sexual” when it substantively discusses sexual topics or uses the term in context, such as sexual behavior, sexuality, partnership, pregnancy, or contraceptive methods. The provided paragraph is relevant because it mentions a questionnaire on sexual behavior, measures knowledge about sexuality and contraception, references “overemphasis on the sexual” within an authoritarianism scale, and discusses research on sensitive topics including sexualities. It would be non-relevant if “sexual” appeared only incidentally (e.g., in a citation, author bio, or as part of a term like “asexual reproduction” unrelated to human sexuality) or if the main emphasis were entirely unrelated. Edge cases include morphological variants (sexual, sexuality, sexualities) and contexts focusing on methodology or ethics of studying online communications about sexual topics; these remain relevant if they engage the concept meaningfully. Conversely, documents about vulnerable communities that never address sexual issues, or that use “sexual” metaphorically without substantive content, should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>

<title>political orientation</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks scholarly research on how political and value orientations are conceptualized and measured and how they shape political behavior and attitudes—such as party choice, participation, trust, and views on issues like EU integration and immigration. They are interested in comparative evidence (especially Western vs. post-socialist Europe) and the role of conversational orientations in democratic engagement.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it conceptualizes, measures, or analyzes political orientations (e.g., left–right, conservative–liberal, religious–secular, materialist–postmaterialist) and links them to political outcomes such as party choice, participation, political trust, or attitudes toward migrants or European integration. For example, comparative studies of West European value orientations and party families, analyses proposing a feminist political orientation, postsocialist tests of the left–right–anti-immigrant association, or survey-based factor models that extract higher-order ideological dimensions (like post-materialist orientation) directly address political orientation. Research that treats conversational or democratic value orientations as antecedents to engagement or trust also qualifies when it explicitly ties these orientations to citizens’ political stances and behaviors. Non-relevant are pieces where “orientation” means policy emphasis (investor- or region-oriented policies), disciplinary/thematic orientation of political science, or discussions of Orientalism (the Orient), and duplicated entries that add no new analysis. Edge cases include elite “orientational structure” histories or civic-culture narratives, which are relevant only if orientations are operationalized as political attitudes or ideology rather than used descriptively or metaphorically.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks empirical research and survey evidence on political orientation—how it is measured (e.g., left–right self-placement, participation, trust, values) and what determines it—focusing on the relative impact of individual factors versus local/municipal context, particularly in Europe/Germany. They are looking for findings, datasets, and indices that assess these orientations across populations including youth.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it defines, measures, or analyzes political orientation at the individual or collective level—e.g., left–right self-placement, party preference and sympathy scales, attitudes toward democracy and institutions, political interest and participation, or value orientations (such as materialist/postmaterialist) that are explicitly linked to political beliefs. Studies examining contextual determinants of political orientations—like the impact of municipalities, Europeanization, or globalization on citizens’ ideological views—also qualify, including multilevel analyses combining individual and local data. Non-relevant material includes uses of “orientation” in non-political domains (consumer, price, innovation, or purely moral orientations) or generic political content that does not address ideological placement or related attitudinal constructs. Edge cases: “East/West orientation of the country” or “European orientations” can be relevant if the focus is on political alignment rather than geography; methodological and demographic inventories are relevant only insofar as they are tied to measuring or explaining political orientation. By contrast, logistical interview details, clothing and lifestyle topics, or youth culture content without a clear link to political beliefs should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>A concise definition and overview of "political orientation" — what it means (e.g., left–right, liberal–conservative, party identification) and how it’s commonly measured. Also information on how orientation affects behavior and attitudes (e.g., voting, inter-party cooperation, family influence) and typical survey items used to assess it.</desc>
	<narr>This document is partially relevant to the query "political orientation" because it contains direct survey items and labels that measure or ask about political alignment (for example, "I orient myself towards my child concerning politics" and the choice between MEP cooperation regardless of party vs. cooperation with similar political orientations, plus labels like Q145 EUROP PARLIAMENT MEMBER AFFILIATION). Relevant content includes questions about party affiliation, statements that ask respondents to place themselves politically, and items that explicitly mention political opinion or political orientations. Non-relevant text includes the long repeated blocks about humanitarian aid, discrimination screening, fashion and cultural matters, and metadata/repetition — these do not address ideological orientation unless the user specifically wants adjacent constructs (e.g., "political opinion" mentioned in the humanitarian-aid definition). Edge cases to watch: phrasing like "orient myself" can mean "influence" rather than "hold a political orientation," and many short codes and repeated strings are survey metadata rather than substantive measurement, so relevance should be judged by whether the passage elicits or records ideological self-placement or party/affiliation information.</narr>

	<desc>The user wants an overview of how political orientation and related socio‑political attitudes are conceptualized and measured. Specifically, they seek validated survey instruments (e.g., left–right self-placement, political efficacy, participation, cynicism) with their factors/subscales and evidence on reliability, validity, and cross-national comparability.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it defines, classifies, or measures political orientation (e.g., ideological self-placement such as left–right, conservative–liberal, or constructs like “politically tolerant orientation” and “conservative conformism”). This passage is relevant because it includes the Left–Right Self-Placement scale and multiple validated instruments tied to political attitudes and behavior (e.g., political cynicism, political efficacy PEKS/PESS, perceived political self-efficacy P-PSE, and various forms of political participation) that are commonly used to operationalize or correlate with political orientation in surveys. Content on political efficacy and participation is adjacent rather than definitional, but it often serves as an empirical proxy or correlate for orientation and so contributes useful context. By contrast, sections on managerial “task/relation/change/external orientation,” collective orientation in teams, acculturation orientation, and gender role orientations are non-relevant unless explicitly linked to ideological positioning. Edge cases include national pride (political vs cultural pride) and religiosity, which can indicate political orientation indirectly; they are relevant if used to locate individuals on an ideological spectrum, but otherwise may be tangential.</narr>

<title>sicherheit</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking academic literature on the concept of “security,” spanning inner/public, social, human, and IT security. They want definitions, critical frameworks, and German/European debates on security’s discursive construction and its relationship to freedom, migration, welfare policy, and resilience.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively engages the German concept of “Sicherheit” (security/safety), for example by analyzing inner/public security, societal or social security systems, security–freedom trade-offs, resilience, EU defense policy, migration and security, human security, or IT security. Pieces that define, historicize, compare, or critique security frameworks and discourses—such as societal security vs national security, the shift from repressive to preventive policing, critical security studies (Copenhagen/Paris/Aberystwyth), or the status and marketization of security—are strongly relevant. Texts on “soziale Sicherheit” (welfare, pensions) are relevant when they explicitly frame benefits as security regimes or rights; purely fiscal or administrative discussions with only incidental use of the term are less relevant. Non-relevant items include cases where “Sicherheit” appears only as an idiom (“mit Sicherheit” = certainly), a brand/proper noun, or as epistemic “certainty” without a safety/security context. Edge cases like Rechtssicherheit (legal certainty) or “Sicherheit” as social status count as relevant if they analyze the security concept or its societal effects, but not if the word is merely metaphorical or passing.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>Find survey-based datasets and analyses related to “Sicherheit” (security/safety) across Germany and Europe, including social security systems, personal and internal security perceptions, victimization and protective measures, workplace safety and health (ESENER), cyber/data protection, and defense policy. The user seeks studies with detailed measures, methodologies, and demographic variables.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it uses the German term “Sicherheit” or clear compounds of it (e.g., innere Sicherheit, Sicherheitsbehörden, Sicherheitsgefühl, Arbeitssicherheit/Arbeitsschutz, soziale Sicherheit/Sozialversicherung, Sicherheitspolitik) and substantively discusses safety/security in contexts such as public/internal security, workplace health and safety, social protection, national defense, nuclear safety, or internet security/data protection. Examples that fit include surveys on perceptions of inner security and crime, ESENER studies on occupational safety and psychosocial risks, evaluations of government security measures, NATO/EU security and defense topics, and modules on nuclear plant safety or cybersecurity and privacy. Non-relevant material would be text that lacks the concept or uses “Sicherheit” in an unrelated sense (e.g., “Sicherheit” as certainty/assurance, “Sicherung” as a fuse or backup) or sections like sunbathing habits that do not connect to safety/security; purely demographic lists without security content also do not qualify. Edge cases include relevant synonyms without the exact keyword (Schutz, Gefahrenabwehr, Arbeitsschutz) or compounds like Sicherheitslage/Sicherheitsgefühl that should count, while adjectival “sicher” meaning “sure” may not. In multi-topic surveys, documents remain relevant if they contain a distinct section on security (even among many themes), but items that only name-drop “Sicherheit” in a checklist without explanation are marginal.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>The user wants to know how people perceive safety in different areas—public places, law and order in Germany, internet security, job security and social security—and whether they feel personally protected. They also seek to identify which aspects of security respondents find lacking today.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "Sicherheit" when it explicitly discusses security-related topics—such as "Sicherheit im Internet" (internet security), "Sicherheit des Arbeitsplatzes" (workplace security), "soziale Sicherheit" (social security), or safety in public places—as in the supplied paragraph which lists survey questions about those areas. It is non-relevant when the term appears only incidentally (for example in a compound noun unrelated to the user's intent, a brand name, or as repeated survey codes like V274 without substantive content) or when the word occurs in a different language context that changes meaning. Edge cases include terse transcripts or questionnaires that name the topic but give no explanatory content (these are partially relevant because they indicate subject matter but lack depth), and technical documents about safety equipment or legal regulations which may be relevant only if the user seeks that specific angle. Finally, relevance depends on user intent: a broad query for "Sicherheit" makes any of the above topics useful, whereas a query for a specific subtype (e.g., cyber security vs. social security) requires matching that particular term or related synonyms to be truly relevant.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking information on “Sicherheit” in the sense of psychological safety in teams—its definition, importance for learning and performance, and validated measurement tools (e.g., PsySafety Check, HPTS). They may also want how notions of security/safety feature in related constructs like authoritarian attitudes and ambivalent sexism.</desc>
	<narr>This document is relevant to the query “sicherheit” insofar as it focuses on psychological safety in teams, repeatedly using the term in contexts like “psychologische Sicherheit,” feelings of safety in relationships, and seeking safety in authority, and it describes validated instruments (PsySafety Check, HPTS) that measure this construct. It will be highly relevant for users interested in team climate, organizational behavior, or psychometrics (e.g., how psychological safety predicts learning and performance), and partially relevant for sociological takes on security-seeking tendencies. It is not relevant if the intent is cybersecurity/IT-Sicherheit, physical or occupational safety regulations, public/national security, or technical risk mitigation, since none of those are covered. Edge cases: keyword matching will still hit on “Sicherheit” within phrases like “psychologische Sicherheit” or in scales about sexism and authoritarianism, which may produce false positives for users expecting technical security; conversely, related terms like “Geborgenheit” and “Schutz” appear alongside “Sicherheit” and may aid recall if semantic expansion is used.</narr>

<title>selbstdarstellung</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking scholarly discussions of Selbstdarstellung (self-presentation/self-representation) across media, social, and political contexts, including reality TV, social networks, and national identity. The focus is on strategies, authenticity, audience reception, and the sociocultural conditions driving self-presentation in late modernity.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly examines Selbstdarstellung (self-presentation) as a practice or concept—whether by individuals, groups, or states—and discusses its purposes, strategies, or reception. Clear examples include empirical or theoretical analyses of reality TV contestants managing impressions (e.g., Big Brother, ingratiation vs. self-promotion and perceived authenticity), photographic self-representations of youth on social media, online dating profile misrepresentation, talk show performance of privacy, or national self-presentation in foreign policy and identity management (e.g., post-reunification Germany, Switzerland, or political leaders’ image-building). Synonyms and close German terms such as Selbstinszenierung, Selbstrepräsentation, Präsentation des Selbst, or plural/compound variants (Selbstdarstellungen, kulturelle Selbstdarstellung, live posting) also signal relevance if the focus remains on how selves are staged and perceived. By contrast, documents are non-relevant when Selbstdarstellung is only a passing label, appears solely in metadata, or “Darstellung” refers to the depiction of non-self subjects without analyzing impression management or identity performance. Edge cases include metaphorical uses (e.g., institutional branding) that are still relevant if they analyze self-staging mechanisms and audience reception, and language variants (German vs. English “self-presentation”) that should be included if they address the same concept.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user wants to locate German survey datasets or questionnaire sections that measure “Selbstdarstellung” (self-presentation), especially within election studies and modules on political attitudes. They seek items on candidate self-presentation and individual self-presentation alongside related scales on prejudice, authoritarianism, and social integration.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “selbstdarstellung” when it explicitly addresses self-presentation—how people or actors present themselves to others—such as survey items or analyses on “Selbstdarstellung der Wahlkreiskandidaten im Wahlkampf” or statements about “Ideenlosigkeit zur Selbstdarstellung.” It also counts if it operationalizes the concept (questions, scales, variables, results) in political communication, social psychology, or media contexts, including motives, strategies, or perceived effects of self-presentation. Documents are non-relevant if they only discuss other “Selbst-” constructs (e.g., Selbsteinschätzung, Selbsteinstufung, Selbstverantwortung) or focus solely on prejudice, economic assessments, or party preferences without any link to how someone presents themselves. Edge cases include synonyms or near-synonyms like Selbstinszenierung or Außendarstellung, plural or hyphenated forms (Selbstdarstellungen, Selbst-Darstellung), and lists that merely mention the term; a mere variable label can still be relevant, while “Darstellung” of parties or media portrayal that is not self-directed generally is not.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for a short written self-presentation ("Selbstdarstellung")—either a ready-made paragraph or guidance on how to write one—to introduce themselves for applications, profiles, or introductions. They need concise advice or an example that covers background, strengths, and goals in an appropriate tone and structure.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "selbstdarstellung" when it centrally discusses self‑presentation—definitions, theories from psychology or communication studies, practical tips for crafting a personal profile (e.g., CV, LinkedIn, artist statement), or concrete examples of how people present themselves online and offline. Useful signals are the term appearing in headings, abstracts, or the first paragraphs, detailed case studies or templates, and comparisons to related concepts like "Selbstmarketing" or "Impression Management." A document is non‑relevant if the word appears only once in passing, if the page is primarily about an unrelated topic (for example a product named “Selbstdarstellung” with no explanatory content), or if the content is purely visual with no textual explanation. Edge cases include materials in other languages using the translation "self‑presentation" (which may still be relevant), academic papers that mention the term only in literature review, and artistic discussions where "Selbstdarstellung" refers specifically to genre conventions rather than practical self‑marketing—these may be relevant depending on whether the user seeks theoretical, practical, or creative perspectives.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking information on self-presentation in psychology, particularly a German self-monitoring measure that assesses sensitivity to others’ expressive behavior and the ability to modify one’s self-presentation (the German version of the Lennox & Wolfe, 1984 scale).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it discusses “Selbstdarstellung” specifically in the psychological sense of self-presentation as operationalized by the German adaptation of the Lennox & Wolfe (1984) Self-Monitoring Scale, especially mentioning its subscales like sensitivity to others’ expressive behavior and the ability to modify one’s self-presentation. Content that describes, validates, translates, or applies this German questionnaire (e.g., psychometric properties, sample items) or ties self-presentation to self-monitoring in interpersonal communication also counts as relevant. Partially relevant items include broader work on self-presentation/self-monitoring (e.g., Snyder’s Self-Monitoring Scale, impression management, Goffman’s presentation of self) or texts using close terms like “Selbstpräsentation” or the English “self-presentation,” even if not the exact German Lennox & Wolfe scale. Non-relevant are uses of “Selbstdarstellung” in non-psychological contexts—artistic self-portraits, political PR/branding, corporate image crafting, or website bios—where no psychological measurement or modification-of-self-presentation construct is involved. Edge cases include papers that merely cite the scale without describing it, or “self monitoring” in health/tech systems; these are low relevance unless they explicitly assess the two stated subscales.</narr>

<title>haushaltseinkommen</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks information on household income (Haushaltseinkommen) in Germany—its definition, measurement, distribution, and key determinants. They likely want evidence on trends and inequality and how household income interacts with taxes, pensions, employment status, and living standards.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly analyzes household income—its level, distribution, determinants, or policy impacts—or uses it as a core variable (e.g., tax progression on household income, EVS/SOEP studies of income mobility and inequality, COVID-19 shocks to household income, or couple-level contributions to household income). Studies that relate household income to outcomes such as nutrition, life satisfaction, or willingness to work in retirement, or that model burdens relative to disposable/net household income (e.g., VAT microsimulations), also count as relevant. Methodological pieces that define “private household,” discuss equivalized or per-capita measures, or compare “disposable” vs “gross” household income are relevant because they affect how household income is measured and interpreted. Documents are only partially relevant if household income appears merely as a control or background descriptor without substantive analysis. They are non-relevant if they focus solely on individual earnings/wealth or unrelated topics and mention household income only in passing, or if they analyze household wealth or expenditures without linking them to household income.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking data or analysis on household income as a demographic variable in German surveys, including its measurement, distribution, and links to household characteristics, economic conditions, and political preferences.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “haushaltseinkommen” when it explicitly discusses household income—e.g., reports or surveys that measure, compare, or analyze household income by demographics (age, education, occupation), region, or over time, or relate it to macro topics like unemployment and price developments. Entries that list “Haushaltseinkommen” as a survey variable or demographic attribute (such as in topic lists of economic or election studies) are relevant, though they may be lower priority if they only enumerate variables without analysis. Synonyms and close variants—“Nettohaushaltseinkommen,” “Familieneinkommen,” “Äquivalenzeinkommen,” “HH‑Einkommen,” the genitive “Haushaltseinkommens,” or the English “household income”—also count. Non-relevant items include uses of “Haushalt” meaning a public budget (“Staatshaushalt,” “Haushaltsplan”) or documents discussing “Einkommen” in general without a household context. Edge cases include OCR/line-break variants (“Haushalts­einkommen,” hyphenation), metadata-only mentions, or duplicate listings; these still match but may provide little substantive information.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The query seeks survey information about household net income: which income bracket the household falls into, the respondent’s and the household’s net income for the last month, and how many people (including pensioners, scholarship recipients, etc.) contribute to that income. It also asks for a subjective assessment of how easy or difficult it currently is for the household to make ends meet.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly deals with "Haushaltseinkommen" — for example survey questions, codebook entries or variable definitions that ask for monthly net household income after taxes and social security, income-class categories (e.g. s09, s09hhek, ekdm), or instructions to include all income sources (wages, pensions, stipends). Text that reproduces the questionnaire wording (How high was your personal/net household income last month? How many people contribute?) or lists the specific income bands (including historical DM categories) is highly relevant because it matches the query intent exactly. It is non‑relevant if the document only mentions individual gross income, corporate revenues, household chores, or uses "Haushalt" in a non‑income sense, or if it merely cites the term without any definitions or question text. Edge cases include translations or abridged summaries (potentially relevant if they preserve the monthly net/inclusion rules), materials using a different reference period or currency (annual vs monthly, EUR vs DM) which may require normalization, and machine‑read transcripts or repeated boilerplate that contain the keywords but lack usable metadata or context.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses household income (Haushaltseinkommen) or closely related constructs, such as survey items capturing household income, methods for classed income in the Mikrozensus, or tools for deriving poverty measures from household income (e.g., syntax to compute household-specific poverty probabilities). For example, reports describing pretests of standard questions that include household income or methodological papers discussing biases from using class midpoints in income classes are clearly relevant. Content focused only on other topics in the same studies (e.g., religion or COVID-19) without substantive discussion of income, or discussing individual earnings without linking to household-level measures, would be non-relevant. Edge cases include documents mentioning household composition or education that are relevant only if tied to the construction or equivalization of household income, and texts using synonyms like “equivalized household income” or “income classes of the household,” which should still count as relevant.</narr>

<title>schulische bildung</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The query seeks research-based overviews of school education in Germany, with emphasis on the goals and practices of political education (including extremism prevention and socio-political approaches). It also looks for evidence on vocational preparation and reform, inclusion and education for sustainable development, and how family and migration backgrounds shape students’ outcomes and labor market risks.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “schulische bildung” if it examines education within the school system (primarily primary and secondary) or school-based learning contexts, such as political education curricula, inclusion in schools, vocational schooling within the dual system, or family influences on students’ school trajectories. Examples include analyses of extremism prevention embedded in school political education in NRW, studies of how youths with migration background experience politics classes, integrations of Education for Sustainable Development into social-science subjects, or evaluations of school-based internships and career orientation. It is also relevant when theoretical or empirical work is explicitly tied to school institutions (e.g., applying Bourdieu’s concepts to schooling, PISA-driven reforms, or the impact of missing school/vocational certificates on labor-market risks). Non-relevant are pieces focused on higher education, adult or purely extracurricular education, company-only training without a school component, or general policy topics (e.g., urban transport or economic theory) that are not didactically linked to school teaching. Edge cases include articles on the “außer-schulische” social/education sector (only relevant if connected back to schools), or topical societal debates that are relevant when framed as content and methods for school political education but not when presented without any pedagogical link.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks an overview of school education in Germany, including system structures, curricula, and the role of parents and cultural education in children’s development. It also looks for empirical findings and datasets on educational pathways, competencies, transitions, and inequalities (e.g., by migration background or region) across historical and contemporary studies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses formal school education (primary and secondary)—for example, curricula, school types and transitions (e.g., 4th grade to Gymnasium/Realschule), classroom practices, teacher cooperation, student competencies (IQB studies), or parental roles in school-based cultural education. Items describing the DDR school structure (POS/EOS), gifted education measures, or participation in “schulische und außerschulische” offerings that explicitly compare or anchor the analysis in the school context are clearly in scope. By contrast, works focused mainly on adult/continuing education (Weiterbildung, PIAAC for adults), higher education, labor-market mobility, or historical qualification crises in public service—where “schulische Bildung” appears only as a background variable—are not relevant. Edge cases include mixed studies spanning school and vocational/tertiary sectors; these are relevant if they contain dedicated analysis of school-age populations or school-based programs, and cultural education counts when it is explicitly situated in schools rather than solely out-of-school contexts. German variants like “Schulbildung,” “allgemeinbildende Schule,” and “schulische Bildungsgänge” are strong signals, but mere keyword mentions in long variable lists without substantive discussion should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for information about school education in Germany, specifically public attitudes on whether enough is being done for schools and how recent changes in school or vocational training (over the last 12 months) affect career prospects. They also want to capture related survey concerns such as interrupted career plans, inability to finish apprenticeships, fewer suitable training places, underemployment or involuntary part‑time work, and planning of professional careers.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "schulische bildung" if it focuses on school education in Germany—discussing school quality, policy debates (for example, "Wird in Deutschland genug für Schulen getan?"), or first-hand and survey-based accounts of pupils’ and apprentices’ experiences. Relevant examples include analyses of vocational training outcomes (completion rates, fewer apprenticeship places, later underemployment), survey questions about changes to one’s school or vocational education in the last 12 months, and policy proposals affecting schools. Non-relevant documents are those about unrelated topics (e.g., the founding of the Federal Republic), texts that only contain repeated codes or filler without substantive education content, or pieces that treat "Bildung" only as a vague term for lifelong learning or higher education without addressing schools. Edge cases include materials that mention schools only in passing, survey instruments that list questions without results (useful for methodology but limited for content), or documents in another language—these can be partially relevant depending on whether they provide concrete information about school education in Germany.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks an overview of how school education (educational attainment) is conceptualized, measured, and coded in national and international surveys—distinguishing it from competencies and ensuring cross-country comparability (e.g., ISCED, CASMIN). They also want examples from German research on youth self-efficacy and educational aspirations (e.g., RISS, GIP), plus approaches for measuring education among migrants.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it addresses school-based education (schulische Bildung) such as students’ experiences, decisions, or outcomes within primary/secondary schooling—for example, studies of adolescents’ self-efficacy in the school context, parental vs. realistic educational aspirations, or the use of ISCED/CASMIN to classify school attainment across countries. Methodological pieces on how “education” is conceptualized, measured, and coded in surveys are relevant when they explicitly pertain to schooling levels or to comparing school qualifications (including approaches for migrants whose credentials must be mapped to German school categories). Content focused mainly on non-school settings—adult/continuing education, generic political attitudes or reform preferences without a schooling angle, higher education only, or psychological scales applied outside school (e.g., a curiosity inventory with no school framing)—is less relevant. Edge cases include papers using “Bildung” broadly: they are relevant if they link attitudes or indicators to school-level qualifications or decisions, but not if they focus on competencies, grades, or vocational training detached from the schulische setting. For example, an analysis of ISCED 1997 implementation for census schooling data is relevant, whereas a reforms monitor about taxes or pensions is not unless it specifically examines school reforms.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks a concise synthesis of how “security” has evolved from a traditional, state–military concept to a multidimensional agenda encompassing human, climate, cyber, energy, economic, and health security, informed by critical security theories. They want comparative insights into regional policies and governance (e.g., Japan, China, ASEAN, Africa, Europe, UN), including case studies and policy options for integrating non-traditional security into national and international frameworks.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively analyzes security as a concept, policy domain, or set of threats, for example discussions of climate security in Japan, human security in China or ASEAN, or domain-specific areas like cyber, energy, economic, and intelligence-driven national security. Theoretical and analytical pieces that define or critique security (e.g., Copenhagen/Paris/Aberystwyth schools, security governance, Foucault’s security dispositive) are also relevant because they shape what “security” means and how it is practiced. Empirical case studies of institutions and regions—UN Security Council reform, SADC/ECOWAS responses to COVID-19, transatlantic security architectures, or systemic IT security illustrated by Mirai and WannaCry—clearly qualify, regardless of language, if they center on security policy, actors, and outcomes. By contrast, documents are non-relevant when “security” is incidental or refers to unrelated notions such as financial securities, job security, security deposits, or passing mentions without conceptual or policy analysis. Edge cases include historical treatments of “gute Policey” or comprehensive security that remain relevant if they trace the evolution of security practices, and technology or development pieces that are only relevant when they explicitly frame risks, governance, or protections as security issues rather than generic safety or management concerns.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>Find studies and survey datasets on “security” in multiple senses—social security systems, perceptions of internal/public safety, surveillance and data retention, defense/foreign policy, and security sector reform. Emphasis is on Germany and Europe (plus a Syrian SSR survey in Germany), covering attitudes, experiences, institutions, and survey methodologies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “security” when it substantively addresses public safety, security sector reform, internal security policy, defense and policing, surveillance/data retention, cyber/Internet security, or citizens’ perceptions and trust in security institutions (e.g., surveys on Syrians’ views of security sector reform, German public opinion on CCTV and airport measures, or attitudes toward the Bundeswehr). Methodological descriptions of such studies (samples, CATI/CAWI, weighting) remain relevant if they investigate security outcomes like fear of crime, civilian oversight, or data protection against online threats. Content focused on “social security” as welfare systems (pensions, health insurance, family allowances, FRG–GDR comparisons) may be only marginally relevant unless the user intent clearly includes welfare-state security; otherwise these are typically non-relevant for safety/defense-oriented searches. Edge cases include “security” meaning job security or housing security (usually non-relevant) versus Internet security topics like viruses, fraud, and data protection (relevant). Documents that only mention “security” in passing (e.g., as a keyword or funding note) or that solely present historical social expenditure without linkage to safety, crime, defense, or security institutions should be considered non-relevant.</narr>

	<desc>The query seeks survey information on "security," specifically asking what makes people feel financially secure and whether they consider their own financial position secure. It also asks about respondents' awareness of EU external border initiatives (e.g., Frontex, ETIAS, EES, SIS, VIS, Internal Security Fund) and how important they view internal security challenges like terrorism and border protection.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "security" when it explicitly addresses security topics, such as personal financial security (questions about what makes you feel financially secure or whether your financial position is secure) or public/internal security (importance of terrorism or EU border security and awareness of initiatives like FRONTEX, ETIAS, EES, SIS, VIS). For example, the listed variables Q21 and Q22A about financial position and savings, and qa19/qa3/qb2 about awareness of border initiatives and the importance of terrorism/EU borders, are clear signals of relevance. A document is non-relevant when it only contains unrelated administrative codes, repeated labels with no substantive content, or discusses an unrelated sense of security (e.g., software/IT security) that does not match the user's intended topics. Edge cases include brief code-lists or variable names that imply security questions—these can be considered marginally relevant if no question text is present, and ambiguous uses of "secure" (secure employment vs cybersecurity) should be judged by surrounding context. Prioritize texts that explicitly mention financial security, terrorism, border control, or named EU initiatives as highly relevant; treat vague or context-free mentions as low relevance.</narr>

	<desc>The user is looking for how “security” is defined and measured in social/psychological surveys, including as a value, a sense of safety/stability, and financial/material security. They want examples of relevant scales or items (e.g., Human Values Scale, Authoritarian Attitudes, Secure Flourish Index) that capture this construct.</desc>
	<narr>For the query “security,” a document is relevant if it substantively addresses security as a condition or value—e.g., personal safety, psychological protection, institutional protection, or financial/material stability—rather than only naming the word. This paragraph is relevant because it discusses security across multiple social-science scales: security as a feeling within ambivalent sexism, retreat to protective authorities in authoritarian attitudes, “security” as a core value in the Human Values Scale, and financial/material security in the Secure Flourish Index. It would be less relevant if “security” appeared only incidentally (e.g., a passing adjective) or referred to unrelated homonyms like financial “securities.” Edge cases include user intent: if the user seeks cybersecurity or national security, this document is only tangentially relevant; if they seek psychological, social, or well-being dimensions of security, it is highly relevant.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks an analytical overview of political participation—its forms, levels, and trends—across countries and generations, and how determinants like political knowledge, efficacy, income/inequality, social networks, workplace practices, and institutions shape engagement. They also want evidence on causal pathways (including familial/genetic confounds), differences between online and offline modes, and implications for theories and policies to boost participation.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly analyzes, defines, measures, or explains political participation—such as voting, contacting officials, petitioning, protesting, campaigning, or online engagement—and its determinants (e.g., political interest, knowledge, efficacy, resources), consequences, or trends across groups or countries. Empirical studies using designs like discordant twins, cross-national surveys (e.g., CSES, ISSP, ALLBUS), or mediation models linking knowledge to efficacy to participation, as well as research on generational change, post-communist or Latin American contexts, inequality’s effects, workplace spillover, or social networks’ mobilization, are all clearly relevant. A document is non-relevant if “participation” refers to non-political domains without an explicit spillover to politics, or if it discusses democracy, institutions, or policy in general without analyzing political behavior or intentions to participate. Edge cases include theoretical pieces: they remain relevant if they specify mechanisms or classify forms of participation, while studies on knowledge, efficacy, or interest are only relevant when they explicitly connect these attitudes to participation. Similarly, work on civic education or social media that merely describes usage without linking it to turnout or political acts is borderline, whereas studies distinguishing conventional vs. unconventional, formal vs. informal, or online vs. offline participation are relevant.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking surveys and datasets that measure political participation (voting, protest, organizational and online engagement) and related attitudes (interest, efficacy, alienation), along with rich demographics and socialization factors across different groups and time periods. The goal is to analyze the drivers, forms, and trends of participation—primarily in Germany but also in other European contexts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it describes behaviors, readiness, or opportunities for political participation—such as voting, protesting, contacting politicians, signing petitions (online or offline), party or union membership, or participation in civic initiatives—and often pairs these with measures like political interest, efficacy, alienation, or the Kaase index. Content detailing contexts where participation occurs (e.g., municipal renovation protests in German cities, Bundeswehr members’ political attitudes, online political activities like letters to the editor, signature campaigns, or donations) and the demographic or social predictors of participation (education, class, religion, media use) also fits. Documents focused on closely related attitudes and intentions (e.g., protest willingness, perceived influence, postmaterialism) are typically relevant, especially when linked to concrete participatory acts or scales. Non-relevant items would be those using “participation” only in non-political domains (family or school participation without a political dimension), or that discuss politics solely as opinion or policy issues (e.g., climate change or anti-Americanism) without tying them to participatory behavior. Edge cases include media-use or wellbeing surveys that are relevant only if they explicitly measure political engagement outcomes, and union or student-organization elections that count when they analyze political behavior rather than purely internal administrative participation.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for how "political participation" is measured in survey data — the specific questionnaire items and variables that capture different forms of engagement (e.g., party membership and activity, frequency of participation in political groups, online discussion/sharing, self-rated involvement, and encouragement to vote). They also want details on topic-specific items (EU enlargement/defence debates), longitudinal participation indicators, and variable coding/derivations.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "political participation" when it directly addresses citizens' political actions or engagement — e.g., survey questions or variables about attending party activities, belonging to a political party, voting intentions, following or taking part in online election discussions, or using new technologies to express political opinions. Good examples are items like "In the past 12 months how often have you participated in activities of political parties…" or Q12 entries about online voting and expressing opinion, and membership/status items that distinguish belonging and active participation. A document is less relevant if it only discusses states' or institutions' participation (for example Ireland joining a collective EU defence), reports policy attitudes without any behavioral participation measures, or contains only administrative variable codes with no question text. Edge cases include texts that use the word "participation" in non-political contexts (child or household participation in longitudinal waves) or repeated metadata where the question intent is unclear; these should be checked for accompanying question wording before being treated as relevant. In practice, prioritize documents with explicit participation behaviors, frequency measures, or membership/online-engagement items; deprioritize ones with only topic opinions, institutional participation, or bare variable identifiers.</narr>

	<desc>The user is looking for how political participation is defined and categorized (e.g., formal vs. informal) and how it is measured, including validated scales and predictors like internal/external political efficacy and partisan identity. They also want information on research methods (surveys, web tracking) and evidence on the validity and cross-cultural applicability of these measures.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it defines, categorizes, measures, or explains political participation—for example, discussions of formal vs. informal or demonstrative vs. passive participation, and validated instruments that assess participation or its drivers. Studies that validate constructs closely tied to participation and show predictive links (e.g., Perceived Political Self-Efficacy/P-PSE, the Political Efficacy Short Scale, or partisan identity scales used to predict turnout and engagement) are clearly on-topic, as are method pieces that apply web tracking to analyze online political participation. Content on adjacent attitudes (political cynicism, satisfaction with the political system, left–right placement, conservatism, or political pride) is only relevant if it explicitly connects those attitudes to participation behavior or propensity. Materials about survey logistics (e.g., postal survey recruitment), epistemology debates, rescue training exam feedback, or asylum-attitude measurements are non-relevant unless they directly assess or influence political participation. Edge cases include uses of “participation” that mean survey or training participation (not political), and social media discussions that matter only when they address how platforms shape political engagement.</narr>

<title>selbstwirksamkeit</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an overview of self-efficacy (Selbstwirksamkeit), including how it is defined and measured and its effects across domains like education, sports, climate action, well-being, and civic participation. They also want evidence on factors and interventions that strengthen self-efficacy and how it correlates with experience, support, and engagement.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses Selbstwirksamkeit (self-efficacy) as a construct—e.g., defines it, measures it with scales, analyzes its predictors or outcomes, or tests interventions that strengthen it. Clear examples include studies on Selbstwirksamkeitserwartung in specific domains (such as riders or horse‑assisted stress coaching), climate-education projects that raise klimabezogene Selbstwirksamkeit, political or career-choice self-efficacy in youth, or analyses of how computer games foster self-efficacy experiences. Partially relevant are pieces that use the concept to frame results (e.g., refugees navigating between self-efficacy and external control, community initiatives cultivating perceived agency) but do not operationalize or analyze it in depth. Non-relevant are texts that only discuss Wirksamkeit (effectiveness), empowerment, or agency without the “self-” construct, or that mention Selbstwirksamkeit only in passing without data, theory, or substantive discussion; likewise, adjacent notions (e.g., a generic “Beteiligungsselbstkonzept”) may be borderline if self-efficacy isn’t the focus. Edge cases to include are compound and domain-tagged variants like Selbstwirksamkeitserwartung, Selbstwirksamkeitserleben, politische/klimabezogene/berufswahlbezogene Selbstwirksamkeit, and instances with OCR or hyphenation artifacts.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>Find studies and datasets that measure self-efficacy (Selbstwirksamkeit), including definitions, validated scales, and survey items, particularly within German/European social research on youth development, parenting/education, entrepreneurship, coping with post-reunification change, and value orientations.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly addresses Selbstwirksamkeit (self-efficacy), for example by including a “Selbstwirksamkeit” scale, reporting results on general or domain-specific self-efficacy (e.g., parental/learning self-efficacy, coping self-efficacy), or evaluating an intervention’s effect on self-efficacy. Surveys or panels that list “Skala/Skalometer Selbstwirksamkeit,” “Allgemeine Selbstwirksamkeit,” or equivalent English terms (self-efficacy, GSE) count as relevant even if they primarily describe measurement design or item wording rather than outcomes. It is non-relevant if it only treats adjacent constructs such as self-esteem (Selbstwertgefühl), autonomy/self-determination (Autonomie, Selbstbestimmung), self-responsibility (Selbstverantwortlichkeit), or resilience without measuring or analyzing self-efficacy. An edge case is domain labeling: parental or academic self-efficacy is relevant, but references to “Selbstständige” (the self-employed) or other “Selbst-” terms are not. Brief topical lists that explicitly include “Selbstwirksamkeit” (e.g., among personality scales in youth, entrepreneurship, or European value surveys) are still relevant, whereas mere tangential mentions in citations or metadata are not.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for a clear definition and explanation of "Selbstwirksamkeit" (self-efficacy), including its psychological role in motivation and behavior change, how it’s measured, and practical ways to strengthen it.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "selbstwirksamkeit" if it directly discusses the concept of self‑efficacy — for example defining Bandura’s theory, describing measurement tools like the General Self‑Efficacy Scale, reporting interventions to boost self‑efficacy in education, health or workplace settings, or giving concrete examples of self‑efficacy change. Relevant documents often include empirical studies, literature reviews, clinical or educational guides, and translated texts that explicitly equate "selbstwirksamkeit" with "self‑efficacy." Non‑relevant documents merely containing the word in a list or passing mention, focusing on different constructs (e.g., self‑esteem, confidence) without addressing efficacy beliefs, or using the term in an unrelated technical or legal sense should be treated as low relevance. Edge cases include German vs. English materials (a paper using only the English term "self‑efficacy" is still relevant), compound or inflected forms (selbstwirksamkeitserfahrung, selbstwirksamkeitsüberzeugung), and domain‑specific uses where a paper may be relevant only to a particular context (e.g., academic self‑efficacy) rather than to general theory. Assess relevance by checking whether the document provides conceptual explanation, empirical evidence, measurement details, or practical guidance about self‑efficacy rather than a brief or tangential mention.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking an overview of self-efficacy (distinguishing general vs domain-specific) and validated German measures of it, such as the SESW for study entry and team process/collective self-efficacy instruments. They likely want psychometric evidence (reliability/validity) and applications in educational and political contexts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “selbstwirksamkeit” if it explicitly defines or discusses self-efficacy (e.g., citing Bandura 1977 or distinguishing general vs. domain-specific self-efficacy) or presents/validates measures of it, such as scales for student entry self-efficacy (SESW) or efficacy beliefs in education and politics, with psychometric details like Cronbach’s alpha or omega. Content that applies self-efficacy in concrete contexts—school transitions, political participation, or teams (including collective self-efficacy)—is also relevant, especially when it links the construct to outcomes or provides validated questionnaires. Documents are only weakly relevant if self-efficacy is mentioned tangentially (e.g., a team-process instrument that merely lists collective self-efficacy as a correlate without defining or measuring it). Non-relevant items include uses of “Wirksamkeit” meaning intervention/drug effectiveness rather than beliefs about one’s capability, or pieces that report procedural details (e.g., interview methods) without substantive self-efficacy content. Edge cases include synonyms and abbreviations (self-efficacy, efficacy beliefs, Wirksamkeitsüberzeugungen, SESW) and articles where self-efficacy appears only in references or footnotes rather than the main analysis.</narr>

<title>selbstverwirklichung</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an overview of “Selbstverwirklichung” (self-realization) as a social and philosophical concept, especially in modern work, examining its promises and risks—how autonomy and flexibility are mobilized by institutions and labor markets, sometimes producing self-exploitation or alienation. They likely want scholarly perspectives across sociology, philosophy, education, gender, and social policy, including historical context and critical theory debates.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively analyzes, defines, or empirically examines Selbstverwirklichung (self-realization), for example in work and employment (flexible hours, subjectivation of labor, HR practices), social policy (pensions or disability insurance shaping possibilities for self-fulfillment), education (as a pedagogical goal), psychology (humanistic or feminist theories), or philosophy (normative frameworks). Pieces that explore tensions—such as how quests for autonomy and authenticity can flip into self-alienation under market pressures, or how institutions instrumentalize self-realization for productivity—are strongly relevant. By contrast, texts that only mention the term in passing (e.g., a marketing blurb, a checklist of values, or a generic statement like “work offers self-realization”) without conceptual depth, evidence, or sustained discussion are weakly relevant or non-relevant; so are works about self-care or self-employment that never connect to self-realization. Edge cases include historical or biographical studies that focus on specific groups (e.g., unemployed academics, single parents, or thinkers like Karen Horney): they are relevant if they trace how self-realization is enabled, constrained, or redefined, but not if the term is merely a rhetorical aside. Depth of treatment—clear definitions, theoretical or normative argument, operationalization, and empirical findings—raises relevance, while metaphorical, incidental, or untranslated-synonym-free mentions lower it; English equivalents like “self-actualization” can also signal relevance.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks survey-based insights on “Selbstverwirklichung” (self-actualization) in Germany—how it is defined, valued, and pursued across domains like leisure, work, family, and culture, and which factors correlate with or hinder it. It aims to identify measures, attitudes, motives, and pathways to self-realization reported in the referenced studies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “selbstverwirklichung” when it explicitly discusses self-fulfillment as a value, motive, or outcome, such as “Wege der Selbstverwirklichung,” the importance of self-realization in work or leisure, or survey/value batteries that include Selbstverwirklichung alongside items like Leistung, Pflichtbewusstsein, or Leben genießen. Content that operationalizes or measures the concept (e.g., attitudes toward self-actualization, goals like “Selbstverwirklichung im Fach,” or the role of culture, hobbies, and reading as avenues of self-realization) is highly relevant, even if embedded in broader studies on lifestyle, politics, or work-life balance. Documents referencing related constructs in recognized frameworks (e.g., postmaterialist values, autonomy and self-direction) or synonyms like Selbstentfaltung also count. Non-relevant items include texts that only list demographics or unrelated topics without linking to self-fulfillment, or false positives where similar words (e.g., Selbstständigkeit for self-employment or Selbstverwaltung for self-administration) appear without conceptual overlap. Edge cases include long topic lists that mention Selbstverwirklichung only once; these are still relevant if they indicate measurement or discussion, but marginal if the term is merely name-checked without context or analysis.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants to assess how important self-fulfillment/self-actualization (selbstverwirklichung) is to a person when considering their life goals, using a 1–7 importance scale. They need clear instructions or a concise definition so respondents can reliably rate the personal importance of self-realization.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "selbstverwirklichung" if it explicitly addresses self-realization or closely related ideas such as personal goals, life aspirations, value priorities, or measures of psychological growth. The supplied paragraph is relevant because it directly asks respondents to reflect on "what you actually strive for in your life" and to rate the importance of those items on a 1–7 scale, which is a survey approach to assessing self-fulfillment. Other clearly relevant examples include psychological discussions (e.g., Maslow’s self-actualization), interviews or personal essays about achieving one’s potential, and validated scales or survey items that operationalize self-realization. Non-relevant documents are those that only mention the term in passing, use it as a brand or headline unrelated to meaning, or cover unrelated topics (technical manuals, recipes, legal notices); boilerplate survey templates that never list substantive life-goals are borderline relevant but less useful than items that actually probe specific aspirations. Edge cases include translations or metaphorical uses where the term appears but the content does not explore personal striving, which should be judged less relevant unless context shows a thematic focus on self-realization.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks an explanation of “self-actualization” as a dimension of general job satisfaction—how personal fulfillment at work is assessed within a 37-item instrument alongside resignation, pay satisfaction, and company evaluation.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it defines, discusses, or operationalizes Selbstverwirklichung (self-actualization/self-fulfillment), especially in work or psychology, for example by presenting items or scales that measure autonomy, creativity, meaning, or personal growth. Content like a job-satisfaction instrument that includes Selbstverwirklichung as one of several dimensions (alongside resignation, pay satisfaction, or company evaluation) is relevant because it provides a concrete framework for assessing the concept. Discussions of Maslow’s hierarchy, workplace enrichment, or German/English terminology equivalents (e.g., self-actualization, Selbstverwirklichungsbedürfnis) also count. Non-relevant documents focus solely on other facets (e.g., pay or general company assessment) without substantive treatment of Selbstverwirklichung, or only name-drop the term without definition, examples, or metrics. Edge cases include confusion with related but distinct terms like Selbstwirksamkeit (self-efficacy) or Selbstbestimmung (self-determination), hyphenation/line-break variants (Selbst­verwirklichung), and brand or poetic uses that don’t address the psychological construct.</narr>

<title>sex</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking scholarly, policy, and cross-national research on sex in society, including sex work, sexual violence and regulation, demographic patterns of same-sex couples, gender disparities, and public attitudes. They also need methodological studies on measuring sex and gender in surveys and health research and the impacts of data classification changes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively engages the concept or term “sex,” whether as sexual activity (e.g., sex work, sexual violence, Sex Offences Act), demographic/biological categorization (e.g., sex ratio, sex differences), relationship categories (e.g., same-sex couples), or measurement/operationalization in research (e.g., sex assigned at birth vs. gender identity). Examples include studies of same-sex couple homogamy, UK policy on sex crimes, surveys of sex-based hygiene norms, or methodological notes on coding “sex” in census data. Compounds like “sexual,” “same-sex,” and technical usages such as “sex ratio” generally count, even if they are not about sexual behavior. By contrast, texts where “sex” appears only incidentally (author names, place names like “Essex,” a passing mention in a reference list, or non-English equivalents that don’t include the English token) are non-relevant to a literal keyword match. Edge cases include documents focused solely on “gender” without linking to sex, or items where “sex” appears only in metadata or acronyms; these are weaker matches than works whose central analysis hinges on sex.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks studies and datasets where sex is central—both as gender and as sexuality—including gender-disaggregated labor force and demographic tables and surveys on sexual behavior, AIDS, and LGBTI experiences. They appear to want sources primarily from Germany/Europe across historical periods (e.g., censuses, microcensuses, and FRA surveys).</desc>
	<narr>For the keyword “sex,” documents are relevant if they address sexual behavior, sexuality, or sexual health (e.g., surveys on attitudes to sexuality, AIDS-related condom use, number of sexual partners, group sex, homosexual contacts, or sex education), or if they use sex as an analytic demographic variable (e.g., employment rates, age structure, or labor force tables broken down by male/female). The provided text is highly relevant because large sections focus directly on sexual conduct and HIV prevention, while many datasets explicitly segment results “by sex” or “sex assigned at birth.” Documents are partially or marginally relevant when “sex” appears only incidentally in metadata (e.g., “sex of the interviewer”) or as a routine stratification in studies whose primary topic is unrelated to sexuality (such as economic statistics), unless sex-based analysis is central to the findings. Edge cases include content like “sex tourism” or “orientation to one’s own sex,” which still match sexual topics, and historical or labor datasets that merely list “by sex” in table headings without substantive discussion, which may be too thin for some intents behind the query. Non-relevant documents would be those where “sex” is an acronym or appears only as a stray label with no meaningful connection to gender or sexual behavior.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for the survey variable that records respondents' sex/gender — i.e., "Sex" or "Sex of respondent" — across multiple ISSP waves and dataset variable IDs. They want to identify where this variable appears (for example ZA1840, ZA3090, ZA4350, ZA5800, ZA6770, ZA7600, etc.) to locate or harmonize it for analysis.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "sex" when it clearly refers to a survey variable or field about respondents' sex/gender—for example lines that say "Sex of respondent," include variable names like "SEX V119" or codes such as "ZA5800" and survey identifiers like "ISSP 2011," which indicate a dataset variable rather than unrelated text. Concrete indicators of high relevance are question wording, variable IDs (v119, v296), dataset codes (ZA3090), and notes about how the variable is coded (male/female, missing codes). A document is non-relevant when "sex" appears only as noisy repetition, as part of other words or acronyms that are unrelated to respondent sex, or when the text discusses sexual activity or biology rather than a dataset variable. Edge cases include ambiguous uses where "Sex" could mean biological category versus sexual behavior, or when formatting/typos merge tokens (e.g., "SEXISSP")—in those cases you should check nearby context (survey name, variable code, question text) to decide relevance. Finally, brief lists of repeated tokens are lower quality matches even if they technically contain "SEX"; the most useful documents include descriptive metadata, coding schemes, or full question text.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is looking for how “sex” is defined and collected in German surveys, distinguishing biological sex from gender identity, and how this affects the identification and estimation of cohabiting unions (different-sex vs same-sex) in microcensus data. They also seek the related role of age, marital status, and cohabitation measures in survey analysis.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it uses “sex” as a socio-demographic variable (e.g., male/female/“diverse”) or classifies partnerships as same-sex vs different-sex, especially in survey, census, or statistical methodology contexts. Content that discusses how sex is recorded (biological sex vs sex according to civil registry), contrasts sex with gender identity, or explains procedures for identifying/co-estimating same-sex and different-sex cohabiting unions (such as in the German microcensus) is directly on-topic. By contrast, material where “sex” means sexual activity, sex education, or general discussions of age, marital status, or cohabitation without linking to sex categories would be non-relevant. Edge cases include documents that say “gender” but explicitly map it to biological/civil-status sex, mention third options like “diverse,” or use synonyms like “sex assigned at birth” (likely relevant), whereas incidental mentions of “same-sex” without any treatment of sex measurement or categorization may be borderline.</narr>

<title>rechts links</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is looking for research on the political meanings of “left” and “right” (links/rechts), how these concepts have evolved and are understood by different social groups, and how they function as heuristics for self- and party placement, especially in Germany. They seek survey-based analyses of associations, socio-structural influences, youth perceptions, and shifts in party positioning over time.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it examines the political meanings of “links” and “rechts” in German, such as the Left–Right schema, self-placement scales, party positioning, or how citizens and elites semantically associate these labels across time. Highly relevant examples include empirical studies (e.g., ALLBUS, GLES) that analyze open-ended associations with correspondence analysis, compare cohorts or regions (Ost/West), or show how education, age, and party bloc shape interpretations, as well as work testing the heuristic value of the Left–Right dimension or proposing added dimensions (libertarian–authoritarian, ecological). Methodological pieces on scale layout effects (left-to-right vs right-to-left) or cross-national comparisons of Left–Right meanings also fit. Non-relevant are texts that use “rechts” and “links” purely as spatial/anatomical terms (handedness, traffic directions) or that discuss legal “Recht” without any link to political right/left. Edge cases include symbolic treatments of right vs left hands that become relevant only if explicitly tied to political ideology, and analyses claiming politics is “beyond left and right” that still evaluate the schema’s role.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking information on the German left–right (links–rechts) political spectrum, including how people define “left” and “right,” self- and party placements on left–right scales, and related measures of voter behavior. They appear interested in survey datasets and studies (e.g., ALLBUS, GIP, panel studies) that operationalize and analyze left–right ideology.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly measures, defines, or analyzes the political left–right spectrum, often signaled by terms like Links-Rechts Einstufung, Selbsteinstufung, Links-Rechts Kontinuum, or Verständnisse der Begriffe links und rechts. Clear examples include surveys asking open-ended definitions of “links” and “rechts” (e.g., ALLBUS 2008 F029/F030), party and voter placements on left–right scales in the German Internet Panel, or coded manifestos and election studies that locate parties on a left–right axis. Historical or comparative studies that operationalize left–right (e.g., Weimar-era left–right dichotomies, Euromanifesto left–right codes) are also relevant even when embedded in broader topics like issue competence or value orientations. By contrast, documents that use rechts/links only as physical directions, legal “Recht,” or incidental mentions without ideological placement, or that list parties without left–right coding, are non-relevant. Edge cases that still count include half-scales, derived indices, or proxies (state intervention vs market, liberal–authoritarian) when they are tied back to a left–right placement; datasets with demographics or party preference alone, absent any left–right measure, are not.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The query seeks survey measures of political orientation asking respondents to place themselves on left–right scales (e.g., 0–10 or 1–11) or indicate if they are left or right. It also asks for comparative ratings of East vs. West Germans using bipolar adjective scales, marking how strongly opposing traits apply.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "rechts links" if it explicitly discusses the political left–right spectrum, especially in the form of survey items or self-placement scales using German terms like "links", "rechts", "Selbsteinstufung", "Einstufung", "Kontinuum" or "Skala". For example, questionnaires asking "Wo würden Sie sich auf einer Skala von 0 bis 10 einordnen?" or "Wenn Sie diese Skala von 1 bis 11 benutzen, wo würden Sie sich selbst einordnen?" are highly relevant because they frame left/right as ideological self-placement. Non-relevant documents include literal directional instructions ("turn left/right"), clinical descriptions of left/right body sides, files or code that only contain the tokens "links" or "rechts", or texts where "Rechts" refers to law or party names without ideological scale context. Edge cases to watch for are bilingual or ambiguous uses (e.g., "links" as hyperlinks or "Die Linke" as a party name), repeated boilerplate survey items (which indicate a questionnaire but may be low-quality or duplicated), and passages that mention the words without any political or survey context — these reduce usefulness even though they contain the keywords.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks information on measuring political orientation using a Left–Right scale in social surveys, including validated/pretested items and related measures of attitudes toward income inequality/redistribution and authoritarianism (e.g., B‑RWA‑6) used in German/European studies. They may also want guidance on standardized items for citizenship/work-permit variables and methodological approaches to poverty measurement with the German Microcensus.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it deals with the left–right political spectrum or its measurement, for example mentioning a Links–Rechts Skala, self-placement on a left/right scale, or related constructs like right-wing authoritarianism; this paragraph qualifies because it explicitly references a Links Rechts Skala and rechtsgerichtete autoritäre Einstellungen. It is also relevant when discussing attitudes (e.g., toward income redistribution) explicitly framed by left–right orientation. By contrast, texts that use Rechte to mean citizenship or legal rights, or use rechts as a physical direction or links as “hyperlinks,” are non-relevant even if the words appear. Edge cases include hyphenation and variants such as Links-Rechts, links/rechts, LR scale, English “left–right,” and compounds like rechtsgerichtet, which can be relevant if tied to political ideology; discussions of poverty measurement or survey methodology are only relevant if they anchor findings to left–right positioning.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks an overview of drug use and policy, especially concerning youth: psychosocial drivers, prevalence trends, and prevention approaches. They also want comparative insights into decriminalization/legalization and harm-reduction models, alongside organized crime and trafficking dynamics across different countries.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively discusses drugs (Drogen) as substances of use or misuse, including consumption patterns, health and social effects, trafficking, policy, prevention, or harm-reduction. Examples of relevance include analyses of youth drug use and school-based prevention, debates on legalization or decriminalization (e.g., Portugal, Germany), methadone or controlled heroin access, epidemiology of specific substances (cannabis, heroin, cocaine, Captagon), and organized crime or smuggling through ports. Texts using compound terms and synonyms like Drogenkonsum, Drogenpolitik, Rauschgift, Betäubungsmittel, Sucht/Suchtprävention, or naming specific substances (including comparisons with alcohol and tobacco) are also relevant. Non-relevant items include metaphorical uses (“wie eine Droge”), unrelated chemistry or biomedical terms that merely contain the string (e.g., Hydrogen, Androgen), or clinical pharmacology about approved medicines without a social/illicit-use context, as well as pieces where “Drogen” is only mentioned in passing. Edge cases are broader governance or historical essays: they count as relevant if drugs are a central analytic thread, but general youth or crime studies lacking substantive drug-focused content should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks survey-based information on drug use and attitudes—covering illegal drugs, alcohol, and tobacco—including prevalence, initiation age, contexts of use, perceived risks, access, prevention measures, and policy/testing opinions. It emphasizes youth and general populations in Germany and Europe, with detailed demographics and related topics such as AIDS awareness.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “drogen” if it substantively discusses drugs in the German sense—illegal and/or legal psychoactive substances—covering topics like consumption patterns, access and availability (e.g., within 24 hours), age of initiation, settings of use (schools, parties, clubs), health risks, prevention/education campaigns, legalization, or drug testing by police or employers. Content detailing specific substances (cannabis, heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamines), motives for use, consequences, or survey-based attitudes and demographics clearly qualifies. Material focused solely on alcohol and tobacco can still be relevant when treated as drugs in comparative health or policy contexts, or when included in broader drug behavior surveys. Non-relevant cases include texts where “drogen” means something else (e.g., Dutch “drogen” = to dry, retail “Drogerie”), or documents that only mention AIDS or other health topics without any drug-related link. Brief, passing mentions of drugs without substantive discussion would also be marginal or non-relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A person searching "drogen" here is likely looking for the survey instrument content about drugs — specifically questions on frequency of drug use in the past 12 months (e.g., hashish, marijuana, cocaine, heroin), attitudes toward decriminalizing possession of small amounts (including hard drugs), and the survey coding/listing where "Drogen" appears as a societal/political problem. They want the exact question wording, response options/codes, and how the topic is categorized among other public issues.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "drogen" if it directly discusses drugs—especially survey questions or metadata about drug use (for example the repeated question "Wie häufig haben Sie in den letzten 12 Monaten Drogen z.B. Haschisch, Marihuana, Kokain, Heroin … konsumiert"), attitudes toward decriminalization (e.g. F.85a asking whether possession of small amounts should be punished), or coding entries like "58. Drogen" and related variable names (v33001, V207, F.2). Concrete evidence of relevance includes lists of specific substances, frequency-response options, question IDs or codebook entries that map responses to "Drogen", and policy/attitude items about hard drugs. A document is non-relevant if it merely contains the substring "drogen" in passing among many unrelated topics, discusses pharmaceutical drugs in a clinical dosing context without reference to substance use or policy, or only has noisy/duplicated text that obscures any substantive drug-related content. Edge cases to watch for are synonyms and language variants (English "drugs", "narcotics", or German OCR errors that split or misspell "Drogen"), survey fragments that only list "Drogen" as one item among many (lower relevance unless accompanied by questions or codes), and documents that mention drug-related codes (v33001, F.85a) — these are often highly relevant even if the human-readable question is truncated. A practical heuristic: prioritize documents containing explicit drug-use questions, listed substances, or decriminalization/attitude items and treat brief or ambiguous mentions as lower relevance unless corroborated by codes or full question text.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant for the keyword "drogen" when it directly discusses drugs or substance use (e.g., Rauschmittel, Sucht, Abhängigkeit), drug‑related offenses, treatment for substance use disorders, or instruments that measure drug‑related behaviors and treatment motivation. For example, the paragraph mentions "Rauschmitteldelikte" (drug offenses), treatment motivation for dependence, and barriers to smoking‑cessation aids, so those passages would be relevant. A document that only treats general juvenile delinquency (theft, vandalism, violence) without any reference to substances would be non‑relevant, as would texts that merely use the word "drugs" metaphorically or in an unrelated context. Edge cases include materials about nicotine/tobacco cessation (may be relevant if the searcher intends "drogen" broadly), questionnaires that include a single drug‑related item among many non‑drug items (partially relevant), and documents in a different language or using only distant synonyms.</narr>

<title>rechtsextremismus</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking an overview of right-wing extremism, including its definition and ideology, manifestations (parties, movements, youth scenes, media), and social drivers and electoral support in German-speaking contexts. They also want research-based responses and prevention strategies across education, policy, law enforcement, and civil society.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly examines Rechtsextremismus as an ideology or phenomenon—e.g., defining it as anti-egalitarian, authoritarian, and anti-pluralist—and analyzes its actors, structures, and expressions. Strong signals include discussion of right-wing extremist parties and milieus (such as NPD, DVU, FPÖ), youth subcultures (skinheads, hooligans), media/music/Internet ecosystems, electoral dynamics, violent manifestations or right-wing terrorism, and psychological, social, or political explanations of causes and attitudes. Policy and pedagogy materials are also relevant when they focus on combating or framing Rechtsextremismus (government committees, mobile counseling, school curricula, local case studies, civil society strategies). Non-relevant items are those treating “extremism” or “racism” in general without a right-wing link, purely historical accounts of National Socialism without connection to contemporary right-wing extremism, or texts that only mention the term in passing; similarly, work on left-wing extremism or generic populism is irrelevant unless tied to right-wing extremist content. Edge cases include analyses of right-wing populism, “extremism of the center,” public discourse, or legal/administrative measures, which are relevant only if they explicitly connect to right-wing extremist ideas, networks, or outcomes rather than using the concept metaphorically or tangentially.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks empirical, survey-based information on right-wing extremism in Germany—especially Thuringia—including its definitions, attitude scales, and trend data. They want datasets, variables, and methodology from studies like the Thüringen Monitor, ALLBUS, and SOCRIS, and how such attitudes relate to democracy, migration, and socio-economic change.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly examines right‑wing extremism (Rechtsextremismus) as a phenomenon or as a measured attitude, for example through definitions, item batteries, scales, trends, or analyses of groups, parties, and societal responses. Clear positives include survey programs like the Thüringen Monitor or ALLBUS that operationalize Rechtsextremismus via items on xenophobia, nationalism, chauvinism, social Darwinism, antisemitism, relativization of National Socialism, and support for a right‑wing dictatorship, or studies of local acceptance, policing, NPD evaluations, and crisis effects on far‑right support. Methodological details (sampling, weighting, variable lists) remain relevant when they specify what and how Rechtsextremismus is measured and reported over time or by region. Documents are non‑relevant if they only mention the term in passing among many topics without substantive content, or if they focus on unrelated politics/economics or other forms of extremism without linking to right‑wing extremism. Edge cases include media content analyses that code “Rechtsextremismus” as a category (relevant if coding rules and findings are described), discussions of right‑wing populism (relevant when explicitly tied to extremist attitudes or organizations), and historical Nazi references (relevant when used as measurement items like “Verharmlosung des Nationalsozialismus,” but not when purely historical without an extremism focus).</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for information about right‑wing extremism in Germany — specifically public attitudes, media coverage, perceived threat to democracy, whether enough political and legal action is taken (laws against right‑wing extremism), and survey data (e.g., ZA5573 2008) about these perceptions, including concerns about right‑wing views in the police.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "rechtsextremismus" when it explicitly addresses Rechtsextremismus or close variants (e.g., rechtsextreme, Rechtsextreme), discusses legal measures, media coverage, surveys or public opinion (for example the ZA5573 2008 survey items or legislative tags like V199/V186), or treats police involvement and threats to democracy in the context of right‑wing extremism. It is non‑relevant when the word is absent or only generic terms like "extremism" are used without a right‑wing qualifier, when "right" appears in a non‑political sense, or when a file contains only administrative codes, repeated headers or metadata with no substantive content. Edge cases include documents in German with morphological variants or compound words (e.g., rechtsextremes Gedankengut) and translations — these should be matched by stem or synonym lookup because they are often highly relevant. Repeated survey text or media mentions can create noise: repeated headers or duplicated lines are less useful by themselves but still relevant if they contain actual survey questions or analysis. Finally, broad anti‑extremism policy pieces are borderline: they are relevant if they specifically address measures against right‑wing groups, but less so if they only discuss extremism in general without reference to the right‑wing dimension.</narr>

	<desc>The user is looking for a concise overview of "rechtsextremismus" (right-wing extremism), including its defining beliefs, typical behaviors and symbols. They also want information on associated groups, legal status, societal risks, and prevention or countermeasures.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "rechtsextremismus" if it directly addresses right‑wing extremism — its ideology, organizations, incidents, historical development, legal definitions, counter‑extremism policies, research studies, or detailed news reporting — especially when the term or close synonyms (e.g., rechtsextrem, right‑wing extremism) appear in the title or body. Examples of relevant items are government reports on neo‑Nazi groups, academic analyses of recruitment tactics, school curricula about radicalization, and court decisions applying statutes against extremist activity. Non‑relevant documents include those that only mention the word in passing, discuss "extremism" generically without a right‑wing focus, cover mainstream conservative politics (right‑of‑center but non‑extremist), or use similar words in unrelated senses (e.g., rechts meaning “right” direction or legal "Recht"). Edge cases include materials that are topically relevant but problematic — such as propaganda, recruitment pages, or SEO‑stuffed content — which are still relevant to the query but require careful handling; also related terms like rechtspopulismus or translations into English may overlap with but not exactly match "rechtsextremismus."</narr>

<title>left right</title>
<publication>
	<desc>Find research on the left–right ideological scale in comparative politics, focusing on how its meaning varies across countries and respondents, its measurement validity, and its role in structuring policy preferences and voting. Emphasis on cross-national equivalence, dimensionality, and changing salience in party competition and public opinion.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it analyzes the political left–right dimension, such as studies of left–right self-placement scales, construct equivalence across countries, voter or party positioning, or how income/education or policy preferences map onto “left” versus “right.” Content using close variants like “left–right,” “LR scale,” “ideological spectrum,” or explicit liberal–conservative mappings also counts, as do pieces on salience, validity, nonresponse to left–right probes, or cross-national comparability (e.g., whether the meaning of left/right differs in Japan vs. Scandinavia). It is non-relevant when “left” and “right” refer to spatial or anatomical directions, formatting/alignment, physics or biology (chirality), or any non-political usage, or when the terms appear only in passing without analyzing the ideological divide. Borderline cases include papers focused solely on “left populism” or “right populism” without situating them along a left–right axis, or work on “liberal–conservative” that lacks an explicit mapping to left–right; these are relevant only if they connect to the left–right schema. Methodological pieces evaluating the dimensionality or complexity of left–right perceptions, party shifts on economic vs cultural subdimensions, or variations in salience across contexts are strongly relevant even if the exact phrase “left right” is hyphenated or abbreviated.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks datasets and survey measures capturing left–right political orientation, including self- and party placement on left–right scales and open-ended associations with “left” and “right,” alongside related attitudes (e.g., extremism, democracy, asylum). The focus is on German and European studies such as ALLBUS 2008, GIP, ICCP, and Euromanifesto data.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “left right” when it uses the terms to denote the political spectrum, for example through self-placement or party placement on a left–right scale or continuum, coding of manifestos by left–right position, or analysis of left- and right-wing extremism. The provided paragraph is highly relevant because it repeatedly references left–right scales, open-ended associations with “left” and “right,” votes by left–right polarity, and survey modules that classify parties and respondents on a left–right continuum (e.g., ALLBUS, GIP, Euromanifesto, and historical voting studies). Documents are non-relevant when “right” means a legal entitlement (e.g., “right to asylum”) or when “left/right” indicates physical direction or layout, without any link to ideological positioning. Edge cases arise when both senses appear; signals such as “scale,” “continuum,” “placement,” “wing,” “polarity,” or “extremism” should tip the judgment toward relevance. Variants like “left-right,” “left wing/right wing,” or synonymous ideological labels (e.g., liberal/conservative) also support relevance.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>Identify survey variables that measure left–right ideological placement—both respondent self-placement and placements of parties and leaders—on 0–10 (or 1–10) scales, including harmonised and recoded/derived versions for comparing respondent and party/leader positions.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "left right" when it discusses the political left–right spectrum or its measurement — for example survey questions or codebook entries that ask respondents to place themselves, parties, or leaders on a 0–10 or 1–10 left–right scale (e.g. V76 Left Right Selfplacement, v241/v242 harmonised or recoded variables, PARTY LR, or items asking about PARTY A or LEADER A). It is non-relevant when "left" and "right" are used as literal directions, handedness, UI layout or other non-political contexts, or when the terms appear only as unrelated field names with no scale or ideological context. Edge cases include snippets that contain variable names like "LEFT RIGHT PLACEMENT HARMONISED" but no question text — these are likely relevant if they are part of a survey codebook or recode documentation, but ambiguous if isolated. Repetition of recode/harmonised labels, explicit scale wording ("where would you place yourself on a scale from 0 to 10") and references to parties or leaders are strong signals of relevance; absence of those cues reduces relevance.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user likely wants information on the Left–Right political self-placement scale, explaining how it measures ideological orientation and how it is used in social and political surveys (e.g., Germany’s ALLBUS).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant when it uses “left right” to denote the political ideology spectrum or measurement instruments that place individuals along that axis (e.g., the Left Right Self Placement scale, Right-Wing Authoritarianism measures, B-RWA). This passage is relevant because it explicitly names the Left Right Self Placement scale and discusses right-wing authoritarianism and related attitudinal scales that map onto the left–right dimension. Mentions of “right” as civil or legal rights (right to vote, freedom to travel) or “left” as a verb (“left blank”) are non-relevant uses despite matching the keywords. Edge cases include hyphenated or abbreviated forms (left-right, L–R) and synonyms like liberal–conservative; texts focusing only on “right-wing” can still be relevant if they anchor it on the left–right spectrum. Conversely, content about digital behavioral data ethics is non-relevant unless it explicitly links to political left–right positioning.</narr>

<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks research and policy insights on working time (Arbeitszeit) in Germany, including how normal, actual, and desired hours are measured and organized, the role of flexible schedules and collective agreements, and differences across groups. They want to understand impacts on job satisfaction, gender and family balance, and firm-level practices and outcomes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it centers on Arbeitszeit (working time) as a primary concept—e.g., analyzing its duration, measurement (normal, actual, desired hours), flexibility (shift schedules, time accounts, part-time), or its effects on satisfaction, family-work balance, or labor outcomes. Concrete examples include studies using time-use diaries to compare actual vs. normal hours, research on tariff or firm-level regulations that lengthen or shorten weekly hours, or analyses of fathers’ and mothers’ desired hours and the gap to contracted hours. Content focused on adjacent constructs like Betriebszeiten (operating hours), overtime, or flexible scheduling remains relevant when explicitly tied to individual working time levels or compliance with contracted hours. Non-relevant items are those that only mention Arbeitszeit in passing, discuss labor markets or wages without addressing hours, or focus solely on unrelated “time” (e.g., machine runtime or school schedules). Edge cases include methods-heavy papers (e.g., Tobit/Heckman/Double Hurdle) that are still relevant if Arbeitszeit is a dependent or key variable, and policy debates that are pertinent only when they substantively address changes to working hours rather than generic productivity or cost arguments.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks historical and statistical information on working time in Germany, including datasets and studies on effective hours, sectoral trends since the 19th century, and the role of unions and policy. They also want survey evidence on schedules, overtime, shift work, and preferences regarding work-time regulation and reduction.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “arbeitszeit” if it substantively treats working time—defining and measuring it (for example, distinguishing nominal vs. effective hours), tracing its historical development (e.g., Meinert’s and Schröder’s estimates for German industry, the 8‑hour day, postwar 48→40 hours), or analyzing concrete scheduling features such as weekly hours, overtime, shift/night/weekend work, core time and flexitime, and tariff or statutory regulations. Material that provides data tables or survey results focused on hours worked (Mikrozensus actual hours vs. enterprise-based paid hours), sectoral differences (textile, metal, mining, construction), or worker preferences for shorter/longer weeks is clearly relevant. Documents become only marginally relevant when “Arbeitszeit” appears as one of many background variables in broader studies (e.g., time-budget diaries or lifestyle surveys listing weekend or partner’s hours) or when the focus is another topic (like European currency or general political attitudes) with just a single item on flexible hours. Edge cases include occupationally narrow studies (e.g., nurses’ shift blocks or farmers’ seasonal hours) which are relevant if they report actual working-time patterns, and references that mention “Arbeitszeit” only in metadata or lists without analysis, which are typically non-relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for information about working hours (Arbeitszeit): who sets schedules and whether employees can choose start/end times, use flexible hours or time accounts, overtime rules, reducing hours before retirement, and how these issues feature in collective bargaining (e.g., metal/electrical industry and public-sector disputes).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "arbeitszeit" when it substantively discusses working time issues — for example reduction or increase of hours, overtime, flexible/gleitende Arbeitszeit, Arbeitszeitkonten, who sets start and end times, or collective-bargaining disputes about hours. Strongly relevant passages are full sentences like survey questions about reducing hours before retirement, whether the employer fixes schedules, records of hours worked beyond contract, or debates in the metal/electrical industry over shorter or longer workweeks. A document is less relevant if "arbeitszeit" appears only as an administrative code, repeated token, or header (e.g., V241 ARBEITSZEIT LOHNAUSGLEICH) with no explanatory text, or if it occurs incidentally in a list of topics without substantive content. Edge cases include OCR/encoding artifacts (e.g., "uuml ber" for "über"), concatenated or abbreviated forms ("ARBEITSZEITVERK."), or mentions in a non-labor context (machine uptime vs. employee hours) — these should be considered relevant only if surrounding context clearly matches the labor-related sense.</narr>

They want details on the survey questions/modules and pretest methods used to measure these concepts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “arbeitszeit” if it directly addresses working time—such as weekly hours, desired or actual hours, overtime, shift schedules, part‑time/full‑time status, or work–life balance—and clearly ties these to employment or family contexts. Survey descriptions and pretests that explicitly include questions on Arbeitszeit (e.g., desired weekly working time, employer attachment, or women’s working hours on farms) are relevant even if much of the text focuses on methodology like cognitive interviews. Documents are only marginally relevant if “Arbeitszeit” appears in a long list of topics without substantive discussion, or if it’s mentioned solely in metadata, footnotes, or project titles. Non‑relevant cases include texts about unrelated themes (e.g., agricultural policy or demographics) that never discuss work hours, or pieces where “Arbeitszeit” is present only as a homonym or in an unrelated compound. Edge cases include documents using synonyms or other languages (e.g., “working time,” “hours worked”), numeric hours without the keyword, or legal references to Arbeitszeit that don’t provide content beyond a citation.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly discusses “rightwing/right-wing/right wing” politics—actors, parties, voters, ideologies, rhetoric, media, or movements—such as analyses of rightwing populism, rightwing extremism, electoral advantages for rightwing parties, or voter trust and participation patterns by rightwing identification. Examples include studies of civil resistance to rightwing populism, event-study evidence on Germany’s AfD, comparisons of rightwing populists versus technocratic leaders, or research on strategic voting that advantages rightwing parties in rural districts. It is non-relevant if “right wing” is used in a non-political sense (sports positions, aircraft wings, anatomy) or if the term appears only in passing without substantive treatment. Edge cases include documents using close synonyms (conservative, far-right) without the exact keyword, which may be topically relevant but not a strict keyword match, and hyphenation or spacing variants that should still count. Historical pieces on fascism are relevant when they directly link to rightwing rhetoric or populism; otherwise they may be peripheral.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>Seeking datasets and documentation on right‑wing politics and extremism — including party positions and Euroscepticism in EU elections, replication files and code, and a record of right‑wing extremist demonstrations in Germany (2005–2020). Also looking for survey variables and scales measuring right‑wing attitudes (e.g., Right‑Wing Authoritarianism, social dominance, xenophobia, antisemitism) and metadata from projects like EU Profiler, EUandI, ThüringenMonitor, ICCP and GESIS.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "rightwing" when its primary content concerns right‑wing actors, ideologies, attitudes, or events — for example studies of right‑wing Eurosceptic parties in the European Parliament, datasets on right‑wing extremist demonstrations (the paragraph’s 3,290‑observation German demonstrations file is a direct hit), or surveys that include Right‑Wing Authoritarianism, xenophobia, AfD support, or related scales. The EP replication files that document greater coherence among right‑wing Eurosceptics and the ThüringenMonitor measures of right‑extremist attitudes are clearly relevant because they center on right‑wing politics and behaviors. By contrast, materials that only incidentally record a left–right self‑placement item or that focus on general demographics, EU procedures, or unrelated topics without substantive analysis of right‑wing phenomena are non‑relevant or only marginally relevant. Edge cases include texts that use “right” in a directional or non‑political sense, documents in other languages using terms like rechtsradikal/rechtsextrem, or studies of conservative policy positions that are relevant to some searches but less so for queries specifically about right‑wing extremism.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants a concise paragraph defining "rightwing" — a political label for conservative or reactionary positions that typically favor limited government, free-market economics, traditional social and cultural values, strong national defense, and law-and-order policies. They likely expect a clear summary of core beliefs and how right-wing views contrast with left-wing positions.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "rightwing" if its primary focus is on right-wing politics or ideology—discussing conservative, nationalist, libertarian, or far‑right movements, party platforms, typical policy positions (e.g., immigration restriction, free‑market advocacy), historical development, or profiles of right‑wing leaders and organizations. Useful examples include analyses of a country's right‑wing party, academic papers comparing right‑wing policy trends, news reports about right‑wing rallies, or datasets showing voting patterns among right‑wing constituencies. Non‑relevant documents treat the term in a different sense (e.g., describing the right wing of a building or aircraft), use it only in passing without substantive content, are spam, or contain unrelated homographs or usernames that happen to include the word. Edge cases include phrases like "the right wing of the party" (which may be relevant if it discusses intra‑party ideology), differences in what counts as right‑wing across countries, and pieces that merely quote right‑wing rhetoric without analysis—these can be borderline relevant depending on depth and intent.</narr>

They would want the scale's origin (Altemeyer 1981), the three subdimensions it measures (authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, and conventionalism), and information about validity and application in population surveys.</desc>
	<narr>This document is relevant to the keyword "rightwing" when the intent is academic or psychological: it describes the BRWA6 balanced short scale for measuring Right‑Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) used in the Austrian National Election Study and explicitly references Altemeyer’s three subdimensions (authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, and conventionalism). It contains operational details (semantically opposed items, scale purpose, target population) and theoretical grounding useful for someone looking for measurement instruments, survey items, or psychometric validation related to right‑wing authoritarian attitudes. It is non‑relevant if the user is searching for news, party platforms, policy positions, or contemporary political movements labeled “right‑wing,” since this text focuses on scale construction and theory rather than political activity or ideology in the broader sense. Edge cases: the paragraph is in German, so it may be less useful to an English‑language searcher, and the term “rightwing” can also refer to unrelated contexts (sports, anatomy, or general conservative politics), where this methodological document would not match intent.</narr>

The focus spans multiple sectors (tourism, higher education, finance, corporate culture, and law), with emphasis on European contexts and alignment with the UN SDGs.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it engages substantively with sustainability as a concept or practice across environmental, social, economic, or institutional pillars, including policy frameworks, governance, indicators/metrics, and behavior change. Examples of relevance include analyses of Agenda 21 or the SDGs, sectoral studies such as sustainable tourism using Eurobarometer data, university sustainability strategies, sustainability communication on social media, sustainable finance, or methods like ISO 37130, indicator selection, and balanced scorecards applied to sustainability performance. Work that treats the normative and analytical dimensions (e.g., Brundtland, social sustainability, intercultural understanding, or legal implementation of sustainability) is also relevant. Non-relevant items are those that only mention “sustainability” in passing, use the term in an unrelated sense (e.g., “sustainable competitive advantage” or mere financial viability) without environmental/social context, or discuss tourism/education/finance without any sustainability framing. Edge cases such as single-pillar studies, methodological pieces building sustainability indices or clusters, and critiques of governance or greenwashing remain relevant; duplicated content does not change relevance but may be down-weighted for redundancy.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks datasets and surveys that measure sustainability—especially SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and production—including public awareness, attitudes, and behaviors in Germany. They also want broader European social indicator time series and historical agricultural data relevant to sustainability assessment.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “sustainability” when it explicitly examines sustainability concepts, targets, behaviors, or metrics—for example, surveys on SDG 12 awareness and sustainable consumption, youth studies on environment and climate engagement, or indicator frameworks like the European System of Social Indicators that include a sustainability domain with time series. It is non-relevant when “sustainability” appears only as a passing topic in a broad list (e.g., COVID-19 information surveys that merely include “sustainability” among many interests) or is used in a different sense, such as durability/long-term impact (World Youth Day “impact and sustainability”) or fiscal viability (the “sustainability of the pension system” in euro-related attitudes). Edge cases include agricultural historical time series: these can be relevant if they enable analysis of resource use, yields, and inputs (e.g., fertilizers) tied to sustainable production, but are less relevant if presented solely as production trends without a sustainability framing. Repeated methodological details (CATI, dual-frame sampling) do not by themselves confer relevance unless they support substantive sustainability findings. Duplicate descriptions of the same indicator system add little new value despite using the sustainability label.</narr>

It also seeks to assess awareness of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and views on how the EU should ensure its imports are sustainable (mandatory requirements, trade policy leverage, or responsibility of exporting countries).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "sustainability" when it explicitly discusses sustainable concepts, policies, or indicators — for example references to sustainable growth, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), environmentally friendly production, or measures to ensure EU imports come from sustainable sources. Items that name specific policy options (supporting sustainable agriculture, obliging exporters to meet sustainability requirements, applying global trade policies, reinforcing consumer rights or investing in green ICT) are clearly relevant because they address practical routes to sustainability. A document is non‑relevant if it only contains unrelated material or purely technical metadata — for instance long runs of repeated question codes or prompts with no substantive content about sustainability. Borderline cases include survey transcripts or lists of response labels that mention "sustainable" only as a tag: these are useful for detecting topic presence but provide limited insight for policy or conceptual analysis. Finally, passages that use "sustainable growth" in a narrow economic sense (e.g., only promoting high‑speed internet or enterprise creation) are partially relevant but may miss environmental or social dimensions of sustainability.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “sustainability” when it directly addresses sustainable development concepts, metrics, or practices, such as frameworks for measuring sustainability beliefs or modeling sustainability-related scenarios. This paragraph is partially relevant because it includes scales tied to sustainable development (e.g., beliefs about mathematics for sustainability and projects modeling speed limits, heat pumps, and electric cars) and introduces a “distant future” temporal focus explicitly positioned as relevant to sustainability research. However, large portions focus on mobile data collection infrastructure and an interview about app-based research methods, which are only tangential unless clearly linked to sustainability outcomes. Mentions of “sustainable” as in “stable, sustainable software” or the “Secure Flourish Index” using “sustain” to mean maintaining well-being are edge cases that match the keyword but do not reflect the sustainability domain. Documents that only use “sustain” in a durability or generic sense would be non-relevant, while those operationalizing sustainability constructs (e.g., validated scales for sustainable development beliefs or distant-future orientation) should rank higher.</narr>

They likely want evidence-based assessment methods and practical interventions at individual and organizational levels to prevent and manage job stress.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it discusses stress specifically in the context of work or employment, including occupational stress models, workplace conditions, organizational factors, labor policy, or occupational health (e.g., psychische Arbeitsbelastungen, Arbeitsschutzgesetz, Arbeitsorganisation, Entgrenzte Arbeit). Mentions of stress within the Arbeitswelt, specific professions (e.g., Sozialarbeit, IT sector), unions and workplace negotiations (e.g., IG Metall anti-stress measures), or emotions at work are strong signals, and compounds like Arbeitsstress, Arbeitsbelastung, or Arbeitswelt, as well as the old spelling Streß, should count. By contrast, texts focusing on stress in families, partnerships, or among students, or medical discussions of stress and heart disease without a workplace link, are non-relevant, as are uses of Arbeit meaning “study/paper” rather than employment. Edge cases include sociology or history pieces that connect organizational and task-related stress or analyze work culture; these are relevant even if “work” appears mainly in compounds or institutions. A document that mentions both terms only incidentally or far apart, with no substantive connection between stress and employment, should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking information on work-related stress, including its causes (e.g., workload, time pressure, long hours, job insecurity), prevalence, and health and well-being impacts. They may also want evidence and survey data on how employers assess and manage psychosocial risks and what measures help reduce workplace stress.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “stress arbeit” when it addresses work-related stress, psychosocial risks, or the conditions that generate stress at work, including measurement, causes, consequences, and management. Clear signals include explicit terms like arbeitsbedingter Stress, Arbeitsbedingungen, Arbeitsbelastung, Zeitdruck, Überstunden, Arbeitsdruck, psychosoziale Risiken, and scales of Stress, as in the ESENER surveys and sections that gauge stress, time pressure, and workload or discuss employer measures to handle stress, bullying, and violence. Content linking stress to overtime, job insecurity, unemployment, work–life boundaries, commuting, or organizational changes is also relevant. By contrast, texts that discuss stress unrelated to employment (e.g., medical or exam stress) or discuss Arbeit without any stress dimension (e.g., EU constitution, pensions, or ICT use without mentioning stress) are non-relevant. Edge cases include generic health “stress” items not tied to work, uses of “Stress” in other senses (e.g., stress tests, material stress), or references to “Arbeit” as schoolwork or a thesis; methodological descriptions remain relevant if they center on managing or measuring work-related stress.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for survey items and variables measuring work-related stress and related job characteristics — e.g., frequency of feeling stressed, changes in stress over time, time pressure, overall job satisfaction, willingness to keep working, responsibility for other employees, workplace location/sector/type, and other employment conditions. They likely want these items to analyze workplace stress and its correlates.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "stress arbeit" if it explicitly addresses stress at work — for example survey items asking whether respondents feel "oft/manchmal/selten/nie im Stress," whether stress has increased or decreased over the years, or how often people work under time pressure. Clear matches include German question text like "Wenn Sie einmal an Ihre tägliche Arbeit denken: fühlen Sie sich dabei oft, manchmal, selten oder nie im Stress?" or items measuring frequency of working under time pressure. Documents are non-relevant when they focus on unrelated topics that happen to appear in the same corpus (e.g., party politics, country of work, public vs. private sector comparisons, or reasons for part‑time work) unless those sections explicitly tie back to workplace stress. Edge cases: a text that mentions "stress" in a different sense (mechanical/physiological stress) or uses only metadata variable names (V99, Q16) without the actual stress question is not relevant; conversely, documents that do not use the word "stress" but measure time pressure or job strain can be partially relevant as proxies. Duplicate survey blocks or repeated wording count as relevant if they include the stress items, but mere lists of variable names without content should be considered non‑relevant.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking an overview of validated (mostly German-language) psychometric instruments to assess work-related stress/irritation and related psychosocial constructs (e.g., curiosity, responsibility attributions, procrastination, sensation seeking, job characteristics, personal norms, health anxiety, mood, aggression, and job satisfaction). They want brief descriptions, theoretical bases, and psychometric evidence to select appropriate measures for research or assessment.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it addresses stress in the context of work (e.g., occupational stress, psychische Belastung bei der Arbeit, Burnout, Irritation) or uses models/measures explicitly tied to workplace strain, such as Lazarus’s transactional stress model applied to job contexts. Examples of relevant content here include the “Irritation” questionnaire conceptualized between mental fatigue and illness in work settings and scales on perceived job characteristics (e.g., psychological job demands) or job-related attitudes when they link to stress experiences. Documents are non-relevant if they discuss “stress” only as a general trait or tolerance without a work context (e.g., the 5DCR “Stress Tolerance” facet), or focus on unrelated constructs like ecological responsibility, sensation seeking, need to evaluate, or general health anxiety and aggression with no occupational tie-in. Edge cases include procrastination, mood, anomie, or general job satisfaction: these become relevant only when analyzed as causes, correlates, or outcomes of work stress. German-language instruments or German samples enhance relevance only if the content centers on stress at work; otherwise, mere mention of “stress” or “Arbeit” without linkage to occupational stress is insufficient.</narr>

<title>social status</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks a synthesis of research on social status—especially subjective status—covering how it is defined and measured and the key determinants (education, occupation, income, mobility, inequality) across countries. They want to understand how status perceptions influence identity, political attitudes and behavior, media and cultural consumption, and outcomes like job satisfaction.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly treats social status as a position in a social hierarchy—either subjective (e.g., ladder self-placement) or objective/proxy-based (education, occupation, income, prestige scales like EGP/ISEI/CAMSIS)—and examines its determinants, patterns, or consequences. Examples include ISSP-based analyses of subjective social status across countries and time, experiments that manipulate group status independent of power, studies of status inconsistency and mobility, links between perceived inequality/fairness and status, or domain-specific cases (e.g., aviation maintenance, migrant identities, media portrayals, leisure stratification) where status is central to the argument. Works that develop or harmonize measurement of occupation/prestige as indicators of status, or that trace how status shapes politics, identity, or well-being, also qualify. Non-relevant items use “status” in non-social senses (project/health/marital/device status) or discuss power/inequality without engaging status, prestige, or hierarchical placement. Edge cases: papers that decouple power from status to isolate status effects are relevant; pieces that only name-drop “status” without operationalizing or analyzing it are borderline.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks social science data and surveys on social status and mobility—especially comparisons of respondents’ and parents’ occupational status, self-classification of class, and related demographics. They want variables linking status to political behavior, memberships, religiosity, education, urbanization, and social networks to analyze determinants and consequences of social stratification across populations.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly measures or analyzes social status/class, stratification, prestige, or mobility—such as self-assessed social class, interviewer-rated class, assessment of social rank, or comparisons of a respondent’s occupational status with their father’s (intergenerational mobility). Clear positives here include topics like “self assessment of social class,” “assessment of the social prestige of various occupations,” “interviewer rating social class of respondent,” “social mobility,” and “occupational status of respondent in comparison to father status.” Content that lists demographics (age, sex, marital status), memberships, or political attitudes is relevant only when these are used to classify or explain social class/stratification; otherwise, they are peripheral. Edge cases include uses of “status” that are not about social hierarchy—e.g., marital status, employment status, or geopolitical “status of Bosnia and Herzegovina” and “status of Serbs”—which are non-relevant, whereas “occupational status” is relevant if treated as a proxy for social standing. Surveys on social networks or community support are relevant when they contain self-classification or interviewer class ratings; if they only describe contacts or leisure without class/prestige measures, they are not.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>Looking for definitions and survey measures that capture an individual's social status in demographic data. This includes variables for occupation and current employment, marital status, household role (head or spouse/partner), and broader socioeconomic position.</desc>
	<narr>Relevant documents are those that explicitly define, list, or measure indicators of social status — for example occupation/occupation status, current employment status, socio‑economic status, marital status, head‑of‑household or main source of living — such as survey questionnaires, dataset codebooks, or research that uses variables like V133, V125, Q110a, etc. A paragraph like the one above, which enumerates variable names and labels for occupation, marital and household roles, is a good match because it clearly maps the constructs used to capture social status. Non‑relevant documents would be those that use the word “status” in a different sense (system status, health status, order status) or only contain isolated repetitions of the token “status” without contextual definitions or measures. Edge cases include files that mention one indicator (only marital status or only employment) — these can be relevant if the user accepts single‑indicator measures — and ambiguous variable labels (e.g., MAINSTAT, SPMAINST) that require metadata checking to confirm they refer to social status.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks guidance on how to conceptualize and measure social status in survey research, emphasizing occupational classification and indices (e.g., ISCO-coded ISEI, ESeC) alongside related demographic measures like main status vs. employment, marital/cohabitation, and sex/gender. They need advice on questionnaire standardization, coding procedures, and evidence of reliability/validity for comparative analyses.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it treats social status as a position in the stratification system or socioeconomic hierarchy and explains how it is measured or transmitted, for example via ISEI, SIOPS, ESeC/EGP class schemes, or theories of intergenerational status inheritance. Highly relevant examples include guides to coding occupations to ISCO-08 for constructing ISEI, descriptions of class classification using employment relations, or studies showing how status position shapes attitudes toward education or motives for status maintenance. Variables that structure or proxy social status—such as main activity status (e.g., student, unemployed), employment status, and cultural capital (e.g., number of books)—are relevant when linked to socioeconomic resources or prestige; marital status/cohabitation are relevant only insofar as they are analyzed as components of or pathways to socioeconomic positioning. Non-relevant are items that use “status” in a purely legal or administrative sense (marital or civil status, “status quo”), or instruments unrelated to stratification (grit, speak-up behavior, survey incentives), unless they explicitly connect to social status outcomes. Edge cases include sex/gender measurement debates and justice-evaluation scales: they are only relevant if tied to patterns of social stratification or perceived inequality; likewise, technical discussions of occupational coding are relevant when they enable status indices, but not when they are purely about software or workflow.</narr>

<title>social mobility</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks a concise, research-based overview of social mobility: how it is defined and measured (objective vs. subjective), its intergenerational patterns and determinants (education policy, skills, social capital), and its interaction with spatial/international migration. They also want evidence on consequences for health, life satisfaction, and political attitudes, with comparative cross-national findings.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it examines social mobility as movement between social strata across generations or over the life course, including its determinants, consequences, or measurement. This includes empirical studies using class mobility models (e.g., diagonal reference models), percentile-based occupational status measures net of upgrading, analyses of subjective versus objective mobility and their links to health, life satisfaction, or political attitudes, and work that connects spatial/international migration to social positions through concepts like transnationalism, social capital, or intersectionality. Policy evaluations that affect status attainment (such as compulsory schooling reforms) and studies of academic or student mobility are relevant when they explicitly assess status gains or losses or inequality of opportunity. Non-relevant are pieces where “mobility” means political mobilization on social media, transport/sustainable mobility, or physical movement, unless they directly measure changes in social class or status. Edge cases include international student/researcher mobility or social capital studies—these are only relevant if they theorize or measure shifts in social position; null results on mobility effects remain relevant, while purely technical discussions without a clear link to social stratification may be marginal.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks information on social mobility—how people move between social positions across and within generations—and how it is measured. They want studies and datasets (primarily from Germany, with some U.S. context) on occupational, sectoral, and regional mobility and their links to education, class origin, and demographics.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it examines movement between social strata—typically intergenerational (parent-to-child) or intragenerational (career) mobility—using concrete indicators such as parental occupation/education, respondent occupation, income, prestige scores, or explicit mobility matrices across cohorts. Examples of high relevance include surveys comparing the occupational positions of fathers and respondents (e.g., 1955/1965/1970 panels), status-attainment studies using Siegel prestige scores, or community studies that explicitly code inter- and intragenerational mobility alongside social origins and education. Documents are non-relevant when “mobility” refers only to physical/geographic movement, telecommunications, or technology (e.g., 5G rollouts, mobile phone usage, passive mobile data collection) or when they focus on pensions/politics without measuring class or occupational movement. Edge cases include sectoral or regional mobility studies that are relevant only if they link moves across industries or regions to changes in status/class; likewise, surveys capturing perceived chances of upward mobility or expected occupational change are only marginally relevant if they lack observed transitions. Historical or niche group studies that still code inter-/intragenerational mobility (e.g., a community’s occupational classifications over time) are relevant despite their narrow scope.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A clear explanation of what social mobility is — how and why individuals or families move up or down socioeconomic strata — including its types (intergenerational vs. intragenerational), common measures (income, education, occupation), and the main factors that affect it. The user may also want evidence on trends and cross-country comparisons, and policy options to increase mobility.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "social mobility" when it directly discusses changes in people’s socioeconomic position over time or across generations — for example analyses of income mobility, intergenerational earnings elasticity, occupational or educational transitions, mobility matrices, longitudinal studies, or evaluations of policies (like education or tax reforms) intended to increase upward mobility. Relevant documents typically present measures, empirical evidence, country or cohort comparisons, theoretical mechanisms (e.g., role of schooling, labor markets, discrimination), or concrete case studies. Documents are non-relevant if they focus on unrelated meanings of “mobility” (physical movement, transport, or device/mobile technology), on online data disclosure or social-media features, or if they only mention “social mobility” in passing without substantive treatment. Edge cases include reports that use “Social Mobility” as an organizational/program name (which can be relevant if the report evaluates mobility outcomes) and papers that mention mobility briefly in broader studies — those require checking the abstract or methods to decide relevance.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks resources for measuring and analyzing social mobility and inequality, including frameworks like the EGP class scheme and intergenerational status models. They also want methodological guidance and data resources (surveys, mobile/digital behavioral data, and data linking) to conduct robust mobility research and address biases such as sample selectivity.</desc>
	<narr>Relevant content for “social mobility” includes the discussion of the Erikson–Goldthorpe–Portocarero (EGP) class scheme and its cross-national operationalization, because class schemas are core tools for constructing mobility tables and comparing intergenerational and intragenerational mobility across Germany, France, and Great Britain. The mention of the (Blau–)Duncan intergenerational status-attainment model and how educational values transmit status is also directly pertinent to explaining mechanisms of social mobility. By contrast, much of the document focuses on “mobile” data collection, smartphone sensing, and mixed-device web surveys—uses of the word “mobile” that are unrelated to social mobility and would be non-relevant. An edge case is the Microcensus panel’s “spatial mobility” selectivity: while it concerns geographic moves (not class mobility), it could indirectly affect social-mobility analyses by biasing longitudinal samples if movers differ systematically. Measures of attitudes to inequality or welfare can be tangentially relevant only if they are used as predictors or outcomes in mobility research, but on their own they do not document social mobility.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks scholarly resources on the concept of the “social” in sociology and social work, including theory, history, and practice. They want analyses of social inequality, inclusion and health, welfare state policy (notably Austria), social movements (including right-wing activities), social capital, and the professionalization of social work.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it uses the German term “sozial” or its inflected/derived forms centrally and substantively, for example in titles, headings, or abstracts discussing topics like soziale Ungleichheit, Soziale Arbeit, Sozialstaat, soziale Bewegungen, Sozialpolitik, or Sozialkapital. Compounds and derivatives that contain the root count as matches (e.g., Sozialarbeit, Sozialwissenschaften, sozialpolitisch, Sozialpsychologie, sozialräumlich), including hyphenated forms such as sozial-ökologisch and inflections like soziale/sozialer/sozialen/soziales. Documents are weakly relevant or non-relevant if “sozial” appears only incidentally (e.g., in a single citation, an author’s affiliation like Fakultät für Sozialwissenschaften, or as part of a proper name) while the main topic is unrelated. Edge cases include negated or contrary forms like asozial or antisozial (string match but opposite meaning), and OCR or line-break artifacts (sozi-al) that should still be treated as valid matches if they reconstruct to “sozial.” Content in English using only “social” is generally non-relevant for the exact keyword, unless it explicitly targets German terms or provides bilingual coverage where “sozial” is a focal keyword.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking German-language studies and datasets on “sozial” topics, including social media use and political information behavior, social policy and welfare, social housing, social inequality/stratification and mobility, and social security. The goal is to find surveys and analyses profiling attitudes, behaviors, and demographics in these domains in Germany.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “sozial” if it uses the German term or its inflected/compound forms and substantively focuses on social topics, such as soziale Netzwerke, soziale Ungleichheit, Sozialpolitik, sozialer Wohnungsbau, oder soziale Sicherheit. Examples of highly relevant content include studies of intensive users of soziale Netzwerke and their political information behavior, analyses of sozialer Wohnungsbau across federal states, datasets on the Geschichte der Sozialpolitik, and ALLBUS modules on Soziale Ungleichheit, Wohlfahrtsstaat, and soziale Gerechtigkeit. Non-relevant or weakly relevant items are those where “sozial” appears only in passing (e.g., in an institution’s name like „Bundesministerium für Arbeit und Soziales“), in bibliographic boilerplate, or as an isolated variable label without substantive discussion. Edge cases: compounds and derivations (Sozialstaat, Sozialversicherung, sozialpolitisch, Soziale Mobilität) and inflections (soziale/sozialer/sozialen/soziales) should count as matches; occurrences only as English “social” or as a substring in unrelated terms are less likely to be relevant. If the user’s intent is specifically social media, then documents centered on soziale Medien/soziale Netzwerke are most relevant, while broader Sozialpolitik or Wohnungsbau items are thematically social but less on-target.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The query seeks survey-related information about "social": specifically respondents' social class coding and evaluations of the German social market economy (e.g., whether people are satisfied with it), plus which parties or politicians are seen as more socially oriented or best able to solve local social problems (mentioning Bremen).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "sozial" when it substantively discusses social topics such as the social market economy (soziale Marktwirtschaft), social class (soziale Schicht), social policy, or survey questions and responses about who is "socially" oriented or which party can solve social problems in Germany. For example, a policy brief analyzing public opinion on "Was meinen Sie zur sozialen Marktwirtschaft in Deutschland?" or a survey dataset that contains question texts and coded responses about soziale Schicht would be clearly relevant. Documents that are non-relevant include those that only contain the token "sozial" as a metadata label, codebook entry (e.g., v253, v132), repeated boilerplate, or brand/organizational names where no social-policy content is present. Edge cases include files that contain the survey variable labels and question stems but no respondent data (partially useful), translations or English-language texts that use "social" without addressing the German concepts (borderline), and heavily duplicated or corrupted text blocks that mention "sozial" but provide no substantive information.</narr>

They likely want measures applicable to panel studies and cognitive pretests, e.g., in the “Leben im Viertel” neighborhood research context.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it uses the German word “sozial” (including inflected forms like soziale/sozialen/sozialer and compounds) to discuss social constructs, behaviors, or policies, such as soziale Offenheit, soziale Kontrolle, soziale Ungleichheit, Sozialpolitik, soziale Erwünschtheit, or egozentrierte soziale Netzwerke. Examples that clearly match include questionnaires or scales on social desirability (KSE-G), social stressors at work, contact functions with outgroups (including a Soziale Identitätsfunktion), or assessments of Sozialleistungen and their effects. It may be partially relevant when “sozial” appears only within compound nouns (e.g., Sozialpolitik, Sozialleistungen) or hyphenated/spaced variants (sozial-politisch, Sozio Politische), or in descriptions like “soziales Umfeld,” but not when it appears solely in metadata, brand names, or citations without substantive discussion. Edge cases include OCR or spacing variants, capitalization at sentence starts, or related terms like “gesellschaftlich” that are conceptually similar but lack the exact token “sozial”; English “social” may be missed if strict exact matching is required. Frequent, context-rich occurrences across different sections or instrument names generally increase relevance.</narr>

<title>generationen</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The query seeks academic literature on the concept of generations, focusing on how generational identities are constructed and contested in media and social science and how they differ from birth cohorts. It looks for empirical studies on intergenerational relations, family lifespans, historical/political generations (e.g., 68ers, Generation Golf/Praktikum), and second-generation migrants in German-speaking contexts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively discusses human generations as social or demographic cohorts, the construction of “Generationen” in media and scholarship, or relations between age groups (e.g., labels like Generation Golf or Generation Praktikum, Mannheim’s theory of generations, or studies of 68ers and their children). Analyses of intergenerational dynamics—such as family joint lifetimes in three- and four-generation households, the “Generationenvertrag” in pensions, parliamentary cohort turnover, or inequalities affecting the second generation of migrants—also qualify. Empirical and theoretical treatments that show how generations are constituted (through shared experiences, narratives, or mobilization) are especially pertinent, including DDR-specific cohort studies or narrative differences across generations. Non-relevant are uses of “generation” unrelated to human cohorts, such as power/electricity generation, “next‑generation” products/technologies, or generic mentions without analysis. Edge cases include purely genealogical or cohort-statistical pieces: these are relevant when tied to intergenerational interaction, identity, or inequality, but marginal if they only label birth cohorts without connecting them to generational meaning or structure.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks empirical studies and datasets on “generations,” including Gen Z values, intergenerational mobility, relations and conflicts, demographic change, and first/second migrant generations, with a focus on Germany and the EU. It also spans historical “generations” of industrial technologies (e.g., steelmaking processes) and related statistical tables.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “generationen” if it directly discusses human generations or intergenerational dynamics, such as surveys of Generation Z, intergenerational mobility, Alt–Jung relations, or concepts like the Generationenvertrag. It is also relevant when “Generationen” is used as a technical label or family structure, for example “zweite Generation von Kokshochöfen,” “erste Generation Thomaswerke,” or “Drei‑Generationen‑Familie.” Proper nouns and compound forms containing the token count as well, e.g., “Letzte Generation,” “Generation Jetzt,” “Generationenkonflikte,” “intergenerationelle Transfers,” or references to first/second‑generation immigrants. Non‑relevant documents are those that lack the token, use only unrelated meanings (e.g., English “generation” as power production), or include a single incidental mention in metadata without substantive discussion. Edge cases include hyphenation and declension variants (Generationen-, Drei‑Generationen‑Familie), OCR quirks, and industrial “generation” usages that match the string but are less about age cohorts, which may be keyword‑relevant yet topically peripheral.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for information on public attitudes toward different generations, specifically survey items and responses about whether coalition negotiations harm younger people, the upward prospects of 20–35-year-olds, support for climate activists’ demands, and whether future generations should be reminded of or held responsible for crimes of the Third Reich. They need a concise summary of these survey topics and the underlying questions about intergenerational justice, memory, and climate policy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "generationen" if it explicitly discusses age cohorts, intergenerational issues, or references to future or younger generations — for example questions about “the generation of today’s 20–35 year‑olds,” “künftige Generationen,” or survey items on whether future generations should be reminded of the Holocaust. Texts that connect generations to policy or social debates (e.g., coalition negotiations that harm younger people, climate activism by the “Letzte Generation,” or debates about responsibility for Third Reich crimes) are clearly relevant because they address attitudes, impacts, or obligations across generations. Non‑relevant documents mention the string “generationen” only incidentally (product generations, technical “generation” of data, or isolated metadata and question codes like F.135/F.138 without substantive wording) or use the term in an unrelated sense. Edge cases include German variants, OCR/errors and repeated paragraphs: an otherwise short snippet that only lists “Künftige Generationen” might be borderline relevant if fuller context is unavailable, while policy text that uses “generation” metaphorically should be treated cautiously. In indexing, prioritize documents that pair the term with concrete age groups, policies, surveys, or movements (e.g., climate activists) and deprioritize those where the term is a terse label, part code, or unrelated technical term.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user likely wants to understand how “generations” are defined and analyzed in social research—using age and birth cohort—and how intergenerational familial obligations and support (e.g., financial aid) are measured and judged as fair. They may also seek how surveys capture age/cohort and apply these variables in multivariate analyses.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it treats “Generationen” in the sociological/demographic sense—e.g., intergenerational obligations, fairness of support (financial or care), and the distribution of duties between age groups or cohorts. Mentions of age and birth year used to derive cohorts, labels like Nachkriegsgeneration or Baby Boomer, and terms such as intergenerationale Unterstützung or Generationenvertrag strengthen relevance, especially when measurement instruments or methods are described. Non-relevant items use “generationen” in unrelated meanings, such as power/content generation, product “generations” (e.g., 3rd‑generation devices), or texts that discuss age without linking it to cohorts or intergenerational relations. Edge cases include generic phrases like “für alle Generationen” (weakly relevant without analysis) or “Generationenwechsel” in organizational contexts (conditionally relevant if not tied to social support or cohort effects). German texts using compounds like generationenübergreifend or intergenerationale Gerechtigkeit in family or social policy contexts are likely relevant, whereas technical or biological “generation” processes are not.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks a comprehensive understanding of gender—distinguishing it from sex, examining identities, roles, and stereotypes, and how gender structures social life and inequality. They also want evidence and policy approaches (e.g., gender mainstreaming, organizational change, taxation) to explain persistence and promote gender equity across institutions.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “gender” when gender is its central analytic focus—defining gender versus sex, examining gender roles and stereotypes, or addressing identities (e.g., transgender, cisgender, and androgyny) and inequalities such as the wage/work gaps and pay equity. Relevance is strengthened by concrete frameworks, evidence, or contexts, such as gender structure theory, doing/undoing gender, system justification theory, surveys like the European Social Survey, or case studies on gender centers and policies in universities or the EU (e.g., Gender Mainstreaming, institutional resistance). Pieces that only mention “gender” tangentially, treat it solely as biological sex without linking to social dimensions, or shift to broad “diversity” without gender-specific analysis are less relevant; similarly, mere glossary notes or passing historical references are weak matches. Non-English materials can still be highly relevant when they substantively analyze “Geschlecht,” “Gleichstellung,” or policy debates (e.g., German discussions of gender knowledge typologies and equality governance). Edge cases include methodological contributions (e.g., modeling “systemic gender knowledge”) or debates like the Gender Equality Personality Paradox—these remain relevant if they explicitly tie findings to gender processes and structures.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking survey-based information on gender roles, equality, and discrimination, including time use and division of household labor, employment histories, partner dynamics, and gender role orientations. The goal is to analyze patterns of gender inequality and related attitudes and policies in Europe, especially Germany.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “gender” when it substantively addresses gender roles, equality, discrimination, identity, or gendered behaviors and outcomes—for example, modules on time use and distribution of household tasks, partner history and gender role orientation, women’s employment and the gender pay gap, representation of women in politics, or attitudes toward women in the armed forces. Surveys that assess gender inequality and sexism, own experience of gender or gender identity discrimination, or policy measures to improve work–family balance and women’s participation are clearly relevant. Content focused on unrelated topics such as nuclear power, corruption, healthcare safety, natural hazards, or elections is non-relevant unless it explicitly analyzes differences by gender. Edge cases include documents that only list “sex/gender” as a demographic variable or briefly note a parent’s gender; these are only weakly relevant unless they provide breakdowns or questions centered on gender. Also be cautious with modules labeled “gender roles” that contain little gender-specific content, or uses of “gender” in non-social senses, which would be non-relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for a clear definition and overview of "gender" — including distinctions between biological sex and gender, concepts like gender identity and roles, and possibly how to record or code gender in data/surveys (hints: variable labels such as d10, v601).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "gender" if it contains substantive information about gender—such as definitions, discussions of gender identity and roles, demographic statistics, policy or legal analysis on gender equality, or empirical studies of gendered outcomes—rather than just the word appearing incidentally. Documents that are non-relevant typically only contain boilerplate labels or repeated tokens like "d10 GENDER" or variable codes (v601, v615) with no explanatory text, dumps of form field names, or noisy repetition that provides no conceptual or analytical content. Edge cases include survey instruments or data dictionaries where a lone "GENDER" field is meaningful for research on how gender was measured (these are relevant for methodology queries but less so for conceptual queries), and documents that conflate "sex" and "gender"—they may be relevant if they clarify the distinction, or misleading if they use the terms interchangeably without explanation. Also watch for homonyms: texts about grammatical gender in language are about a different concept and may be irrelevant unless the user intended that sense. Examples: a study on workplace gender pay gaps is highly relevant, while a CSV export with thousands of repeated "Gender" labels and no context is not.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user wants guidance on measuring gender in surveys, especially in the German context—covering distinctions between sex and gender, current response options (male, female, diverse), and alternatives for capturing gender identity. They also seek validated instruments for gender role attitudes and related constructs, with evidence of cross-gender measurement invariance.</desc>
	<narr>A document is highly relevant to the query “gender” when gender is the core construct being theorized or measured, such as analyses of gender role orientations, debates over recording sex versus gender identity in surveys, or instruments that assess sexist attitudes (e.g., ambivalent sexism toward men). It remains relevant when the study’s primary focus is explicitly gendered processes or outcomes, like changing gender roles in society or the impact of gender diversity on measurement. By contrast, documents are weakly relevant or non-relevant when “gender” appears only as a routine demographic control, sampling quota, or invariance grouping (e.g., scales on curiosity, gratitude, ICT competence, or study satisfaction merely reporting “scalar invariance across gender” or controlling for evaluators’ gender). Edge cases include tools embedded in modules named for gender (e.g., work–family conflict in a “Changing Gender Roles” module) where the target of measurement is not gender itself, and scales that mention gender only as an example of an ascribed characteristic in broader justice or efficacy constructs. Also non-relevant would be uses of “gender” referring to grammatical gender rather than social gender, whereas discussions distinguishing biological sex, civil status sex, and gender identity are directly relevant.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly addresses Sozialleistungen (social benefits) by discussing their levels, financing, eligibility rules, reforms, or usage, such as analyses of the Sozialleistungsquote, public support for benefit cuts, or access under EU free movement and laws like the Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz. Also relevant are studies on access for specific groups (EU citizens, third‑country nationals, asylum seekers), evidence of discrimination affecting benefit access, employer-provided “betriebliche Sozialleistungen” when framed as part of the benefits landscape, and legal frameworks like the Dutch Koppelingswet that link entitlements to status. Comparative or longitudinal work measuring redistribution via taxes and benefits across countries or time, as well as case studies from other countries that analyze entitlement to social benefits, should count as relevant. Non‑relevant would be pieces on poverty or workplace equality that never connect to benefit programs, purely ideological discussions (e.g., neoliberalism/Thatcherism) unless they specify concrete impacts on benefits, or mentions of services (health, transport) without tying them to social benefit schemes. Edge cases include company benefits that may be only marginally relevant if the intent is state welfare, and broad social policy overviews that mention Sozialleistungen only in passing without data or policy detail.</narr>

<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks an overview and data on Germany’s social benefits (Sozialleistungen), centered on the federal Sozialbudget—its definition, coverage, classifications (by function, institution, and type), financing sources, and key indicators such as the social benefits-to-GDP ratio. They also want related time-series datasets (including West/East comparisons) and surveys on public attitudes, policy preferences, and the use of social benefits, particularly among low-income groups.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it defines Sozialleistungen in the German context and details their scope, purpose, and measurement, especially via the Sozialbudget’s classifications by functions, institutions, types of benefits, financing sources, and indicators like the Sozialleistungsquote. It is also relevant if it provides empirical data on social benefits—tables or time series on pensions, unemployment benefits, social assistance, Asylbewerberleistungen, Bürgergeld reforms, or household receipts of monetary transfers, including West–East comparisons or VGR breakdowns that isolate social transfers. Documents are less relevant when they only mention social benefits in passing within political attitude questions or fiscal trade‑offs (e.g., “cut social benefits vs. raise VAT”) without substantive definitions or data. Edge cases include “employer social benefits”: these are relevant only when they correspond to Sozialbudget items such as wage continuation or occupational and supplementary pensions, but not when they are generic corporate perks. Content centered on unrelated topics (defense policy, workplace climate, administrative contacts) or on macro aggregates that do not identify social transfers should be considered non‑relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for information about public attitudes and survey questions on social benefits — specifically whether welfare should be cut, kept the same, or expanded. They also want to know about concerns over misuse of benefits (e.g., unemployment support/Hartz IV) and whether an SPD election win would lead to further cuts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "sozialleistungen" when it directly addresses public social benefits — for example proposals to cut or expand welfare, news about Arbeitslosengeld or Hartz IV, survey questions asking whether benefits should be reduced or increased, or discussions of alleged missbrauch (abuse) of benefits. Concrete policy texts, legislative proposals, opinion polls, and journalistic analyses about how elections (e.g., an SPD victory) would affect benefit levels are clear matches. Documents are non-relevant when the term appears in an unrelated sense (company employee benefits, private insurance), in isolated metadata or repeating codes with no topical content, or as OCR/spam duplicates that add no new information. Edge cases include statistical reports that mention Sozialleistungen only as a demographic variable (partly relevant), texts that use synonyms or English translations (welfare, social assistance) which should be treated as relevant if they refer to public transfers, and documents with topic codes like "V99" — these codes can be relevant if they are indexing topical content but are low value by themselves.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks information or a survey framework for evaluating social policy and social benefits across four dimensions: living standards, economic effects, social effects, and recipient dependency/inertia. They want a concise assessment tool or analysis capturing perceptions of these impacts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively discusses Sozialleistungen (public social benefits) within social policy, especially evaluations of their impact on living standards, their economic and social consequences, or recipient behavior (e.g., work disincentives/inertia). Examples include survey questionnaires assessing perceptions of welfare, analyses of unemployment benefits, child allowances, pensions, or Bürgergeld/ALG II, and studies on how transfers affect poverty, employment, or social cohesion. Synonyms and related terms like Sozialhilfe, Transferleistungen, Hartz IV, or benefits from health insurance within the welfare state also signal relevance. Documents are non-relevant if “Leistungen” refers to unrelated contexts (e.g., corporate perks, individual performance, or generic “services”), if the term appears only in passing, or if the piece is broad political commentary without concrete discussion of benefits. Edge cases include employer-provided “betriebliche Sozialleistungen” or country-specific frameworks (Austria/Switzerland) which are relevant only if explicitly connected to public welfare effects or evaluations.</narr>

<title>sozialisation</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is looking for a comprehensive overview of socialization as a social-science concept, covering definitions, theories, models, and empirical research across domains such as vocational training, political and international socialization, gender, military service, education, and life-course development. They want to understand key debates, effectiveness, and implications in largely German/European scholarship.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it primarily defines, theorizes, or empirically examines Sozialisation—such as vocational socialization across training and careers, political socialization, gendered socialization, or international socialization of states—and discusses processes, mechanisms, models, or outcomes. Clear positives include textbooks or reviews linking life-course data (e.g., ALLBUS) to socialization, case studies of Bundeswehr conscripts, analyses of DDR vs. West German value trajectories, workplace/apprenticeship socialization, and edited volumes or TOCs whose chapters explicitly center on Sozialisation (e.g., “berufliche,” “politische,” “internationale,” “Selbstsozialisation”). Variants and compounds like Sozialisationsforschung, Sozialisationsprozess, Sozialisationsmodelle, and inflected forms count, and case does not matter. A document is non-relevant if Sozialisation is only a passing reference, appears solely in metadata or citations, or refers to a different concept (e.g., “Sozialisierung” as economic nationalization) without engaging socialization processes. Edge cases: critical or reframing debates (e.g., questioning “weibliche Sozialisation” in gender studies) remain relevant if they analyze how subjects become gendered, while broad education-system pieces that merely invoke Sozialisation as a background term without substantive treatment are borderline.</narr>

<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking research and survey data on how socialization in family, school, and broader social contexts shapes authoritarianism, democratic attitudes, and related political orientations among German youth and students. They are particularly interested in measurement scales (e.g., authoritarianism, ethnocentrism, antisemitism), political participation, and demographic correlates across multiple domains.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it analyzes the processes, agents, and contexts of socialization (e.g., family, school, peers, political institutions, workplace/university) and how they shape attitudes or behavior, especially among youth. Examples include studies using scales on authoritarianism and family authority, surveys of school or political socialization, professional/organizational socialization of students, teachers, elites, fraternities, or even socialization in sports clubs and prisons, ideally with explicit measures, indices, or longitudinal tracking. Demographic blocks and interview metadata support such analyses but, by themselves, do not make a document relevant. Non-relevant items are those that only mention “Sozialisation” tangentially or in other senses (e.g., animal socialization, “socializing” costs in economics), or that discuss attitudes and party preferences without linking them to socialization processes or agents. Edge cases like studies on authority, prejudice, or participation are relevant only when they explicitly connect these outcomes to socializing influences from family, school, peers, or organizations.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A request to report, on a given scale, how much religious education influenced one’s upbringing in the parental home — i.e., to quantify the role of religious socialization by the family. This information is needed to assess the strength of familial socialization in shaping religious values and practices.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "sozialisation" if it explicitly addresses processes of socialization—especially family-centered topics such as how parental upbringing and religious education shaped a person—like the survey prompt "Bitte sagen Sie mir anhand dieser Skala jetzt welche Rolle in Ihrem Elternhaus die religiöse Erziehung gespielt hat." Relevant examples include questionnaire items, interview transcripts about parental influence, sociological studies of religious socialization, and codebooks reporting Likert-scale answers. Non-relevant documents include uses of similar words in other senses (e.g., workplace onboarding, animal socialization), pages that only contain the keyword without substantive content, or completely unrelated topics such as product descriptions or news articles. Edge cases include texts that mention "religiöse Erziehung" but treat it theologically rather than as a socialization process, translations or survey templates that include the phrase but lack empirical data, and documents with HTML artifacts (like "br" or "Answer:") that signal a scraped or partially formatted questionnaire—these may be partially relevant depending on whether they preserve the socialization context.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>User wants a clear explanation of "socialization"—how family and early social experiences shape attitudes, values and behaviors. They also want to know how researchers operationalize and measure socialization in surveys and studies (e.g., parental behavior dimensions, scales for early musical socialization, items on family roles, and cognitive pretesting/translations).</desc>
	<narr>This document is highly relevant to the keyword "sozialisation" because it explicitly treats familial and early-life socialization processes — e.g., "musikalische Frühsozialisation," "familiäre Sozialisationsbedingungen," "Primärsozialisation," and parental rearing behaviors — and links them to attitudes, identity and generative behavior. Relevant passages include concrete examples such as scales measuring parental support versus religious upbringing, biographical inventories capturing primary socialization, and questions about parental roles and desired family size. It would be less relevant if the emphasis of a document were purely methodological (translation checks, cognitive pretests, or questionnaire administration) or if the topic were an unrelated use of the word (e.g., "socialization" meaning a social event). Edge cases include texts that mention socialization only as a background variable or focus only on scale construction and psychometrics: these are partially relevant for terminology and measurement but less useful for substantive theorizing about socialization processes.</narr>

<title>soziale herkunft</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks research-based insights on how social origin (class background) influences educational attainment, competence gaps, study choices, social mobility, and academic careers in Germany, and how these patterns have changed over time. They also want evidence on mechanisms, gender differences, and the role of school factors or policies in mitigating disparities, drawing on datasets like ALLBUS, NEPS, and SOEP.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly analyzes soziale Herkunft (social/class background) and its effects on outcomes such as educational achievement, school transitions (e.g., Gymnasium attendance, degree attainment), study-field choice, academic careers (e.g., professors’ backgrounds), social mobility, or life satisfaction, ideally defining and measuring origin via parents’ education, occupation, or SES and modeling mechanisms (e.g., Bourdieu’s habitus, reproduction theory). Empirical studies using German datasets like ALLBUS, SOEP, or NEPS, or examining how school factors (teaching quality, full-day programs, class composition) shape competence gaps by social origin, are strongly relevant, as are time-trend or gender/field comparisons. Works that use close synonyms (social background, class origin, SES) or examine nationality/immigration only insofar as these are tied to class background and its effects can be partially relevant. A document is non-relevant if Herkunft refers solely to nationality/ethnicity/region or “migration background” without a class dimension, if it treats origin only in passing without analysis, or if it discusses unrelated meanings (e.g., product or genetic origin). Edge cases include theoretical or methodological pieces on mobility or habitus that lack new data (still relevant if they center the role of social origin), qualitative case studies (e.g., boarding schools’ doing/undoing class) that foreground class mechanisms, and near-duplicate summaries that add little unique evidence.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks studies and datasets on social origin (family background/class) and its effects on schooling outcomes, educational transitions, spatial/occupational mobility, and related attitudes, mainly in German contexts. They want variables and replication materials measuring parents’ education/occupation, class and wealth indices, grades/test scores, and demographics.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly examines soziale Herkunft (social origin/class background) as a measured variable or concept and links it to outcomes or behaviors, for example studies on school success and grades, educational transitions and spatial mobility (e.g., NEPS analyses), or occupational prestige, class identification, and parental education/occupation. Dataset descriptions are also relevant when they include concrete variables capturing social origin (father’s job, parental education, class/Schichtzugehörigkeit) or report results such as the social origin of medical or sports students. Historical analyses that present tables on students’ social background or discuss how social origin shaped professionalization count as relevant. Non-relevant or weakly relevant items include documents where Herkunft refers only to regional/ethnic origin, or where “soziale Herkunft” appears merely in a long demographic checklist without analysis or findings tied to it (e.g., surveys on dialect or housing that just record social origin). Edge cases include replication files that analyze social-origin effects (relevant), and surveys on mobility that mention social origin among controls but never interpret it (borderline).</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A clear definition of "soziale Herkunft" (social origin) and how it is measured and used in surveys — e.g., which indicators (parents' education/occupation, household status, migration background) define someone’s social background and how that classification is applied to analyze attitudes or behaviors.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "soziale herkunft" when it explicitly discusses a person's social origin or social class — for example questions or passages about parental education, occupation, income, upbringing, self‑identified social stratum, or survey items labeled "soziale Herkunft" or "soziale Schicht." Passages that treat "Herkunft" as ethnic or national origin (e.g., "ausländischer Herkunft" or asking how aware someone was of different origin) can be partially relevant if the search accepts cultural/ethnic background, but they differ from strictly socio‑economic measures. Documents that are not relevant use "Herkunft" to mean provenance of objects or data (e.g., funds of unknown origin, CDs of dubious origin) or discuss the "soziale Marktwirtschaft" as an economic policy rather than individual background. Edge cases include transcripts with repeated metadata or ambiguous mentions of "Herkunft" — these should only be included if surrounding text clearly links the term to social class, mobility, or upbringing.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks German-language surveys and validated scales to study social origin (socioeconomic background) and its links to inequality, mobility, and social attitudes, including measures of social openness, control, discrimination, and related psychosocial constructs. They likely want instruments, methodologies (e.g., panel/neighborhood studies, web probing), and evidence on reliability and validity.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to “soziale Herkunft” if it defines or measures social origin/social background (e.g., parental education or occupation, class origin, SES in the family of origin) or analyzes intergenerational mobility using origin–destination frameworks. By contrast, materials focused only on attitudes or personality constructs—such as social desirability (KSE-G), Right-Wing Authoritarianism, curiosity scales, self-monitoring, or neighborhood openness/control—are not relevant unless they explicitly link those outcomes to respondents’ social origin. Sections on “Aufstiegsmobilität” or “soziale Ungleichheit” become relevant only if they examine mobility conditional on class/parental background or include variables/proxies for Herkunft (e.g., “sozialer Hintergrund,” “Schicht,” “Elternhaus”). Items about intergenerational obligations, evaluation of social policy, or reasons for not using cessation aids are at most indirectly relevant and only count if used to compare groups by social origin. Edge cases include studies on immigrant integration or neighborhood discrimination that are relevant only when they treat parental SES/class or origin milieu as explanatory factors; instruments like ego-centered network name generators or workplace social stressors are non-relevant.</narr>

<title>migrationshintergrund</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an overview of the German concept of “Migrationshintergrund,” including how it is defined and measured across official statistics and surveys. They want evidence on how migration background relates to outcomes in health, education, labor market and welfare participation, and political engagement, with attention to gender, age, generation, and origin-group differences.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses the German concept “Migrationshintergrund” and provides substantive analysis, definitions, or statistics about people with and without migration background, including measurement approaches and domain-specific outcomes (e.g., health, education, labor market, political participation). Examples of highly relevant content include studies comparing ALG II recipients by Migrationshintergrund, KiGGS findings on adolescents’ health behaviors by migration background, analyses of scientists or seniors with Migrationshintergrund, or reports on rehabilitation access and dementia prevalence among these groups. Methodological debates and critiques of the term (e.g., municipal-statistical derivation vs self-identification, subgroup breakdowns by gender, origin, or generation) are also relevant because they clarify how the construct is defined and used. Non-relevant documents discuss migration broadly without using or mapping to the specific German concept, or mention the word only in passing (e.g., in a keyword list or citation) without analysis. Edge cases include English texts using “(im)migrant background” that clearly refer to the German statistical construct (relevant), and topic-adjacent pieces on refugees or international students that are only relevant if explicitly tied to the Migrationshintergrund framework.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks datasets and research on people with a migration background in Germany, with a focus on higher education (equality work, students and academic staff), support structures, and policy. It also covers integration experiences, discrimination and racism, labor market and hiring experiments, political attitudes and participation, neighborhood diversity and social networks, and religiosity.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses “Migrationshintergrund” (migration background) as a core concept—e.g., comparing people with and without migration background, reporting shares of students or staff with migration background, or using it as a sampling or analytical variable in surveys or experiments. Examples include university equality work that covers support and discrimination by ethnic origin for students and scientific staff with migration background, nationwide surveys on values or racism among Germans with and without migration background, election studies of groups defined by origin (e.g., Turkish or ex‑Soviet), or hiring experiments where “Migrationshintergrund” is an experimental factor. Documents that operationalize the concept indirectly—such as distinguishing “Deutsche mit/ohne Migrationshintergrund,” onomastic name-based classification, second/third generation markers, or neighborhood measures of residents with migration background—are also relevant. Non‑relevant are items that discuss migration in general without defining or measuring “Migrationshintergrund,” equality topics with no migrant dimension, or texts where the term appears only incidentally (e.g., a single variable label) without substantive analysis; clearly unrelated uses like data or animal “migration” are out. Edge cases include studies that only restrict a subsample (e.g., parents of youths without migration background) or mention the term in metadata—these are borderline unless they provide definitions, data, or findings about groups by migration background.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants a clear definition and explanation of the German term "Migrationshintergrund" — who is counted as having a migration background, how the term is used in official statistics, forms, and law, and what social or administrative implications it carries. They may also be seeking criteria, examples, or guidance on how to report this status on documents.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "migrationshintergrund" if it treats that term as the demographic or legal concept used in German-speaking contexts — for example studies, reports or policies that analyze people "mit Migrationshintergrund" or provide census and school statistics by migration background. Relevant examples include government or NGO reports on integration, academic articles about educational outcomes by migration background, public-health research stratified by Migrationshintergrund, and policy briefs on anti-discrimination measures. Documents are non-relevant when the word appears only incidentally or in an unrelated sense, such as software/database migration logs, travelogues, genealogical migration histories, or when it is merely part of a filename or metadata with no substantive discussion. Edge cases include texts in other languages that discuss the same concept (those are relevant if they clearly map to the German category), short tables that list counts without explanation (borderline relevance), and personal anecdotes about individual immigrants (relevant only if they connect to the broader category or analysis).</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses the German concept of “Migrationshintergrund,” such as defining it, typologizing it, or operationalizing it in surveys and datasets (e.g., Mikrozensus 2005–2009 or PIAAC-L), including guidance or code (SAS/SPSS/Stata) to derive the variable. Studies that develop or validate instruments for people with and without migration background, or that include questionnaire items on origin culture, migration background, and related demographics, also qualify. By contrast, materials focused on employment measurement concepts (Labour Force vs. Unterhaltskonzept) or identity in general that do not link outcomes to migration background are non-relevant. Edge cases include pre-2008 datasets that provide methods to reconstruct a migration-background variable (relevant), English synonyms like “migrant/immigrant background” (relevant), and documents with only passing mentions without definitions, measures, or analysis tied to migration background (likely not relevant). Irrelevant homonyms such as “background migration” in IT or biology should be excluded.</narr>

They also want to understand consequences for health and aging, education, and the environment, along with public perceptions and policy debates around inequality.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it primarily analyzes, defines, measures, or debates soziale Ungleichheit (social inequality) in society—such as class and stratification theories, income/wealth disparities, educational and health inequalities, perceptions of fairness, or “new” dimensions like aging, gender, migration, or environmental justice. Empirical studies (e.g., ALLBUS or the Sozialer Survey Österreich), theoretical syntheses in the Marx/Weber tradition or intersectionality, and sectoral reviews in social epidemiology or education are all relevant, even when focused on specific groups (older adults) or domains (health), provided the social-inequality link is explicit and central. Documents are non-relevant if they only mention inequality in passing, treat Ungleichheit purely as an economic indicator without social-structural analysis, or use the term in a mathematical sense. Edge cases include climate-change or environmental pieces: they are relevant when they explicitly connect unequal impacts to social stratification, vulnerability, or justice, but not when they note disparities without social analysis. Language or geography do not disqualify relevance (e.g., German texts on Germany or Austria are fine), whereas uses of “sozial” in unrelated contexts (like social media) or purely moral commentary without analytical content are not.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks survey-based datasets and analyses on social inequality—its determinants, perceptions, and consequences—focusing mainly on Germany (with some references to Poland), covering socioeconomic status, mobility, education, income, health, and political attitudes. They are looking for resources like ALLBUS and ISSP modules, GISD, TwinLife, and IQB studies to enable trend and comparative assessments.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly addresses social inequality—e.g., measures or discusses socioeconomic status, income distribution, social mobility, education and occupational stratification, deprivation indices (such as a German deprivation index), or public attitudes toward inequality and the welfare state, ideally with empirical data from surveys like ALLBUS or ISSP. Content that analyzes mechanisms and consequences of inequality (acceptance of inequality across classes, intergenerational comparisons, regional disparities, or links to health outcomes) is highly relevant, as are studies on related domains like educational disparities, labor-market status, or political trust when explicitly tied to inequality. Materials focused mainly on other topics (national identity, religion, or general politics) without an explicit connection to social inequality, or purely methodological/administrative notes about surveys without inequality measures, are less relevant. Edge cases include documents on specific subtypes (gender inequality, migration-related disparities, or digital divide) which are relevant if framed as aspects of social inequality, and pieces using “Ungleichheit” in non-social senses (e.g., mathematical inequalities) which are non-relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for a clear overview of "soziale Ungleichheit" — what social inequality is, how it is measured (income, education, occupation/social class), its main causes and social consequences. They also want to understand how social class relates to public attitudes (e.g., toward the social market economy) and political choices or party solutions for social problems in Germany.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "soziale ungleichheit" if it explicitly discusses social inequality or its indicators (income, wealth, education, occupational class, poverty, social mobility), describes causes or consequences, or evaluates policies aimed at reducing unequal outcomes. The paragraph includes potentially relevant terms — "Soziale Schicht," "soziale Marktwirtschaft," and "soziale Probleme" and political questions about which party can solve social problems — which are useful when they report measurements, opinions, or analyses of distributional differences. It is non-relevant when the text is only metadata, repeated survey codes and labels (v253, v132, Punktbewertung, Vercoden, IfD) or verbatim question duplicates that contain no substantive results or interpretation. Edge cases: a survey question about support for the "soziale Marktwirtschaft" is relevant if used to study attitudes toward inequality or redistribution, but irrelevant if it appears only as an isolated question label; likewise, the label "Soziale Schicht" is relevant when linked to respondent data but not when it appears only in a coding legend. Prioritize documents with actual measures, analysis, or contextual explanation of inequality and deprioritize those that are mere administrative or repetitive text.</narr>

They want resources on attitudes toward inequality, income/wealth distribution graphics, the EGP class schema, and links between perceived inequality and populist attitudes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it analyzes, measures, or explains social inequality—such as the distribution of income and wealth, class/stratification and mobility, public attitudes toward inequality, or policy consequences for inequality. Strong examples include ALLBUS modules on attitudes to social inequality, an egalitarianism/meritocracy scale that justifies or critiques inequality, projects that present income/wealth graphics to shift perceived inequality and populist views, or methodological work on the EGP class schema used to operationalize social stratification. Studies on neighborhood openness or social control are relevant when they explicitly link to egalitarian attitudes or inequality outcomes, and evaluations of social policy are pertinent when they assess effects on socio-economic disparities. By contrast, instruments on social desirability (e.g., KSE-G), social recognition needs, workplace social stressors, smoking-cessation barriers, student problems, contact-function inventories, or anomie are non-relevant unless they directly connect to inequality. Edge cases include methodological pretests that merely mention “soziale Ungleichheit” without substantive content, or instances where the term appears only in citations; documents using related terms like class, stratification, mobility, or wealth distribution still qualify as relevant.</narr>

<title>soziale lage</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an overview of the concept of soziale Lage (social position) in Germany—how it is defined and measured (e.g., class/occupation, income, wealth), what determines it (family background), and its effects on life chances, health, and participation. They likely want empirical findings on intergenerational mobility and inequalities across regions and groups (East/West, gender, migrants), plus key data sources such as ALLBUS, SOEP, EVS, and the Mikrozensus.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it treats soziale Lage as a social position or condition in society, defining or operationalizing it via class/strata concepts, household clusters, or multidimensional indicators. Empirical work that measures or compares social positions—e.g., by sex, age, employment status, East/West Germany, intergenerational mobility—using datasets like ALLBUS, SOEP, Mikrozensus, or EVS, and indicators such as income, wealth (including pensions), health, and political participation is squarely relevant. Studies on specific groups (teachers, migrants, single parents, refugees) or locales (e.g., DDR Umsiedler, Hamburg neighborhoods) are relevant when they explicitly analyze their soziale Lage or link it to inequality, mobility, or outcomes; methodological pieces on longitudinal/event-history models also qualify if they model transitions between social positions. Non-relevant are texts where Lage refers to geographic location, or policy commentary that mentions soziale Lage only in passing without defining, measuring, or comparing social positions. Edge cases include theory-driven work (e.g., Bourdieu’s social space), which is relevant if connected to mapping/measuring social positions, and attitude studies, which are relevant only when they model the effect of social position (class, education, income) on attitudes rather than just reporting opinions.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks research and survey data on “soziale Lage” (socioeconomic status and living conditions), especially in Germany, including subjective perceptions, social mobility, inequality, and related attitudes toward poverty, wealth, and marginalized groups.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “soziale lage” if it explicitly analyzes social position or strata (soziale Lagen) of individuals or groups, operationalized through socio-economic indicators, class/stratification schemes, or mobility, and not merely general “situational” assessments. Highly relevant examples include studies using a multidimensional typology of social strata, qualitative interviews on perceived social mobility and participation among disadvantaged groups, historical analyses of poverty records (“soziale und ökonomische Lage” of the house-poor), or datasets detailing the social position of professions (e.g., shoemakers) or academics, with variables like income, education, occupation, household structure, and “Schichtzugehörigkeit.” Documents that only discuss the general or economic situation (“wirtschaftliche Lage,” “Lage Berlins,” “weltpolitische Lage”) without linking it to social status, stratification, or inequalities are non-relevant. Edge cases can be surveys listing “soziale Lage,” “soziale Integration,” or “soziale Gerechtigkeit” among many themes: they are relevant if they provide measures or analysis tied to social positioning, but weakly relevant if the term appears only as a checklist item. Synonyms and close concepts such as “soziale und wirtschaftliche Situation,” “soziale Mobilität,” “Schicht,” and “sozialer Auf- bzw. Abstieg” strengthen relevance, whereas pure market research or media-use studies without a social-status frame do not.</narr>

They are also interested in public perceptions (e.g., whether the situation of the socially weak has improved), attitudes toward the social market economy, and which political parties are seen as best able to solve social problems.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "soziale lage" when it contains substantive content about people’s social or economic position, welfare of socially weak groups, or attitudes toward social policy — for example the repeated survey question “Was meinen Sie zur sozialen Marktwirtschaft in Deutschland” and items about “sozial Schwachen” and “Soziale Schicht” are direct matches. Metadata and variable codes (v253, v132, v114, v883, F.36b, F30) that label such questions are also relevant when they point to measures of social status or social problems, because they enable linking responses to social-lage analyses. The document is less relevant if it only contains administrative codes, duplicate lines, date stamps, or pagination without the substantive question text (e.g., long repeated copies of the same label or raw coding lists with no context). Edge cases include mentions of “soziale” in compound terms: “soziale Marktwirtschaft” is relevant but narrower (policy attitude rather than objective economic status), while a lone occurrence of “soziale” in an unrelated context (social media, organizational names) would not be relevant.</narr>

They want guidance on indicators and operationalizations—e.g., occupational prestige (MPS), the EGP class schema, occupational classifications and mappings (ISCO/KldB, Blossfeld), applications to datasets like the Mikrozensus, and related scales on inequality, mobility, and social desirability.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “soziale lage” if it defines, measures, or operationalizes individuals’ or households’ social position in a stratification framework, for example via occupational prestige (MPS), class schemas (EGP/CASMIN), or proxies in official statistics (e.g., identifying the household’s main income earner in the Mikrozensus). Highly relevant examples include studies that map the Magnitude Prestige Scale to occupational classifications (ISCO vs. KldB), construct EGP classes from national labor data, or reconstruct socioeconomic position measures for specific datasets and time periods. Work on social inequality and mobility is relevant when it explicitly links outcomes to status indicators such as class, prestige, education, income, or employment position, or when it provides scales or coding schemes to estimate these. Documents are non-relevant if they focus on other psychosocial constructs (e.g., social desirability, anomie, workplace social stressors, contact functions, neighborhood social control/openness, smoking-cessation barriers) without measuring or analyzing social position. Edge cases include papers that mention “soziale Lage” only rhetorically, or analyze outcomes (e.g., student problems) by class/status without detailing how status is measured; conversely, texts using close synonyms like “sozio-ökonomische Lage,” “Status,” “Prestige,” “Klasse/Schicht,” or “Berufsprestige” are relevant even if the exact phrase does not appear.</narr>

<title>soziale kontakte</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks research-based insights into social contacts—how they are formed, measured, and leveraged—and their effects on integration and outcomes across contexts such as universities, migration/refugee settings, neighborhoods, online dating, and social media. Emphasis includes interethnic contact, language learning, attitudes toward refugees, access to resources and mobility, and methodological differences in measuring contact.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it examines interpersonal social contacts—who interacts with whom, how frequently, and with what quality or outcomes—such as student–teacher relationships at universities, interethnic friendships between migrants and natives, refugees’ ties in neighborhoods, or contact initiation in online dating. Studies that link neighborhood context, personal networks, or friendship structures to integration, support, mobility, or social isolation (defined as a lack of close or casual contacts) are also relevant, as are methodological pieces on how interethnic contacts are measured with surveys or network generators. By contrast, texts that use “Kontakt” to mean exposure to information rather than people (e.g., incidental contact with campaign messages on social media) or that focus solely on institutional procedures without human-to-human interaction are only weakly relevant. Edge cases include research on social media or language learning: it is relevant when it addresses the formation or effects of interpersonal ties, but not when it discusses platform reach or skills acquisition without a social-contact component.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is looking for studies and data on social contacts in Germany—how often and with whom different groups (e.g., refugees, guest workers, homeless, elderly, students, professionals) interact in neighborhoods, friendships, and workplaces. They want to understand how factors like housing type and demographics affect social integration, networks, and well-being.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly examines social interactions or networks—such as the frequency and context of contacts with neighbors, friends, colleagues, or members of other groups—and links these contacts to integration, well‑being, or community life. Examples include studies reporting contacts between refugees and Germans in the neighborhood, surveys of older adults on how often they meet family and friends, or instruments measuring contacts with Gastarbeiter at work, in the family, or friendship circles, as well as research on homeless residents’ contacts to non-homeless or young Aussiedlers’ friendship and leisure contacts. It may also be relevant if it captures related indicators like time spent with others, neighborhood ties, or club/association membership as proxies for social contacts. By contrast, documents that focus mainly on economic conditions, policy assessments, or demographics without measuring interpersonal interactions, or that use “contact” in a procedural/institutional sense (e.g., interviewer contact attempts, contacts with authorities) are non-relevant. Edge cases include broad multi-topic surveys: they are relevant if they contain substantive items on contact frequency or networks, but not if “contact” appears only as a technical fieldwork note or phone/communication access variable.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants to know about a person's social contacts — specifically the quality of contact with neighbors and whether they have personal contacts with Germans. They also want to know if the person has been in contact with state- or non‑profit advice or social‑security institutions in Germany within the past five years.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "soziale kontakte" when it discusses interpersonal social ties — for example the quality or frequency of contact with neighbors, personal friendships, or whether someone has personal contacts with Germans — or when it records interactions with social support services that reflect a person’s social network. Direct examples of relevant content are survey questions like "Wie ist der Kontakt zu den Nachbarn?" or "Haben Sie persönlich Kontakte zu Deutschen?" and items asking whether a respondent has been in contact with counseling or social-security organizations in the last five years. A document is non‑relevant if it uses the words "Kontakt" or "soziale" in a different sense (e.g., physical contact, contact lenses, or abstract social policy) or if it only contains boilerplate/duplicated administrative text without substantive information on social ties. Edge cases include papers about public‑health measures that reduce social contacts (which are relevant if the user’s intent is social interaction) and texts that describe institutional contact (e.g., with agencies) — these may be relevant only if the queryer cares about social support networks rather than purely personal relationships.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks German-language survey instruments and research for measuring social contacts and related constructs—especially motivations for intercultural contact, acculturation orientations, neighborhood social openness/control, egocentric networks, and social desirability/stressors.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to “soziale kontakte” if it directly examines social interactions or networks, or provides tools to measure contact behavior and opportunities for contact. Clear hits include instruments like the Kontaktfunktionsinventar (KFI-30) on motives for intergroup contact, name generators for egocentric social networks, neighborhood “social openness/social control” measures, and scales on workplace relationship stressors, because they address how contacts are formed, maintained, or constrained. Partial relevance applies to constructs such as need for social recognition, social proximity, feelings of social rejection, or self-monitoring: these shape interpersonal behavior but do not measure social contacts themselves. Non-relevant items are scales on social desirability bias (e.g., Crowne–Marlowe, KSE-G), social inequality/egalitarianism, anomie, lying/denial, social policy evaluations, or reasons for not using smoking-cessation aids, since they center on attitudes or behaviors unrelated to contact. An edge case is acculturation (AKOrM): while acculturation theory invokes contact, documents are only relevant if they operationalize contact (e.g., frequency or breadth of cross-cultural interactions) rather than cultural orientation alone.</narr>

<title>soziale kompetenzen</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking information on social competencies: their definition, measurement, and how they can be developed. They want research-based insights on the impact of social competencies across contexts such as education and motivation, employability, intercultural training, reintegration, parenting, and gender dynamics.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly examines soziale Kompetenzen (social competence/skills) as a construct, including its measurement, development, training, or effects in contexts like schooling, work, parenting, rehabilitation, or migration. Clear positives include empirical studies where social competence moderates student motivation, interventions such as inmate social-skills programs (e.g., SoKoS), hiring evaluations that rate applicants’ social competence, or research on children’s sozial-emotionale Kompetenzen linked to family factors. Theoretical treatments or frameworks that list “Soziale Kompetenz” (e.g., a chapter in a competencies volume or workforce reports highlighting social-interactive skills) are also relevant, as are studies of interkulturelle Kompetenz when they explicitly measure or discuss social/interactive components. Non-relevant are items where Kompetenz means jurisdiction/authority (state “Kompetenzen”), discussions of soziale Sicherung or welfare without social skills, or texts focused solely on other competencies (e.g., IT, media, or cognitive) with no substantive link to social competence—even if both words appear separately. Edge cases include synonyms like sozial-emotional or communicative skills, peer-relations training, or mixed “soziale und technische Kompetenzen”; these count if they analyze social skills in depth rather than mentioning them in passing.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks an explanation of social competencies (social skills), including their definition, key components, and ways to assess or develop them. The focus may be on German educational and institutional contexts where such competencies are surveyed or evaluated.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses social competencies (Sozialkompetenz), such as interpersonal communication, empathy, cooperation, teamwork, conflict resolution, prosocial behavior, or social-emotional learning, including their definition, development, assessment, or training. Studies reporting validated scales or interventions (e.g., classroom SEL programs, workplace soft-skill training, SOKO-type measures) or curriculum frameworks that include a “social competence” domain count as relevant. Documents are non-relevant when “Kompetenz” refers to institutional/political competence (e.g., competence of parties, police, Bundestag) or to academic competencies in math/science, or when “sozial” refers to social policy, institutions, or demographics rather than interpersonal skills. Edge cases include mentions of “soziales Engagement” or “soziale Zusammensetzung”: these are not relevant unless they explicitly link engagement/composition to individuals’ social skill levels; similarly, higher-education “study competence” is irrelevant unless it includes a social-skills subscale. Useful synonyms and cues include Sozialkompetenz, sozial-emotionale Kompetenzen, Soft Skills, zwischenmenschliche Fähigkeiten, Empathie, Teamfähigkeit, Kommunikationskompetenz, as well as terms like Skala, Validierung, Intervention, Training.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for a clear definition and examples of "soziale Kompetenzen" (social/interpersonal skills) — e.g., communication, teamwork, empathy, conflict resolution — and guidance on how to identify, assess, or describe these abilities when comparing job requirements or answering surveys and application questions.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "soziale kompetenzen" when it explicitly discusses personal social skills or closely related synonyms — for example mentions of "soziale Fähigkeiten", "Teamfähigkeit", "Kommunikationsfähigkeit", "Empathie" or passages defining "Kompetenzen" in a social or interpersonal context. In the supplied paragraph, the sentence "Diese Frage bezieht sich auf Ihre Fähigkeiten. Unter Fähigkeiten verstehen wir alle Kenntnisse Fertigkeiten Kompetenzen ..." could be relevant if the surrounding questions ask about interpersonal work skills, whereas repeated references to "Und wer ist sozialer eingestellt ..." also point toward social orientation and may be relevant. Conversely, many lines referring to "soziale Marktwirtschaft", "Soziale Schicht", "soziale Probleme" or the "Kompetenz" of the Bundeskanzler are non‑relevant because they treat "sozial" as a political or economic adjective rather than individual social competencies. Edge cases include generic mentions of "Fähigkeiten" (ambiguous — potentially relevant if later narrowed to social skills) and survey items about being "sozial eingestellt" which are borderline and require checking whether they measure interpersonal competence or political/social attitudes.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is looking for information on social competencies, specifically definitions, dimensions, and validated instruments to measure social skills and related psychosocial constructs across contexts (workplace, education, community). They likely want scales/questionnaires, their development and validation, and how they are used in surveys and evaluations.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to “soziale kompetenzen” when it defines, operationalizes, or measures social skills such as communication, cooperation, empathy, conflict management, or teamwork ability, ideally via validated scales or behavioral assessments. For example, a questionnaire that rates employees’ interpersonal effectiveness in teams or a scale assessing adolescents’ social interaction competence would fit well. By contrast, instruments on political efficacy (PEKS), ICT/literacy competencies (PIAAC), body experience, social stressors at work, social desirability or need for approval, attitudes toward social inequality, neighborhood social control/openness, or didactic competence of instructors are non-relevant because they address attitudes, environments, or non-social domains rather than social skill capacities. Edge cases include tools that mention “Kompetenz” or “soziale” in other contexts (e.g., general or didactic competence, presence of team work without assessing team skills), which are only relevant if they explicitly evaluate social skill performance; broad batteries with subscales like “soziale Nähe” or “soziale Attraktivität” are at most tangential unless linked to functional social capability. Measures of egocentric social networks (name generators) describe relationship structure, not competence, and are only relevant if used to assess social skill use.</narr>

<title>soziale arbeit</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an academic overview of social work (Soziale Arbeit), emphasizing its historical development and professionalization in Germany and its status as a scientific discipline. They want key theoretical frameworks and current debates on its political mandate, human-rights basis, gender/class perspectives, and practice domains such as refugee work and network governance.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses Soziale Arbeit/social work as a profession, discipline, or practice—e.g., tracing its historical development and professionalization, debating its political mandate, presenting theoretical frameworks (systems theory, human rights, class, gender), or discussing training, governance, and specific fields like refugee support or network management. Works that examine social work in particular contexts (East Germany, Czechoslovakia under socialism, relations to social movements, welfare associations) are also relevant when they link those contexts to social work’s functions, concepts, methods, or curricula. Synonyms and adjacent terms such as Sozialarbeit, Sozialpädagogik, IFSW definitions, DGSA/DBSH standards, or “Arbeit am Sozialen” count if they clearly pertain to the profession’s theory or practice. Non-relevant items are pieces about general “social” issues or labor/Arbeitsmarkt policy that use the words sozial/Arbeit without analyzing social work, or texts that only name Soziale Arbeit in passing (e.g., as a keyword) without substantive treatment. Edge cases include critiques of “social work” by non-professional actors (e.g., far-right “sozialarbeiterische” activities) which are relevant if they analyze implications for the field, and documents in English are acceptable if they are clearly about social work despite the German query.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks a comprehensive overview of Germany’s social welfare system and social policy, tracing their historical development, legal foundations, and major programs (health, pensions, accident and unemployment insurance, social assistance). They also want access to statistical tables and surveys on beneficiaries, financing, contribution rates, and social outcomes such as inequality, labor market dynamics, and quality of life.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “soziale arbeit” when it addresses the practice and delivery of social services, the client groups and settings of social work, or the legal and organizational frameworks that govern it (for example Sozialhilfe and Grundsicherung under SGB XII/SGB II, Jugendhilfe, Pflegeversicherung, Asylbewerberleistungen, or “Soziale Infrastruktur und soziale Dienste”). Parts of this text are relevant because they compile data and history on Germany’s welfare systems and social services, including tables on Sozialhilfe, Jugendhilfe, family policy, care for the elderly, and the social service infrastructure that social workers operate within. Content focused mainly on social insurance financing, contribution rates, accident insurance, labor court statistics, or the professionalization of physicians and industrial workplace studies is non-relevant unless it clearly links to social work practice, clients, or service provision. Edge cases include historical overviews of social policy (Bismarckian laws, Weimar/BRD reforms) or surveys on inequality and older people’s living conditions, which become relevant when used to contextualize mandates, needs assessments, or interventions in social work but are otherwise peripheral. Highly relevant documents provide micro-level details on service users, eligibility, casework processes, and the roles of agencies like Jugendamt or Jobcenter; largely non-relevant ones stay at macroeconomic indicators or sectors unrelated to social services.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants a summary of survey items and public attitudes regarding the Wahlalternative Arbeit und soziale Gerechtigkeit (WASG) and the PDS — specifically questions about their planned alliance/merger into Die Linke, which side would have more influence, and whether the joint party would do well in elections. They also seek related opinions on social class and attitudes toward Germany’s social market economy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "soziale arbeit" when it directly treats social work as a profession or field—covering topics like Sozialarbeit/Soziale Arbeit curricula, job roles (Sozialarbeiter/in), case management, client interventions, community or youth work (Jugendarbeit), Sozialgesetzbuch practice, service descriptions, or research and evaluations of social work programs. Relevant signals include exact phrases ("Soziale Arbeit", "Sozialarbeiter"), practical examples, training requirements, service delivery details, or discussion of professional ethics and methods. A document is non-relevant if it only uses the adjective "soziale" in political slogans or party names (e.g., "soziale Gerechtigkeit", "soziale Marktwirtschaft", WASG/PDS/Die Linke) or discusses social class ("soziale Schicht") or electoral alliances without any connection to the practice or profession of social work. Edge cases include policy or election texts: these are partially relevant only when they explicitly describe impacts on social work practice, funding, or regulation; otherwise they should be treated as irrelevant. Finally, watch for ambiguity where "Arbeit" means employment rather than the discipline—context and collocations (capitalization, adjacent terms like "Studium" or "Sozialarbeiter") decide relevance.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking German-language, validated survey instruments and documentation guidelines for social work/social science research, covering a wide range of psychosocial constructs (e.g., social desirability, self-monitoring, workplace stressors, distributive justice, recognition needs, environmental norms, sensation seeking, procrastination). They want tools, short forms, and evidence on reliability/validity for use in written and mixed-mode surveys, panel studies, and egocentric network name generators.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to “soziale arbeit” when it addresses the profession/discipline of social work in Germany—e.g., practice settings, client assessment, community integration, policy, or interventions—and explicitly links tools or findings to social work tasks. For example, content on neighborhood social control/openness and integration of Muslim immigrants, mapping egocentric support networks, or assessing social stressors at the workplace can be relevant if positioned as resources for casework, community work, or occupational social work. Psychometric catalogs (e.g., social desirability, sensation seeking, procrastination, distribution justice scales) or survey documentation guidelines are non-relevant if presented purely methodologically without application to social work practice, education, or policy. Edge cases include items that use “soziale” language (e.g., “soziale Attraktivität,” “Arbeitsorientierung”) but concern general psychology or labor studies; these are only relevant if the document shows how social workers would use the measures for client assessment, program evaluation, or service design. Conversely, research in sociology that informs anti-discrimination or empowerment work in communities becomes relevant when it offers actionable insights or tools for social work contexts.</narr>

<title>soziale medien</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking academic, research-based insights into the roles and impacts of social media—especially in Germany—covering defense communication (Bundeswehr), political campaigns, extremism and “dark” platforms, identity and cultural change, media trust, and health communication. They want overviews, frameworks, and empirical findings that explain how social media shapes discourse, legitimacy, and prevention/education efforts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it centrally examines social media platforms, practices, or effects—using terms like soziale Medien/soziale Netzwerke or naming specific platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Telegram, VKontakte, Gab)—and provides substantive analysis such as policy, communication, or behavioral impacts. Examples include studies of the Bundeswehr’s social media communication, analyses of “dark social media” and extremist use of Telegram or fringe communities, election campaigning via social networks using GLES data, or experiments about responsibility framing on Instagram. Documents that discuss “media” in general (press, TV, audiovisual media, media privatization) without a clear focus on social networking functions, or that only mention social media in passing, are non-relevant. Edge cases include blogs and forums (often counted as social media if user-generated and networked), messaging apps (Telegram/WhatsApp) which are relevant when treated as social platforms, and broad mediatization or media literacy pieces that are only weakly relevant unless they explicitly analyze social media’s distinct affordances and uses.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks empirical studies or datasets about social media usage and its effects—especially on political information, discourse, credibility, hate speech, and polarization—as well as government communication on social platforms. The focus is largely on Germany and Europe and also includes the use of social media within digital learning contexts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is highly relevant to the query “soziale medien” when it substantively discusses social media platforms, usage, attitudes, or effects—for example, studies of intensive social media users, platform rankings (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, YouTube, WhatsApp), hate speech experiences, credibility of information in social networks, or political information behavior on these platforms. Content analyzing policy or civic communication in or about social media (e.g., government information offers on social networks, regulation of online harassment, or the ValCon project on social media and populism) also fits well. Partial or marginal relevance occurs when social media is only one item in a broader “digital media” or education survey (e.g., lists of tools where Facebook/Twitter/Instagram are mentioned among many apps) or when social media appears as one of several crisis information channels in a disaster study. Non-relevant documents focus on unrelated media or topics without a clear social-media angle—such as general media use (radio/TV/print), video gaming habits without social platforms, or legal/professional surveys that mention “Mediennutzung” but not social networks. Edge cases include texts using synonyms like “soziale Netzwerke,” discussions that use only platform names without the phrase “soziale medien” (still relevant), or documents where “soziale” and “Medien” appear separately without referring to social media (not relevant).</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for survey-style information about social media as an information source — specifically how often people use social platforms, blogs and forums to follow current events and politics. They also want related public-opinion items about media coverage, media influence on political attitudes, trust in reporting, and topical media debates (e.g., scandals, right‑wing extremism, gender‑inclusive language).</desc>
	<narr>This document is highly relevant to the query "soziale medien" because it explicitly and repeatedly asks about using "Soziale Medien, Blogs und Foren" (e.g. Facebook or Twitter) as information sources and how many days per week respondents use them for current events and political topics. It appears to be a survey instrument (ZA5573, repeated items) so it is especially useful for research on social-media use frequency, civic/political information behavior, and media effects. Parts of the paragraph that focus on traditional media coverage of specific politicians (Friedman, Wulff, Steinbrück), gendered language, right‑wing extremism, or the social market economy are less relevant if you are only interested in platform features, user interaction, or technical/social network analysis. Edge cases: the document is still partly relevant when social media is one variable among many in a broader media-attitudes questionnaire, but it is not helpful if you need platform‑technical details, moderation policies, or English-language materials.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly addresses social media (soziale Medien) usage, access, effects, or measurement—such as the GLES 2021 pretest modules on social media, politics, and society. It is also relevant if it measures communication via internet-based services or platforms as part of media use (e.g., items capturing access, use, and personal network size for internet-based services in the Information Flows and Trust Levels project). Non-relevant content includes scales on social desirability, social inequality, neighborhood control, workplace social stressors, or teacher self-concept “Medien” competencies, since these are not about social media platforms or behaviors. Edge cases are “soziale Netzwerke” used in the sociological sense (ego-centered networks) or references to “Medien” in the context of mass media coverage of surveys—these share terms with social media but are different phenomena unless explicitly tied to online platforms. Likewise, studies that merely use online methods (e.g., web probing) are not about social media unless they analyze platform-based content or interactions.</narr>

<publication>
	<desc>The user is looking for sociological research on social networks, including theoretical frameworks, measurement approaches (e.g., egocentric networks), and the distinction from social support. They want empirical findings on how networks influence outcomes across domains like entrepreneurship, health, migration, labor markets, aging, and social work, with emphasis on German studies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it centrally examines “soziale Netzwerke” in the sociological or social-media sense—defining networks, analyzing their structure or function, or reporting empirical findings about how ties among individuals or organizations affect outcomes. Examples include studies of entrepreneurs’ networks and gendered differences in self-employment success, qualitative or egocentric network methods (e.g., ALLBUS ego networks, network maps in neighborhoods), or research on network effects in health, employment, aging, or migration (including analyses that use platforms like VKontakte as data sources). Methodological debates distinguishing social networks from social support, or theoretical treatments of network identity, roles, and expectations are also relevant when “soziale Netzwerke” is a core focus. Non-relevant are items where “Netzwerke” refers to non-social systems (computer/electrical networks), where the term appears only tangentially or metaphorically, or content focused solely on individual factors without relational structures. Edge cases include documents about “soziale Medien” (usually relevant), policy or organizational networks between actors (relevant), the film “The Social Network” (relevant only if used to discuss networks), and pieces on social support that do not engage with network structure (often not relevant unless the distinction is the topic).</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks empirical studies and survey data on social networks/social media, including usage frequency and purposes, device preferences, credibility/trust, and interactions with political content. The focus is on how network ties shape information behavior, political attitudes and participation, and social integration, with consideration of demographics and government communication channels.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to “soziale netzwerke” if it focuses on social networks, whether as online social media (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, YouTube, WhatsApp) or as interpersonal network structures in sociology (ties, homophily, diffusion, support). Highly relevant cues include detailed treatment of usage frequency, purposes, devices, political information encounters, credibility and fake news, and government communication on social platforms, all of which appear here. Also clearly relevant are empirical analyses of offline networks—such as school-class network co-evolution (CILS4EU), social support and integration among DDR migrants, American city friendship and association networks, ISSP modules on social relationships, and measures of network size, contact frequency, and tie characteristics. Borderline cases are studies where social networks are only a small subsection (e.g., broader media or gaming surveys that merely include a short “social network” battery), while non-relevant items would use “Netzwerke” in a purely technical sense (computer networks) or mention the term without substantive analysis. Overall, this document is highly relevant because it centers on social networks across multiple contexts—social media and offline relational networks—with rich, concrete variables and outcomes.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The query seeks details about survey items (ISSP 2017) asking which political parties contacted respondents via social networks (e.g., Facebook) — listing parties like CDU/CSU, SPD, AfD, NPD, FDP, Greens, Pirates and “other” — along with related questionnaire instructions (how to answer, navigation) and variables for social class scoring.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant when it explicitly addresses "soziale Netzwerke" as online platforms or as survey items asking whether respondents were contacted by parties via sites like Facebook — for example, questionnaire text listing parties (CDU/CSU, SPD, AfD, Grüne, FDP, PIRATEN, NPD) or variable codes such as v121a/v121d that map to those items. Text that contains the ISSP label, respondent instructions for the social networks module, or the exact question wording ("Von welchen Parteien wurden Sie über ein soziales Netzwerk ... kontaktiert") is a strong signal of relevance. A document is non-relevant if it only uses the words "soziale" or "Netzwerke" in unrelated senses (e.g., "soziale Marktwirtschaft," social safety nets, or professional networks) and never refers to online/social-support networks or political contact. Edge cases include materials about offline social support networks (which may be relevant if the search intent is broad), metadata or code lists with no question text (marginally relevant), and noisy OCR duplicates or repeated boilerplate (relevant but lower quality); clarifying user intent (online platforms vs. social support) helps decide borderline cases.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is looking for research methods and tools to study social networks, especially measuring egocentric networks (name generators, survey items, ECN/RDS approaches) and practical guidelines for recruiting participants via social networking sites like Facebook and Instagram.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it treats “soziale Netzwerke” as either interpersonal network structures or online social network sites—for example, egocentric network name generators, measures of network size, methods that combine ECN with respondent-driven sampling, or guidelines for recruiting via Facebook/Instagram ad targeting. It is also relevant if it surveys network members or provides concrete operationalizations of network constructs (e.g., prompts about people one shares specific social situations with). By contrast, texts that only address general “social” constructs without network structure—such as social desirability scales, anomie, workplace social stressors, attitudes toward social inequality, or evaluations of social policy—are non-relevant. Edge cases include uses of “Netzwerk” to mean an institutional or research network (e.g., the PIAAC Leibniz network) without analyzing interpersonal ties, and studies on neighborhood “social openness/control” or intergroup contact motives that discuss social relations but do not model ties or platforms, which would be at best borderline. Mentions of social media are relevant only when they detail platform-based recruitment, targeting parameters, or sampling flows on SNS.</narr>

<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks a synthesis of research on stress that compares psychological self-reports with physiological markers (e.g., salivary cortisol), examines effects on memory and health, and explores occupational and family stress across diverse groups. They also want insight into measurement tools and paradigms (e.g., PHQ-9, CES-D, KOSS, ISSL, TSST/VR) and broader sociological or state-level patterns to inform more comprehensive stress assessment and prevention.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly examines stress—psychological or physiological—its measurement, causes, moderators, or consequences. Studies measuring cortisol or using stress inductions (e.g., Trier Social Stress Test/VR variants), occupational stress in teachers, nurses, firefighters, or drivers, sociological stress indices, or family/parenting stress predicting youth outcomes are good examples. Papers assessing closely linked constructs such as perceived stress, workload, coping strategies, psychosomatic complaints, or stress effects on memory and performance also qualify, provided stress is a central variable. Non-relevant items only mention stress tangentially, focus solely on downstream conditions (e.g., depression) without assessing/manipulating stress, or use “stress” in other senses (e.g., mechanical stress). Edge cases like null correlations between self-reported and physiological stress, duplicated abstracts, or VR paradigms that fail to elicit cortisol are still relevant when the study’s aim is to induce or measure stress.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks datasets and studies measuring perceived stress and stress-related behaviors across populations—especially hospital employees—and contexts such as work, family, health, and COVID-19, to understand stress levels, determinants, coping, and outcomes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly measures, analyzes, or reports on psychological or occupational stress as an experienced burden, typically via variables or scales (e.g., degree of perceived stress, individual reaction to stress at work, job/ward stress averages). Strong matches include surveys of hospital employees’ work stress, COVID-19 supplements capturing stresses, health surveys with perceived stress by problems and feelings, family/child-related stress, and stress in school or work contexts, as well as “conduct in stress situations.” Content is also relevant when stress is tied to specific contexts or behaviors, such as stress from commuting routes, menstruation-related stress, stress from intoxicant use or gambling, and work stress alongside satisfaction. Non-relevant material uses “stress” only as a verb meaning emphasize (e.g., “stressing positive characteristics” of coin designs) or mentions stress in passing without measures, variables, or analysis. Edge cases are broad, multi-topic datasets; they count as relevant when they include explicit stress items (e.g., perceived stress scales, job stress, work stress and satisfaction) but not when they describe unrelated domains without operationalizing stress.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for the exact survey question wordings, variable codes, and response options used to measure job-related stress (e.g., "My job is rarely stressful" and "How often do you find your work stressful") and frequency of using the internet for anxiety/stress information across ISSP waves. They want to identify and compare these items (and their dataset IDs) across different years.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it contains survey items or questionnaire text that directly measure stress — for example single‑item measures like "My job is rarely stressful," frequency items such as "How often do you find your work stressful," or questions about looking online in the past 12 months for "information related to anxiety, stress or similar problems," and/or if it cites ISSP question codes (e.g., ZA1840 Q17c, ZA3090 Q15c). Exact phrasings, screening instructions (e.g., "IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY WORKING FOR PAY"), and time frames (past 12 months) are particularly useful because they match the query’s content and response-context. Non‑relevant documents include those that only mention the word “stress” in other domains (mechanical stress, engineering stress tests), that discuss unrelated constructs (e.g., general job satisfaction) without measuring stress, or that contain only metadata or duplicate lines without the item text. Edge cases: synonyms and closely related terms like "anxiety" or "tension," translated versions of the same items, and surveys with different response scales are typically relevant, while documents that only tangentially reference mental health without explicit stress items are borderline. Documents repeating the same item many times add little extra value, but should still be flagged as relevant if they reproduce the target questions verbatim.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking information on validated instruments to measure stress and related constructs in social science and occupational contexts, especially scales grounded in Lazarus’s transactional stress model. They want details on dimensions, psychometric properties (e.g., Rasch scalability, reliability/validity), and applications such as teacher/nurse workload, irritation, and stress tolerance.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “stress” when it treats stress as a psychological or occupational construct, such as discussing the Lazarus transactional stress model, measuring experienced stress with validated scales (e.g., Rasch-scaled instruments with reported reliability like .93–.94), or describing related phenomena like psychophysical overload, cognitive/emotional irritation, mental impairment, and stressors in work contexts (teachers, nurses). Content that operationalizes stress in surveys (e.g., scales for perceived workload, stress tolerance, or facets linked to stress) is also relevant, especially when it details development, reliability/validity, and use in health or organizational research. By contrast, uses of “stress” as a verb meaning “to emphasize” (e.g., advance letters that “stress the importance” of a survey) are not relevant to the stress construct. Edge cases include instruments where “stress” is only a facet name within another primary construct (e.g., a curiosity scale listing “stress tolerance”): this is weakly relevant unless the text actually analyzes stress as such. Similarly, mentions of “stress” in unrelated domains (mechanical stress, financial stress tests) or purely metaphorical uses should be considered non-relevant.</narr>

<title>soziale mobilität</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking research-based information on social mobility—its concepts, measures, and theories—and empirical findings on intergenerational mobility and perceived status change. The focus includes links to spatial/job mobility, migration and precarious digital labor, and impacts on lifestyles and inequalities in Europe, especially Germany.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it treats soziale Mobilität as changes in social position or stratification—e.g., vertical up- and downward mobility, horizontal moves, inter- or intragenerational mobility—and discusses mechanisms such as education, occupation, class/schicht, or habitus (for instance, ALLBUS-based status-attainment studies or Bourdieu-informed models of lifestyle and origin effects). It also counts as relevant when mobility is linked to biography, migration, or multilocal living and explicitly connects spatial mobility to social outcomes, such as analyses of transnational biographies, refugee trajectories, university access, or the ambiguous status of Instagram influencers where “horizontal mobility” challenges meritocratic narratives. Documents comparing parents’ and children’s positions, examining perceptions of upward/downward movement, or mapping how precarious, feminized, or platform labor reshapes status are squarely on-topic. Non-relevant are pieces where “Mobilität” means only physical/transport or commuting (trip counts, car use, travel behavior) without an explicit tie to social status or stratification, though they become relevant if they analyze how spatial mobility produces or constrains social mobility. Edge cases include academic career mobility or elderly mobility: these are relevant only when framed as status change, inequality, or class reproduction rather than mere movement through space.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking research and data on social mobility—definitions and types (occupational, sectoral, regional; inter- and intragenerational), its determinants such as social origin and education, and implications for social participation and societal openness, especially in German and U.S. contexts. They want studies and methods (qualitative and quantitative) that analyze mobility patterns and trajectories over time.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly examines social mobility—such as intergenerational or intragenerational moves between social strata or occupations—and links movements in jobs, sectors, education, or regions to social origin, class position, or prestige (e.g., father–son occupation comparisons, Siegel prestige scores, ARB Survey, NEPS-based analyses). Studies that analyze occupational, sectoral, or regional mobility as pathways of status change, or treat mobility as an indicator of societal openness, are clearly on-target; for example, historical local studies of vertical occupational mobility or work on educational transitions that tie geographic distance to parental education are relevant. Mixed-methods or qualitative work that explores perceived chances of upward mobility, barriers to participation, and coping patterns in disadvantaged strata also qualifies. By contrast, documents that reference “mobility” only as physical relocation, commuting, or resettlement without connecting it to status, class, or social origin are not relevant, nor are bare variable lists without analysis of stratification dynamics. Edge cases include datasets or replication files that are relevant only when they accompany analyses of status movement, and studies of geographic mobility that count if they explicitly demonstrate consequences for educational or labor-market returns by social background.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The searcher wants a clear overview of "soziale Mobilität" — what it means (ability of individuals or groups to change social class or status), how it is measured (intergenerational vs. intragenerational mobility, indicators like education, occupation and income), and what causes, trends, and policies affect it (especially in contexts like Germany). They may also be looking for survey questions, coding schemes, and data used to assess social mobility and its relation to social class and economic outcomes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "soziale Mobilität" if it explicitly addresses movement between social strata — for example studies or survey items about intergenerational mobility, barriers and enablers of upward/downward mobility, measures (education, income, occupation) tracking class changes, or policies intended to improve social mobility. Relevant examples include analyses tying "soziale Schicht" to life-course outcomes, longitudinal data on children’s outcomes vs parents’, or evaluations of programs that change access to education or employment. Non-relevant documents are those about physical movement or disability mobility (e.g., “Bewegungsfreiheit beschränkt”), texts about the “soziale Marktwirtschaft” (social market economy) or political satisfaction measures without linking to class mobility, and administrative/coding templates or repeated boilerplate. Edge cases: a mention of “soziale Schicht” is relevant only if the text discusses transitions between classes or mobility indicators; isolated survey questions about local social problems or party competence are tangential unless they explicitly connect to mechanisms of social mobility.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks information on social mobility—especially upward mobility—in the German context, including how it is measured and what factors influence it. They are interested in methodological issues (e.g., selective residential mobility bias in the Mikrozensus panel) and related constructs such as neighborhood social openness/control, discrimination, social inequality, and socio-political attitudes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses social mobility (soziale Mobilität) as movement in socioeconomic status across or within generations—such as upward/downward mobility, class/income transitions, or educational attainment pathways—and discusses determinants, measurement, or outcomes. Analyses using longitudinal data to estimate mobility or correct biases that affect mobility estimates (e.g., sample selectivity in the German Mikrozensuspanel due to selective residential moves) are directly relevant, as are mentions like Aufstiegsmobilität and Bildungsverläufe linked to status change. By contrast, materials focused solely on räumliche Mobilität (residential moves), psychometric scales (social desirability, workplace stress, authoritarianism, anomie), or general attitudes (inequality, social policy) without connecting them to status attainment or intergenerational mobility are non-relevant. Edge cases include instruments on social networks, neighborhood openness, or contact with outgroups that become relevant only if they are explicitly tied to opportunity structures or mobility processes. Mere occurrence of “sozial” or “Mobilität” without an explicit discussion of socioeconomic status change should not be treated as relevant.</narr>

<title>stress am arbeitsplatz</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks information on workplace stress—its causes (e.g., digitalization, monitoring, workload, role conflict, mobbing, job insecurity) and effects on health, work ability, and work–life balance. They also want evidence-based assessment tools and effective prevention, intervention, and coping strategies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it examines stress specifically in the workplace context—its causes (e.g., surveillance, autonomy loss, role conflict/ambiguity, job insecurity), experiences, consequences (health, performance, turnover), measurement (validated scales for social stressors), or interventions (prevention, mediation, supervision) for employees. Highly relevant examples include studies on digitization leading to technostress and altered work ability, analyses of mobbing am Arbeitsplatz with legal and organizational remedies, reliable instruments to assess social stressors in work groups, and research linking effort–reward imbalance or job insecurity to outcomes like alcohol use. Also relevant are accounts of COVID-era home office stress and work–life balance, clinician communication training that reduces doctors’ workplace stress, and organizational change cases (e.g., flexible manufacturing) that heighten demands and dissatisfaction. Non-relevant items include stress in families or student populations without a workplace link, broad sociological overviews that don’t analyze the work setting, therapeutic methods not tied to job contexts (e.g., horse-assisted coaching), or outplacement discussions centered on business logic with only incidental stress mentions. Edge cases include commuting studies—these are relevant only if they connect commuting to job-related stress or health outcomes—and texts that mention “Arbeitsplatz” but do not analyze workplace stressors, which would be weak matches.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking information on workplace stress, especially psychosocial risks like work-related stress, bullying, and violence, and how organizations manage them. They likely want survey-based evidence (e.g., ESENER) on prevalence, risk factors, employer policies, barriers, and interventions to prevent and address stress at work in Europe.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to “stress am arbeitsplatz” if it addresses work-related stress or psychosocial risks at work, such as time pressure, high workload, overtime, harassment/mobbing, violence, work-life conflict, or organizational measures to assess and manage these risks (e.g., risk assessments, ESENER survey findings, management procedures, and employee participation). Detailed questionnaires or results that measure stress, “Arbeitsbelastung,” “Zeitdruck,” or “psychosoziale Risiken,” and describe interventions or barriers (training, policies, effectiveness) are highly relevant. By contrast, material about unrelated topics (e.g., EU constitution, general ICT use, household income, student timetable stress, general health behaviors) or “stress” in a non-work or non-psychological sense (e.g., mechanical stress) is non-relevant. Edge cases include documents that discuss workplace safety only in terms of physical hazards without mentioning psychological strain (weakly relevant) or texts that merely list “Stress” among many items without substantive treatment (low relevance). Mentions in German synonyms like “arbeitsbedingter Stress,” “Belastung,” and “psychosoziale Risiken” should count, but the focus must remain explicitly on the workplace context.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for information about workplace stress—how often employees feel stressed, whether stress has changed over recent years, and how these factors are measured in surveys (including links with computer/internet use at the workplace).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "stress am arbeitsplatz" when it explicitly addresses stress at work—for example asking how often someone feels stressed during daily work or whether work stress has increased, decreased, or stayed the same. The paragraph contains those exact survey items (e.g., "FÜHLEN SIE SICH … IM STRESS" and "HAT DER STRESS … EHER ZUGENOMMEN/EHER ABGENOMMEN"), so those parts are clearly relevant. Repeated lines about "Halten Sie Ihren Arbeitsplatz ..." or the computer/internet usage questions are only relevant if they are linked to causes or correlates of stress (e.g., stress from computer use or job insecurity); otherwise they are noise. Edge cases include survey metadata and codes (V247, v77) or heavy duplication—useful if you need questionnaire structure but not if you only want substantive discussion of workplace stress. Overall the text is partially relevant: it contains direct stress items but also contains redundant and off-topic material that should be filtered for a focused answer.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking information on workplace stress—particularly social stressors and psychological irritation—and the validated German instruments and surveys used to measure it. They want sources such as the BIBB/BAuA employee surveys and related scales (e.g., Irritation, Human Flourishing, 5DCR, informal workplace learning) that assess stress, well-being, and digital work conditions.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly addresses workplace stress, such as social stressors at work, irritation (between mental fatigue and disorder), or models/measures grounded in the transactional stress model (e.g., scales for cognitive and emotional irritation). Reports from the BIBB/BAuA Erwerbstätigenbefragungen that cover work demands, workload, health impairments, leadership, team work, or home office can be relevant when they assess strain/beanspruchung or stress-related outcomes. Measures like the 5DCR (only its Stress Tolerance facet) or the Human Flourishing Scale are relevant if they are explicitly linked to stress at work or used to evaluate how workplace conditions affect well-being; otherwise they are peripheral. Instruments on informal learning at the workplace are non-relevant unless they analyze how such learning behaviors mitigate or exacerbate stress/strain. Edge cases include ICT-at-work pretests, which are relevant when they probe digital work conditions and associated stress but not when they solely assess skills/usage, and documents where “stress” refers to non-psychological or non-work contexts (e.g., mechanical stress or student stress).</narr>

<title>migration</title>
<publication>
	<desc>Seeks a comprehensive overview of migration, including theories and evidence on forms such as circular, internal, student, and asylum/irregular migration, their drivers (economic, political, environmental), and impacts on development, urban change, and health. Also looks for Europe- and Germany-focused analyses of trends and measurement (stocks vs flows), governance and securitization, and predictive tools for managing migration flows.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it primarily examines human migration—international or internal—its drivers, patterns, policies, or impacts on societies and individuals. Examples include studies of circular migration as a management tool, analyses of internal migration among young Swedes, work on the migration–city nexus, the securitization of migration, or research linking migration background to healthcare use; comparisons of asylum versus total migration, remittances and migration, or definitions of environmental migration also clearly qualify. Historical and theoretical pieces that interrogate categories (e.g., voluntary vs. forced, migration regimes, autonomy of migration) are relevant when they center on people’s mobility and its governance. Non-relevant items would use “migration” for unrelated domains (data/IT migration, animal migration), mention it only in passing, or invoke it metaphorically without analyzing human movement; by contrast, documents in other languages about Migrantenfamilien or service access remain relevant because their core focus is human migration. Method-heavy evaluations (e.g., predictive tools, flow vs. stock models, move-order metrics) are also relevant if they are applied to understanding or governing human migratory flows.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks comprehensive datasets and surveys on migration, spanning migrant demographics, labor migration and return trajectories, integration outcomes and public attitudes, and international migration flow statistics. They want micro- and macro-level data (historical and contemporary, especially for Germany/Europe) to analyze social, economic, and family effects of migration.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “migration” when it addresses human mobility across borders or regions and provides substantive information on migrants, flows, or consequences of migration, such as surveys of migrant workers and returnees, international migration statistics (e.g., Ferenczi & Willcox/NBER–ILO compilations), immigration statistics for Canada, Vienna time-series on migration flows, or German panel studies like GERPS on emigrants/remigrants. Analyses of migration-related subtopics—e.g., the social roles of wives of returned migrants, attitudes toward immigration, migrants’ job satisfaction, political behavior of groups with a migration background, or children’s educational trajectories by migration background—are also strongly relevant, especially when they include measures like duration of stay, reasons for migration, remittances, or integration outcomes. By contrast, content using “migration” in other domains (IT/data migration, animal migration) or sections offering only general demography, health, or environment without a migration component (e.g., hospital or air quality tables unlinked to migrants) is non-relevant. Edge cases include items labeled “population movement” or “foreign persons” that are relevant if they quantify migration flows or biographies, while brief passing mentions of “migration background” or duplicated metadata are only weakly relevant unless tied to concrete migration variables or analyses.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A search for "migration" here seeks public-opinion survey material on migration, especially attitudes toward irregular/illegal migration policy (assistance, burden-sharing among EU members, or national responsibility). It also targets perceptions of EU enlargement’s migration effects — expected scale of migration and whether impacts are positive or negative (jobs, wages, culture, housing, identity, social costs, etc.).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly addresses irregular/illegal migration in the EU context or the expected migration effects of EU enlargement, especially when it discusses the specific survey items and themes seen here (qb8 and Q24 series) such as assistance to member states, cost‑sharing, members handling migrants themselves, and perceived impacts on jobs, wages, housing, culture and national identity. Look for texts that reproduce or analyze the Eurobarometer-style questions, report public opinion results, or assess policy responses (for example a policy brief on cost‑sharing across EU states or a survey report that tabulates responses to Q24A–D). Non‑relevant documents mention “migration” only in other senses (bird migration, internal rural‑urban moves, or immigration outside the EU/enlargement frame), focus solely on legal immigration/asylum law without addressing irregular migration or enlargement effects, or only contain unrelated code lists with no explanatory metadata. Edge cases include datasets or CSV files that contain qb8/Q24 codes but lack a codebook—these are potentially useful but need the questionnaire to be interpretable—and translations or duplicated questionnaire text, which are relevant if they preserve the meaning of the survey items but less so if they are garbled or truncated.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it addresses human migration or immigrant/refugee contexts, such as classifying “migration background,” measuring integration, identity, discrimination, health, or belonging among migrant populations. For example, reports on the German Microcensus 2005–2009 immigrant background classification, or studies validating ethnic/national identity (MEIM-R), Everyday Discrimination Scale, SF-12, or a Challenged Sense of Belonging Scale in German/Arabic/Dari among migrants and refugees, clearly match the query. Methodological pieces that provide SAS/SPSS/Stata code to classify immigrant background are also relevant because they enable migration research, as are psychometric analyses (reliability, measurement invariance) conducted specifically in migrant samples or international students experiencing cross-cultural loss. Non-relevant items include uses of “migration” in unrelated domains (data/software migration, bird or cell migration) or studies where “migration” is only mentioned in passing without analysis of migrant status, integration, or related outcomes. Edge cases include general health or belonging measures: they are relevant if applied to or compared across groups with and without a migration background, but less so if validated only in the general population without a migration focus.</narr>

They also want to understand consumer protection and data privacy—especially in the EU—and how regulations (e.g., UCPD, PDO/PGI) affect trust, satisfaction, and market outcomes such as cross-border buying.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively discusses consumers, such as their behavior, preferences, trust, protection, purchasing patterns, or the policies and market practices that affect them (for example, studies on EU consumer protection, analyses of “Mrs. Consumer” buying psychology, or research on packaging effects on consumer choice). Works that measure consumer outcomes like satisfaction, willingness to pay, or logo awareness, or that examine how firms’ actions influence consumer decisions, also qualify. Content focused mainly on producers, firms, or regulation without a clear link to consumer impact, or that only mentions “consumer” in passing, would be non-relevant. Edge cases include terms like consumer surplus in economics (usually relevant if tied to consumer welfare), “consumer data” in privacy contexts (relevant if centered on consumer risks/benefits), or uses of “consumer” in unrelated domains such as ecology or computing message-queue “consumers” (non-relevant). Synonyms such as customer, shopper, or buyer, and plural/singular or historical framings like “Mrs. Consumer,” should count when the focus remains on end-user behavior and welfare.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking empirical survey data on consumer issues—especially awareness and use of consumer rights, trust in institutions, media exposure, product safety, and consumer behavior—primarily in European contexts (notably Poland and Germany) with demographic detail. They also want insights into retailers’ knowledge of and compliance with consumer legislation and obstacles to cross‑border online sales.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly focuses on consumers or consumer issues, such as consumer rights and protection, consumer behavior and education, consumer price indices, or institutions and laws that safeguard or inform consumers. Examples include surveys on Polish consumer rights and media attention to them, evaluations of consumer protection organizations like Federacja Konsumentów, studies of retailers’ compliance with consumer legislation and ADR, and official statistics like the consumer price index for households. Material framed from the business or regulatory side is still relevant when its core is the impact on or treatment of consumers (e.g., monitoring of unfair commercial practices, product safety oversight, or companies’ knowledge of consumer law). A document is non-relevant if “consumer” is merely incidental in a broader topic (e.g., environmental protection without a consumer angle), appears only in metadata, or uses “consumer” in another domain (software queue consumers or ecological food-chain consumers). Edge cases include texts about “consumption” or “customers” without the word “consumer”—these can be relevant if they clearly target end-users/households—and mixed-topic surveys are relevant only when they contain substantial, not passing, modules on consumer matters.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>Determine whether the respondent is currently a member of a consumer association and, if not, collect their specific reasons for non‑membership (e.g., cost, no need, no time, poor service, distance, canceled membership). Also establish whether they have ever asked a consumer association for help and, if not, the reasons for never seeking assistance (e.g., never needed, not useful, no contact, don’t understand, bad service).</desc>
	<narr>A relevant document will explicitly address membership in consumer associations and the reasons people give for not belonging or for never asking such associations for help — for example a survey instrument, codebook, or report containing items like Q27C/Q33D and response options such as “no time,” “too expensive,” “bad service,” “never needed,” or “didn’t know any.” Documents that simply mention “consumer” in other contexts (consumer electronics, consumer prices, or business-to-consumer markets) or that discuss membership in unrelated organizations (trade associations, unions) are not relevant. Pay attention to phrasing and abbreviations: “CONSUMER ASS” might mean “consumer association” or “consumer assistance,” so texts that clearly use it to list membership/status questions are relevant, while ones referring to assistance programs without membership questions are borderline. Format matters: questionnaires, survey transcripts, frequency tables, and coded response lists are highly relevant examples; news stories or policy analyses are only relevant if they specifically report on reasons for non‑membership or lack of contact. Edge cases include OCR or translation errors that repeat or scramble codes — these can still be relevant if you can map the fragments back to the membership/assistance questions.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “consumer” if it discusses people who buy or use goods and services, their attitudes or behaviors, market dynamics affecting them, or policies/rights concerning them. The provided paragraph is relevant because it examines consumer ethnocentrism, describing a scale that measures consumers’ beliefs about domestic versus foreign products and the economic, social, and moral reasoning behind those beliefs. Documents are non-relevant when “consumer” is used in technical or non-market senses (e.g., software message-queue consumers, the Java Consumer<T> interface, or ecological trophic “consumers”), or as a brand name. Edge cases include terms like “customer,” “end-user,” or “consumption”: these are relevant if they pertain to people purchasing/using products, but not if they refer to resource consumption metrics or medical “consumption.” Empirical studies, surveys, and scales about consumer attitudes (e.g., 15- or 20-item measures) are relevant, while pieces focused solely on producers or macro factors without reference to consumers are less relevant.</narr>

<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks a cross-disciplinary overview of COVID-19, emphasizing data-driven research on how the pandemic and restrictions affected mobility, social values and fear, mental well-being, inequality and trust, and sectoral systems such as marketing, education, transit, trade, and international relations. They want factors influencing infection rates and regional resilience, plus case studies and recovery strategies.</desc>
	<narr>For the query “covid19,” documents are most relevant when COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 is the primary focus—such as analyses of mobility during restrictions in Switzerland, studies linking infection rates to social capital or inequality (GINI), operational responses by transit agencies, or sectoral shifts like digital marketing during the pandemic. Work that examines social or cultural dynamics specifically in the context of the COVID-19 emergency (e.g., changes in Gen Z values, fear narratives that center the pandemic, or educational technology adoption explicitly driven by COVID-19) is also relevant, provided the pandemic is central to the analysis rather than a mere backdrop. By contrast, pieces that only mention COVID-19 in passing (e.g., “post-COVID-19” as a time marker) while focusing on unrelated topics like Chinese foreign policy or Eurasian rail geopolitics are non-relevant, unless they present concrete pandemic effects (for instance, data on rail freight growth during the epidemic). Variant terms and spellings (COVID19, COVID 19, SARS CoV-2, coronavirus) should be treated as matches, and methodological or weekly reports tied to COVID-19 outcomes count as relevant, whereas mere citations or tangential references do not. Edge cases include multi-topic documents where only a section provides substantive COVID-19 analysis (partially relevant) and duplicated or boilerplate text invoking the pandemic without new evidence or detail (non-relevant).</narr>

The information need is to find usable survey data, codebooks and study descriptions for analysing how COVID‑19 affected wellbeing, work, families, solidarity and political opinions.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "covid19" when it substantively studies the COVID‑19 pandemic — for example, surveys, datasets or articles that analyze lockdown effects, vaccination attitudes, contact‑tracing apps, sector closures or changes in employment and wellbeing during specific pandemic waves (e.g., German panel studies March–August 2020, KOMPAKK sector closure data, CoronaWarnApp usage, vaccination panel data). Highly relevant items typically report COVID‑specific variables (time frames, wave/sample sizes, measures of risk perception, trust, solidarity, behavior change, vaccination intent) and provide usable data or codebooks. Documents that only mention “COVID19” in passing, are metadata‑only, or focus on unrelated topics (e.g., general SDG consumer surveys without pandemic modules, preprints about publishing culture that are not COVID‑specific) should be considered non‑relevant. Edge cases include pre‑pandemic datasets used for COVID comparison (partially relevant), restricted/open question data that limit reuse, and multiple versions/translations of the same study (choose the latest complete version for highest relevance).</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "covid19" if it directly addresses SARS‑CoV‑2 or the COVID‑19 pandemic — for example discussions of symptoms, transmission, testing, vaccines, treatments, public‑health guidance, case counts, or variant surveillance. Highly relevant examples include CDC or WHO guidance, peer‑reviewed studies on vaccine efficacy, official local restriction updates, and datasets of confirmed cases; by contrast, social media rumors, opinion pieces without evidence, or documents that merely mention COVID‑19 in passing are less relevant. Non‑relevant documents include unrelated materials that include the string "covid19" in a filename, references, or metadata but whose main topic is different, or content about other respiratory diseases without clear connection to SARS‑CoV‑2. Edge cases depend on user intent and timeliness: early‑pandemic guidance may be historically relevant but clinically outdated, and modeling or preprint studies may be important for research queries yet unsuitable for medical advice. Finally, relevance also depends on synonyms and language (e.g., "coronavirus," "SARS‑CoV‑2") and source credibility — authoritative, recent sources should be prioritized for health or policy queries.</narr>

Concrete signals of relevance include explicit terms and variants (COVID‑19, Covid19, coronavirus, SARS‑CoV‑2), descriptions of pandemic‑specific methods (e.g., web probing of COVID items, video cognitive interviews about pandemic effects), and study timeframes tied to 2020–2021. A document is non‑relevant if it only mentions COVID‑19 tangentially (e.g., in passing as background) or if the token appears in metadata but the content focuses on unrelated topics; such items may be borderline relevant if the pandemic context meaningfully shapes the research design. Edge cases include translated items (German originals with English translations) where the translation quality affects keyword matching, and documents about other epidemics that compare to COVID‑19 — these are relevant only when the comparison substantially involves COVID‑19.</narr>

<title>covid</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an overview of COVID-19, emphasizing research on public health measures and vaccination alongside the pandemic’s wider social, economic, and political impacts and policy responses across countries.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “covid” when it substantively discusses COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) itself or its consequences, such as spread, behavioral measures, vaccination, health risks, and societal, economic, or political impacts. For example, studies on risk-group adherence to masking and distancing, links between social exclusion during containment and radicalism, determinants of vaccination uptake in Germany, marketplace policies in Ghana, Japan’s “Jishuku” approach, or analyses of FDI, tourism, digital inequality, and regional security under COVID-19 are all clearly relevant. Content focused on adjacent domains remains relevant if it is explicitly anchored to COVID-era measures or outcomes (e.g., work-life balance during lockdowns, survey practices used to track pandemic attitudes, or microsimulation of pandemic income supports). Non-relevant items would only name “COVID” in passing as a timestamp without analysis, use “pandemic” generically with no clear tie to COVID-19, discuss other diseases, or use “COVID” as an unrelated acronym. Edge cases include variant spellings (“COVID 19,” “Covid-19,” “coronavirus”), discussions of “long COVID,” comparative pieces where COVID is one of several crises (relevant if COVID-specific evidence is provided), and methodological papers that are relevant only if their design or findings are explicitly about COVID-related data or outcomes.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user wants information on COVID-19-related surveys and longitudinal studies—especially in Germany and the EU—covering behaviors, attitudes, compliance with regulations, vaccination views, and socioeconomic and health impacts. They seek datasets/study documentation with details on target populations, sampling, modes, and survey waves/time frames.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses the COVID-19 pandemic (SARS‑CoV‑2), such as surveys or analyses of behaviors, health, socioeconomic impacts, compliance with regulations, vaccination attitudes, or lockdown effects. In this paragraph, items like TwinLife’s 2020–2021 COVID-19 supplemental waves, the U COMPLY panel on adherence to COVID-19 rules, the EU “Women in times of COVID‑19” survey, the ENTRA additional COVID-19 module, and forsa’s repeated population surveys on the “Corona crisis” are all clearly relevant. Content that only describes general study designs, twin genetics, or immigrant integration without linking outcomes to the pandemic would be non-relevant for the query. Edge cases include documents that use related terms (Corona, pandemic, lockdown, vaccination status, non‑compliance) without the exact string “covid” which should still count as relevant, while mentions of “Corona” in non-pandemic contexts or mere date markers like “during COVID” without substantive COVID-related measures would not. Repetition of the same COVID survey description is still relevant but adds no additional unique value.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>A summary of survey items asking respondents how the COVID-19 pandemic changed their confidence in government and the health care system, their employment and household income, how often they meet family and friends in person (before vs. now), and their attitudes about whether people who caught COVID-19 were careless.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it contains the specific COVID survey items or close variants of them: questions about whether the country’s handling of the pandemic changed confidence in the government or health care system (Q30a/Q30b), comparisons of current work activity and household income to pre‑pandemic levels (Q31/Q32), frequency of in‑person meetings with family or friends before vs now (Q33, including TW/Taiwan variants), and attitude items such as “Most people who tested positive for Covid‑19 contracted the virus because they were careless” (Q34b). Exact question codes (v64–v70, Q30–Q34), labels like OPT/OPTIONAL, and answer formats (increased/decreased/about the same; more/less/about the same) strengthen relevance because they indicate the document is the survey instrument or raw dataset. Partial matches — for example an article about COVID economic impacts or a clinical paper mentioning “confidence in government” without the survey phrasing or pre/post comparisons — are less relevant. Edge cases include documents that use synonyms or different punctuation (Covid-19, COVID19, “pandemic handling”), translated versions, or duplicated question blocks (repeats of items) which should be considered relevant if the core item text and response options are present; purely clinical, virological, or news content that lacks these survey items is non‑relevant.</narr>

	<desc>Seeks information on a student course evaluation questionnaire developed/used during the COVID-19 pandemic to assess digital teaching, including its use at WWU Münster and suitability for digital and hybrid formats.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “covid” if it explicitly references COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus pandemic, or pandemic-driven changes (e.g., lockdowns, remote or hybrid teaching), even when COVID is not the primary topic. The provided paragraph is relevant because it ties a course-evaluation questionnaire to digital teaching introduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic and situates it in pandemic semesters (summer 2020, winter 2020/21, summer 2021). Documents that only mention general teaching evaluations without linking them to COVID-related changes would be non-relevant, as would uses of “covid” as an unrelated acronym or mentions limited to metadata or boilerplate. Edge cases include variant spellings or synonyms (COVID 19 with a space, Covid-19, Corona pandemic) and incidental mentions like “COVID-era” timing; these are relevant but weaker than content that analyzes impacts, policies, or outcomes directly tied to COVID. Content about post-COVID adaptations or Long COVID also counts if the connection is clear; vague or offhand references without substantive linkage do not.</narr>

<title>culture</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks academic perspectives that define and theorize culture and examine how cultural identity is constructed and negotiated—particularly in Europe—amid diversity, globalization, and social change. They want surveys and case studies spanning cultural areas, policy, and cross-cultural comparisons informed by sociology and cultural studies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “culture” when it substantively engages with culture as a social or humanistic concept—defining it, theorizing it, or analyzing cultural identities, practices, institutions, and change. Examples include discussions of European cultural identity and border areas, surveys of Simmel’s writings on culture, analyses of globalization’s effects on Taiwanese or Caribbean cultures, or studies of business/organizational culture and cultural trauma. Review essays and methodological pieces in cultural studies, cultural history, or cultural geography also qualify because they synthesize or operationalize “culture” across cases. Non-relevant items include occurrences where “culture” appears only as boilerplate (e.g., a series title) or in non-humanistic senses like cell/microbial culture; edge cases are literary works or policy texts that mention “culture” tangentially (e.g., a Ministry of Culture) without analyzing cultural phenomena, which would be weakly relevant at best. Given the query’s breadth, documents spanning subfields such as popular culture, identity formation, and cultural inequality are relevant, but mere keyword repetition without substantive content should not qualify.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks an overview of empirical studies and survey data on cultural education and participation, especially in Germany, covering digital transformation (e.g., in public libraries), parental influences, municipal funding, and patterns of cultural engagement across arts and media. They want to understand how these factors shape access, participation, and policy in culture.</desc>
	<narr>For the query “culture,” documents are most relevant when they substantively address cultural practices, education, participation, institutions, values, or media representations, not just mention the word in passing. Examples of high relevance include surveys on how public libraries shape digital cultural education, panel studies of cultural participation across music, film, literature and gaming, or analyses of municipal funding and coordination of cultural education—like the library digitization study, the KuBiPaD panel, and the cities’ financing survey described here. Mixed-topic social surveys are relevant if the culture modules are detailed and central (e.g., EU polls on cultural activities, values, and access), while items where “culture” is incidental—such as a transport or poverty report with a single question on museum visits—are borderline; documents using “culture” in a different sense (cell culture in biology or brief corporate-culture slogans) are non-relevant. Edge cases include locality studies where culture is examined via media narratives about rural areas or youth-leisure research tied to cultural activities (e.g., FDJ-related cultural engagement), which are relevant when they provide definition, measures, services, or outcomes. Overall, depth and specificity to cultural content and policy make a document more relevant, whereas bare methodology, demographic tables, or tangential uses of the term reduce relevance.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A concise description of survey information on "culture": the user needs measures of cultural engagement (e.g., how often people use the Internet for cultural purposes), attitudes toward immigrant assimilation versus cultural retention, and which specific cultural or ethnic groups respondents associate with the phrase "people with another culture" (listing many named groups).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "culture" when it contains substantive content about cultural practices, identity, attitudes or behaviours — for example survey question wording about using the Internet for cultural purposes, statements on whether immigrants should retain or adopt a country's culture, or enumerations of specific cultural/ethnic groups (e.g. North African, East European, Buddhist/Hindu). Listings of variable names or codes (v177, v197, qb5) can still be relevant if they accompany clear question text, response options or results, but isolated variable IDs with no context are of low relevance. Edge cases include texts that use the word "culture" in a different domain (e.g. bacterial culture) which would be non-relevant, or documents that only repeat noisy or duplicated lines — those lower the document’s usefulness even if the topic is on-point. In short, preference should be given to passages that explain cultural concepts, survey questions, findings or examples, while excluding uninterpreted metadata, irrelevant domain usages, or purely duplicated content.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks resources on cross-cultural survey methodology and measurement, including questionnaire translation, web probing, sampling/harmonization, and validated scales for cultural intelligence, acculturation, cultural capital, national/political pride, religiosity, and related attitudes. They want evidence on reliability, validity, and measurement invariance across languages and contexts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “culture” when it engages culture as a social or intercultural construct—e.g., acculturation (host vs. origin cultures), cultural intelligence, cultural capital, national/cultural pride, or cross-cultural measurement and translation—and uses terms like intercultural, cross-cultural, socio-cultural, or cultural orientation substantively. Studies that validate scales across languages or groups and explicitly model cultural processes (Berry’s acculturation model, cultural metacognition, multicultural experience) are highly relevant, as are guidelines on cultural adequacy in questionnaire translation and harmonization for cross-cultural surveys. Content is only weakly or not relevant when “culture” appears incidentally (a funding body named “Ministry of Science and Culture,” a family-climate subscale labeled “intellectual cultural orientation”) or when methods like sampling are discussed without a cross-cultural focus. Measures of religiosity or attitudes toward foreigners become relevant if framed as cross-cultural beliefs or contact with other cultures, but not if they treat religion or politics without a cultural dimension. Edge cases include uses from other domains (e.g., cell culture in biology) or superficial “cultural adaptation” that merely localizes wording; these should be excluded unless the text analyzes cultural constructs or intercultural comparability.</narr>

	<desc>Find research on occupational stress across occupations and settings—especially nursing—covering comparative stress levels, key stressors (e.g., workload, environment, commuting), and outcomes such as health complaints, burnout, performance, and turnover. Identify evidence-based assessments and interventions or coping strategies to mitigate work stress.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it addresses stress that arises in an employment or job context—using concepts like occupational stress, job stress, workload, work environment, or work-related strain—and examines its causes, effects, or interventions. Examples that fit include comparisons of stress in inpatient vs. outpatient nurses, studies of bus drivers’ job stress, hospital nursing stress and its health impacts, commuting-to-work unpredictability as a stressor, and postdocs’ work stress linked to turnover intentions. Intervention papers tied to workplace outcomes (e.g., expressive writing reducing exhaustion, stress affecting motivation and performance in hospitals) are also relevant. Non-relevant items include uses of “stressed” meaning “emphasized” or “work” meaning a body of writing/art (e.g., analyses of Gramsci and Bakhtin’s works), or discussions of stress unrelated to employment. Edge cases include commuting stress only if explicitly tied to work, domestic or student “work” that may not qualify as employment, or documents mentioning only one keyword without a clear work-stress linkage.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking information on work-related stress and working conditions, including surveys or measures that capture hours, shift work, job demands, and commuting stress. They also want related variables and outcomes such as health complaints, job satisfaction, and family/housing context across different occupations and study waves.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to “stress work” when it discusses stress in the context of employment or the workplace, such as perceived work stress, job stress scales, workload or deadline pressure, shift or night work, overtime, commuting stress to and from work, and health complaints occurring during or after work. Examples that strongly match include sections on “working conditions and stress at work,” “deadline stress,” “lifting heavy loads, noise, hazardous materials,” “perceived change of work stress,” “mobbing,” “psychological and physical disturbances to health from work,” and ward-level job stress among hospital employees. Content is borderline but potentially relevant when stress is tied to employment indirectly (e.g., “stress from the route to work,” stress among professional drivers due to achievement pressure, or stress from household work if framed as occupational labor). By contrast, material on family or partnership problems, stress from children, menstruation complaints, sexuality, housing satisfaction, leisure culture, or general health behaviors is non-relevant unless explicitly linked to work conditions. Edge cases: synonyms like job strain, occupational stress, workload pressure, and burnout are relevant, whereas “stress tests,” material/engineering stress, or school-only stress are not.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for survey items and variables that measure work-related stress—e.g., frequency of finding work stressful and agreement with “my job is rarely stressful”—and related employment characteristics (occupation, company size, hours worked, employment status) and help-seeking (internet use for anxiety/stress). The likely goal is to locate and compare these questionnaire items/variable codes across ISSP waves to analyze prevalence and correlates of job stress.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "stress work" if it explicitly measures or discusses work‑related stress — for example by containing survey items like "How often do you find your work stressful?" (Q13b v31), "My job is rarely stressful" (v47 Q15d), or related variables that contextualize workplace strain such as hours worked, occupation, and company size. Documents that only tangentially touch stress (e.g., a question about general anxiety or internet searches for anxiety information, Q12b) are partially relevant because they may reflect coping or help‑seeking tied to work stress, whereas documents about stress in non‑work domains (family stress, engineering "stress tests", medical stress reactions) are not relevant. Metadata lists of variable codes or duplicated question texts are relevant for mapping or harmonization tasks but may be non‑informative if they lack the actual item wording or response data. Edge cases to watch for include questions about working during summer holidays (relevant if the item links to workload or stress), variations in phrasing ("stress at work" vs "find your work stressful"), timeframe qualifiers (e.g., "past 12 months"), and false positives where the word "stress" appears in unrelated contexts.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user wants resources for assessing workplace stress, specifically validated survey instruments and scales (e.g., Lazarus-based) that measure dimensions like workload, irritation, and working atmosphere, with information on their reliability and use in social science or occupational health research.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it addresses psychological stress in the workplace—its measurement, antecedents, or consequences—such as scales capturing occupational stress, perceived workload, psychophysical overload, irritation, burnout-like symptoms, or work–family conflict, especially when grounded in models like Lazarus’s transactional stress model. Examples include instruments assessing nurses’ subjective workload (coordination/information problems, psychophysical overload), teachers’ experienced stress shaping teacher–student interaction, or occupational health questionnaires measuring cognitive and emotional irritation and psychosomatic complaints from ongoing work stressors. Content that links stress theory to job contexts, even if focused on psychometrics (e.g., Rasch scalability, reliability/validity), is also relevant. Non-relevant items include uses of “stress” as “emphasize” (e.g., advance letters that “stress” survey importance), constructs where “stress” is incidental or unrelated to work (e.g., curiosity “stress tolerance”), work attitudes without a stress focus (alienation from work, pay satisfaction), or technical guides unrelated to workplace stress (e.g., YouTube Data API, data merges). Edge cases are documents discussing general stress models with no job application, or work-related behaviors like procrastination that may relate to stress but are not explicitly framed as work stress; these require explicit linkage to occupational stress to count as relevant.</narr>

<title>climate change attitudes</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks comparative evidence on what shapes public attitudes toward climate change, how these attitudes differ across countries, and how they translate into policy support and individual actions. They are interested in factors such as political identity/ideology, education, prosperity, trust, gender, and media influences, with findings from large surveys (e.g., ISSP, Eurobarometer) highlighting contrasts among Anglophone, Western European, and post-Communist contexts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it examines people’s beliefs, perceptions, concern, or polarization about climate change and the factors that shape them, or how these attitudes influence behaviors and policy support. Strong fits include survey-based analyses (e.g., ISSP, Eurobarometer) that test predictors such as political identity, free-market ideology, education, trust in government, prosperity, or gender, cross-national comparisons (Anglophone vs Western Europe vs post-Communist states), and studies of the attitude–action gap. Work that links media or education to shifts in climate attitudes (e.g., film effects, classroom interventions) or that shows how climate concern predicts specific actions (energy saving, transport, food choices) is also relevant. By contrast, pieces focused mainly on climate science, technology, emissions, or organizational adaptation without measuring attitudes, or on general environmental or biodiversity attitudes with no explicit climate-change comparison, are non-relevant. Edge cases count as relevant if they connect behaviors or adjacent issues to measured climate attitudes (e.g., food purchasing framed as climate mitigation, country-specific case studies, or dataset introductions that report climate-attitude items and trends).</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is looking for survey-based insights on public attitudes toward climate change and climate protection, including perceived risks, support for and awareness of specific policy measures, energy transition assessments, and personal behavior changes. They seek data—primarily from Germany and the EU—with demographic breakdowns to compare opinions across actors, sectors, and policies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it measures people’s beliefs, concern, or judgments about climate change and climate protection, including attribution (human-caused vs natural), perceived risks, and support or opposition to specific policies. Clear examples include surveys on opinions of a CO2 tax, motorway speed limits, kerosene taxes, higher VAT on meat, coal phase-out timelines, EV subsidies and charging expansion, individual actions (eating less meat, flying/driving less), willingness to pay higher energy prices, and confidence in the energy transition. Also relevant are attitudes toward which actors should do the most (government, industry, citizens), perceptions of lobbying’s influence on EU climate policy, trust in institutions on climate, and self-reported climate-friendly behaviors. Non-relevant are documents that only present climate science, emissions data, technology assessments, or policy descriptions without public opinion, as well as general political/economic surveys lacking a climate-attitudes component or pages with only demographic/method metadata. Edge cases: broader environmental-attitudes or transport/energy-transition studies are relevant if they explicitly capture opinions or behavioral intentions linked to climate change, while modules on biodiversity or chemical product safety are out of scope unless directly tied to climate change attitudes.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A summary of public opinion about which actors within the EU are seen as responsible for tackling climate change (e.g., national governments, the European Union, businesses/industry, regional/local authorities, individuals, “all of them,” “none,” or “don’t know”). The query appears to refer to survey variables and responses to the question “In your opinion who within the EU is responsible for tackling climate change.”</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant when it reports or analyzes public attitudes about who should be responsible for tackling climate change within the EU — for example survey results, tables or commentary showing how respondents allocate responsibility to national governments, the European Union, businesses, regional/local authorities, individuals, “all of them,” or “none/don’t know.” Highly relevant items will include the question wording, response categories (as shown here), response distributions, comparisons across countries or demographic groups, and any interpretation of what those patterns mean. Documents are not relevant if they only discuss climate science, mitigation technologies, legal instruments, or EU policy mechanics without any measurement of public opinion, or if they concern non-EU populations; a bare list of variable codes with no frequencies or explanation is of limited relevance. Edge cases: a raw questionnaire or codebook is partially relevant because it shows question wording and response options, while a methodological paper about survey design is useful for assessing data quality but does not itself describe attitudes unless it reports results.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks research and data on how people think and feel about climate change, including how these attitudes are measured, what factors influence them, and how they vary across groups and over time. They may also be interested in links between attitudes, communication exposure, and pro-environmental behaviors.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly measures or analyzes attitudes toward climate change, such as belief in human-caused warming, concern or risk perception, and support for mitigation/adaptation policies, or if it examines drivers of these attitudes (e.g., media exposure, values) using surveys, experiments, or behavioral data. In this paragraph, the web-tracking guide could be marginally relevant only when it explicitly studies climate change communication’s effects on attitudes, and the brief scale on awareness of consequences for global environmental changes might serve as a proxy for climate attitudes if tied to climate-specific items or outcomes. By contrast, instruments about gender role attitudes, family/organizational/teaching “climate,” authority, acculturation, welfare state views, managerial practices, and occupational class schemes are non-relevant, as “climate” here denotes social environment rather than climate change. Edge cases include methodological resources that do not report attitudes themselves but provide tools or datasets that could infer climate attitudes; these count only if applied to climate topics or accompanied by attitude findings. Passing mentions of climate change or general methods (e.g., LLM overviews, EGP class coding, life events) without a clear link to climate change attitudes should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>

It covers public trust in climate science, communication and media dynamics, equity/responsibility metrics, aid and policy effectiveness, activism, adaptation and risk communication, migration and security framings, gender perspectives, and determinants of pro-environmental behavior.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “climate” when it substantively addresses Earth’s climate system or climate change—its science, impacts, equity, policy, communication, or behavior—rather than merely mentioning the word. Examples of clear relevance include surveys of trust in IPCC projections, evaluations of whether climate aid drives climate legislation, analyses of climate equity using cumulative emissions indicators, studies of climate activism and risk communication, or links between climate literacy and migration intentions. Content is non-relevant when “climate” is used in another sense (e.g., “organizational climate” in schools or workplaces) or when the term appears only in passing without analysis of climatic phenomena or responses. Some items are partially relevant, such as media or political discourse during COP meetings or national securitization debates (e.g., Japan), which still center on climate communication and policy. Edge cases include non-English sections that match the topic but may be less usable, duplicated passages that add no new information, and methodological critiques that remain relevant if they explicitly assess climate outcomes (e.g., data quality in climate aid and policy measures).</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is looking for survey-based insights on public attitudes in Germany toward climate change and climate protection, including concerns, responsibility of different actors, and support for specific policies (e.g., CO2 tax, transport, energy, building measures). They want representative study results with demographic breakdowns and methodological details from recurring government-commissioned polls.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “climate” when it substantively addresses climate change or climate protection, such as public attitudes, policy measures, mitigation and adaptation strategies, or the energy transition. This includes surveys or analyses discussing actors’ roles (government, industry, citizens), sector contributions (transport, energy, buildings, agriculture), and concrete measures like CO2 taxes, electric vehicle subsidies, speed limits, kerosene taxes, or public-transport tickets (e.g., the Deutschlandticket). Content that only mentions “climate” tangentially—such as administrative survey metadata, coding variables, or unrelated policy areas (health technology assessment, GDPR) without a clear link to climate policy—would be non-relevant; likewise, uses of “climate” as a metaphor (business climate, political climate) are not relevant. Edge cases include documents focused on natural disasters or flooding that explicitly connect impacts to climate change (relevant), or mixed-topic datasets where a substantial module analyzes climate policy or lobbying’s influence on EU climate policy (relevant), even if other modules are unrelated. Brief, passing references to climate without analysis, findings, or policy context would not meet the bar for relevance.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The query seeks to determine which actors within the EU people consider responsible for tackling climate change. It aims to summarize survey responses assigning responsibility to entities like national governments, the European Union, businesses/industry, regional/local authorities, individuals, others, or combinations/none/don't know.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "climate" when it explicitly discusses climate change—particularly who is responsible for tackling it within the EU—and lists actors or response options such as national governments, the European Union, businesses/industry, local/regional authorities, individuals, "all of them", "none", or "don't know". For example, survey questionnaires, poll results, or analytical articles that include the repeated question "In your opinion who within the EU is responsible for tackling climate change" and associated coding labels (qa3, qb3, qc3, V565, etc.) are highly relevant because they show how responsibility is framed and measured. A document is non-relevant if "climate" appears in a different sense (e.g., organizational or workplace climate), or if the text only contains noisy metadata or isolated codes without any substantive wording or responses. Edge cases include repeated or corrupted question strings: duplicated question text and code lists may still be useful if you need the questionnaire instrument or variable mapping, but are less useful if you need analyzed responses or interpretive commentary. Finally, relevance increases if the document situates the discussion in the EU context; otherwise a general climate-change piece outside the EU is only partially relevant.</narr>

	<desc>The user is looking for how "climate" is defined and measured in social science research—covering family, teaching, and organizational climate scales—and how climate-related topics (e.g., climate change communication) can be examined using web tracking data.</desc>
	<narr>This document is relevant if “climate” refers to psychosocial or organizational climates, since it details instruments that measure family climate (e.g., positive emotional climate, active leisure, organization, control, intellectual-cultural orientation), teaching climate (social relations, aggression against the teacher, cooperation, disciplinary violations, emotionality), and an Occupational and Organizational Climate Index (BOKX) that captures meaning and competence. It is also relevant to readers seeking methodological guidance on web tracking as a research method, with a minor example that such data can be used to study climate change communication. However, it is largely non-relevant for users seeking information on meteorological or environmental climate, such as greenhouse gases, temperature trends, climate modeling, or adaptation/mitigation policy. An edge case is a user interested specifically in “climate change communication” methods: the guide provides a conceptual pathway via web tracking but does not focus on climate science or communication theory in depth. Conversely, a user looking for validated scales or short screening tools for classroom, family, or workplace climate would find highly pertinent, actionable detail here.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks scholarly, interdisciplinary resources that define and theorize violence (including physical, structural, cultural, and epistemic forms). They want analyses of how violence manifests and is experienced across diverse contexts—animals, gender, racism, family, schools, work/care, queer communities, and refugee settings—along with data, frameworks, and responses.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively engages the German concept of Gewalt—defining it, debating its scope (e.g., physical versus structural, cultural, or epistemic violence), or analyzing concrete contexts such as domestic/family violence, school violence, racist or gender-based violence, queer anti-violence work, or violence against animals, and uses related compounds like Gewalthandlungen, Gewaltschutz, Gewaltforschung, or Anti-Gewalt. Relevance increases when the text details forms and practices of violence, social mechanisms that sustain or normalize it, historical developments, victims’ perspectives, and prevention or policy frameworks (for example, the Istanbul Convention or hate-crime research). Documents are non-relevant if they only mention the word in passing (e.g., in bibliographies or lists of chapter titles) or use it in unrelated fixed expressions such as Gewaltenteilung, höhere Gewalt (force majeure), or the adjective gewaltig. Metaphorical or extended uses like epistemische Gewalt can still be relevant if they analyze harm, power, and social relations rather than invoking the term as a loose flourish. Edge cases include multilingual pieces that discuss “violence” without the German keyword, or texts about physical “force” in science; these are generally non-relevant unless they explicitly connect back to the social-scientific notion of Gewalt.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking studies and survey data on violence (Gewalt) that cover prevalence and forms (domestic/gender-based, youth/school, political/xenophobic), perpetrators and victims, health and social impacts, reporting behavior, risk factors across demographics, and prevention/policy measures. Focus is on Germany and the EU, including trends since reunification and in conflict-affected contexts.</desc>
	<narr>The German keyword “Gewalt” (violence) makes a document relevant when it substantively treats violence as a topic—e.g., prevalence, forms (domestic, sexualized, school, political/xenophobic), perpetrators and victims, attitudes and norms toward violence, causes, prevention, reporting behavior, health impacts, or policy responses. Studies or surveys describing modules on häusliche Gewalt gegen Frauen, Gewaltbereitschaft, Gewaltanwendung an Schulen, Gewalt gegen Ausländer, sexual harassment, stalking, or victimization are clearly relevant, even if listed among many other themes. Content that only name-drops “Gewalt” in a long keyword list without analysis is weakly relevant, while texts using near-synonyms like Übergriffe, Misshandlung, oder Viktimisierung can still be relevant if they clearly address violent acts. Non-relevant hits include homographs and idioms such as Gewaltenteilung (separation of powers), höhere Gewalt (force majeure), or the adjective gewaltig (huge), as well as general political or EU topics that lack a violence component. Borderline cases include defense or security-policy discussions that mention violence only tangentially; they become relevant when they assess experiences, risks, or measures related to violent acts.</narr>

	<desc>A concise summary of survey materials on "Gewalt" (violence): the user is looking for questionnaire items, response categories and some frequency data about various forms of violence—youth violence, violence against police, school violence, political violence (e.g., Joschka Fischer), and opinions on blame in the Israel–Palestine conflict—along with coding labels used in the survey. The underlying need is to locate the exact question wordings, response options and summary counts/labels for research or analysis of public attitudes toward violence.</desc>
	<narr>Relevant documents explicitly mention or measure "Gewalt" (violence) in substantive contexts — for example questions or results about Gewalt gegen Polizisten, Gewalt von Jugendlichen, Gewalt unter Schülern, or Gewalt im Nahen Osten, or tables that report survey responses (F.124, F.64A/B) about who is to blame or whether violence is acceptable. Documents that include the questionnaire wording, prevalence statistics, or detailed discussion of causes and consequences are highly relevant because they directly address the query term. Non‑relevant documents merely containing the token "gewalt" as part of a code label, OCR artifact, repeated header, or in a different compound sense (e.g. "Gewaltenteilung" = separation of powers) are not useful. Edge cases include negated mentions ("keine Gewalt"), morphological variants and synonyms (gewalttätig, Gewalttaten, Gewaltbereitschaft) which should be treated as relevant, while mentions in other languages or as incidental list items with no substantive content should be treated with caution.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is looking for validated German-language measurement scales related to violence, including pro-violence attitudes, violent behavior and self-reported juvenile delinquency, authoritarian and Machiavellian dispositions, and teachers’ bullying-related self-efficacy. They want instruments (largely from the University of Bielefeld’s “Youth and Violence” projects) with information on development and psychometric properties.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “gewalt” when it directly addresses violence as a phenomenon, attitude, or behavior—such as discussing approval of physical force, violent acts, or instruments that measure violent tendencies. For example, descriptions of scales assessing violence-supportive attitudes, youth violent behavior (e.g., against persons or property), or self-reported delinquency that explicitly includes violent offenses, as well as studies from projects like “Jugend und Gewalt,” are clearly relevant. Content on related constructs (e.g., authoritarian or Machiavellian orientations) is relevant only when these are examined in relation to violence (prediction, correlation, or intervention); purely theoretical treatments without a violence link are less relevant. Bullying/mobbing measures count if they address violence in school contexts (e.g., teacher self-efficacy in handling student bullying), whereas general self-efficacy not tied to aggression is not. Edge cases that are non-relevant include uses of “Gewalt” in other senses (force majeure, separation of powers) or mere name-drops without substantive discussion; mixed-offense delinquency scales are marginally relevant if the violent component is explicitly represented in items or findings.</narr>

<title>care arbeit</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an overview of care work (Care-Arbeit) in Germany/Europe—what it is, why it is undervalued, and how gender relations, welfare-state policy, neoliberal restructuring, professionalization/digitization, and migration-driven care chains shape it. They also want evidence and policy approaches to improve pay, rights, and gender equality across paid and unpaid care.</desc>
	<narr>For the query “care arbeit,” documents are relevant when they treat caregiving as work (Care-Arbeit/Sorge- oder Pflegearbeit), whether paid or unpaid, and analyze its organization, conditions, remuneration, regulation, or gendered distribution. Examples include studies of Pflegeberufe, 24-hour live-in care by migrant women, “global care chains,” professionalization/marketization of the care sector, union strategies, wage comparisons, or welfare-state and feminist-citizenship debates that recast care as civic duty or labor. Theoretical or empirical pieces qualify if the labor dimension is central, e.g., Nancy Fraser’s “universal caregiver,” value theory explaining the devaluation of care, or the impact of digitization on training and careers in care occupations. Non-relevant items use “care” in unrelated senses (self-care, NGO/brand “CARE,” environmental care) or discuss health services/family relations without framing caregiving as labor, as well as texts that mention “Arbeit” generally but never caregiving. Edge cases: German synonyms (Sorgearbeit, Pflegearbeit) and mixed-language titles are relevant; pieces expanding “care” to nonhuman nature or purely moral-philosophical ethics are only marginal unless they connect back to the work, pay, or policy of care labor.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking information on care work (Care-Arbeit), particularly unpaid family caregiving and children’s assistance with household/family care. They are interested in how these responsibilities were experienced or distributed during the COVID-19 period in Germany (and possibly Ghana).</desc>
	<narr>For the query “care arbeit,” documents are relevant when they address care work (Care-Arbeit) such as unpaid family caregiving, childcare, eldercare, domestic care tasks, or paid care labor, including how these duties are distributed, experienced, or supported. In this paragraph, the World Vision Children’s Study explicitly mentions “assistance with family care work” during the COVID-19 crisis, which is directly relevant; mentions of “Betreuung der Kinder” (childcare) can also be relevant if tied to caregiving responsibilities or burdens. By contrast, materials about general work or labor statistics, home office and work addiction, wage and hours indices, or job satisfaction are non-relevant unless they link specifically to caregiving or domestic care responsibilities. Mentions of “health care,” Electronic Health Care Records, or the NGO “CARE” are likely false positives unless they explicitly discuss caregiving work and its performance. Edge cases include references to “Hausarbeit” or family versus work comparisons, which are relevant only if they analyze the performance or load of care/household work rather than mentioning it in passing.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The query seeks survey items about work and care-related topics—employment status and arrangements, working conditions (time pressure, workplace location, working with others), job satisfaction, reasons for part-time work, responsibility for other employees, and whether one would continue working if financially secure. It also includes related sociodemographic and attitudinal questions such as having a driver’s license, confidence in the health-care system, perceived likelihood of detection for drunk driving, and evaluations of political parties' performance.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "care arbeit" if it specifically addresses care work or the care sector — for example nursing, eldercare, childcare, health-care employment, working conditions in care jobs, job satisfaction of care workers, or comparisons between public- and private-sector care employment. Items that simply mention unrelated survey topics (driver’s licenses, drunk-driving detection, party performance, or general political questions) are not relevant. Relevant examples include a survey question about confidence in the health care system, reasons for part-time work in nursing, or whether people would prefer to keep working in a care role if financially independent; non-relevant examples include questions about having a driver’s license or police detection of drunk driving. Edge cases to watch for are mixed survey instruments that bundle care-related questions with many unrelated items (those can be partially relevant), and language ambiguity (German “Arbeit” or English uses of “care” in non-care contexts like “take care”) which can produce false positives.</narr>

	<desc>The query seeks information on the German “Who cares” project examining care work for dependent persons, particularly estimating the prevalence and conditions of foreign/undocumented caregivers in private households using the Person Count Technique and a web-probed cognitive pretest. It also asks about the survey instruments employed, including German versions of standard psychometric scales (e.g., work orientation, procrastination, sensation seeking, social desirability, environmental norms, health anxiety, aggression, job satisfaction, awareness of consequences).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it discusses care work (Care-Arbeit) in the German context, especially caregiving for dependent persons in private households, whether paid or unpaid. It becomes highly relevant when it uses terms like Fürsorgearbeit/Pflegearbeit, pflegebedürftige Personen, ausländische oder illegale Pflegekräfte, or describes methods to study hidden care labor such as the Person Count Technique, cognitive online pretests, or web probing. By contrast, material that primarily lists psychometric scales (e.g., procrastination, sensation seeking, aggression, general job satisfaction) without a clear link to caregiving or care labor practice is non-relevant. Edge cases include false positives about customer care/IT support or jobs at the NGO CARE (“CARE Arbeit”), while broader analyses of eldercare/childcare policy or unpaid domestic care in Germany remain relevant even without exact keywords. Clinical “patient care” content is only borderline relevant unless it explicitly addresses caregiving labor or household-based care arrangements.</narr>

<title>gesundheit</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks a scholarly overview of the concept of health, contrasting functional and subjective health and integrating biomedical, biopsychosocial, and salutogenic models. They want evidence on how aging, gender/cohort, socioeconomic inequality, migration, work conditions, and crises (pandemics, war) affect health, along with implications for public health policy and the right to health.</desc>
	<narr>For the broad keyword “gesundheit” (health), a document is relevant when it substantively discusses health concepts, indicators, outcomes, or systems—such as definitions of health, epidemiology, public health, clinical versus preventive approaches, or measured changes in physical, mental, or subjective health. Examples include analyses of functional vs. subjective health across aging and gender, cohort trends, links between income/wealth inequality and health, workplace health promotion, migration-related health access, pandemic effects, or debates over the WHO health definition. Interdisciplinary, historical, legal, or policy treatments (e.g., Asklepios/Hygieia as health concepts, the right to health, health system resilience in crises) also count if health remains the primary focus. Non-relevant are texts where “Gesundheit” is only incidental or formulaic (a sneeze response), a brand or proper name, or a metaphor unrelated to human health (e.g., “the health of the economy”), or documents about other topics that only mention health in passing. Edge cases like health insurance or wellness marketing are relevant only if they assess effects on health outcomes; duplicates or literature reviews still qualify, while purely economic or demographic pieces must explicitly connect their analysis to health indicators to be considered relevant.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks comprehensive, survey-based information and datasets on health and healthcare—particularly in Germany and Europe—covering occupational safety and psychosocial risks, public health behaviors and attitudes, healthcare systems, and health expenditures. They are interested in sources, methodologies, and variables from studies such as ESENER, ISSP, Eurobarometer, and national panels.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “gesundheit” if it substantively discusses health, healthcare, or health-related topics, including public or occupational health, individual health behaviors, health systems and insurance, health expenditures, or policy (e.g., surveys on workplace safety and psychosocial risks like ESENER, datasets on German health expenditures, ISSP Health modules, studies on AIDS prevention, environmental impacts on health, or local “Gesundheit und Pflege” needs in aging). Keyword and compound matches in German such as Gesundheitswesen, Gesundheitsschutz, Gesundheitsausgaben, Gesundheitsversorgung, and related terms like Pflege, Krankenversicherung, Prävention, oder Arbeitsschutz strengthen relevance, as do sections on mental health, SRHR, or preventive screenings. Mixed-topic surveys remain relevant if they contain a clearly described health module or analysis, even when health is only one of several themes. A document is non-relevant if “Gesundheit” appears only as a passing value in a list (e.g., a generic ranking of life priorities), as the sneeze exclamation “Gesundheit!”, in brand/place names containing “gesund,” or in safety/finance texts without a concrete health angle. Edge cases include economic or legal reports that qualify only when tied explicitly to health spending, services, or outcomes, and materials in which “gesund” (healthy) is used adjectivally without meaningful health content.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The querent is looking for phrasing about self-rated general health and perceived health risks (e.g., spoiled meat, BSE, avian flu, coronavirus). Likely this is for survey questions asking respondents to rate their overall health and whether specific outbreaks or hazards threaten their health.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "gesundheit" when it centers on health topics—explicit German terms like gesundheit, gesundheitszustand, or health-related questions, descriptions, or data (for example, a survey asking "Wie würden Sie Ihren Gesundheitszustand im Allgemeinen beschreiben?" or paragraphs about BSE, Vogelgrippe, or Coronavirus). Text that contains substantive discussion of conditions, risks, preventive measures, health status codes, or survey instruments is strongly relevant; repeating questionnaire items or explanatory passages about illness clearly qualify. Documents are non-relevant if the word appears only incidentally (e.g., as an interjection "Gesundheit!" after a sneeze), in unrelated brand names, or as isolated codes or metadata with no health context. Edge cases include compound words and inflected forms (gesundheits-, gesundheitszustand), translations or misspellings—these should be matched and reviewed for context—and long boilerplate repetitions (which are relevant but may add little new information). Prefer documents that provide meaningful content (questions, explanations, statistics) rather than mere token occurrences when deciding relevance.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks information on German health-related surveys and validated measurement instruments, including tools for mental and physical health, workplace psychosocial climate, physical activity/active transport, preventive health behavior, COVID-19 social networks, and well-being/flourishing. They want documentation on instrument development, pretesting, and validation (e.g., work addiction scales, BOKX, PSC, Human Flourishing Scale).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it centers on health (Gesundheit) in German, such as discussing physical or mental health outcomes, behaviors, or measurement tools—e.g., scales for work addiction, Psychosocial Safety Climate, WHO-referenced physical activity, skin cancer screening decisions, or RKI health monitoring. Content linking health to related constructs like well-being (Wohlbefinden/Flourishing), organizational support for psychological health, or survey modules on health within panels (e.g., FReDA, STEP) is also clearly relevant. Multi-topic surveys are relevant when health is a substantive module rather than a passing mention (for instance, questions on patient satisfaction with medical visits or active transport qualify). Non-relevant or borderline cases include documents where “Gesundheit” appears only as a proper name or keyword in a project title without health-focused content, or where the focus is organizational climate or policy reforms with no health dimension. Edge cases include texts that use “Gesundheit!” as an interjection, translations that use “health” without the German term (potentially missed by strict keyword matching), or demographic variables like age discussed without any explicit link to health.</narr>

<title>drug</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is looking for research and analyses on drugs that examine how policy, regulation, and markets influence prices, prescribing, use, and crime across countries, as well as the effectiveness of treatment and public health campaigns. They seek comparative, empirical evidence on approaches like decriminalization, harm reduction, and enforcement and their outcomes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “drug” if it substantively addresses pharmaceuticals or illicit substances in contexts such as pricing and access (e.g., patents raising HIV/AIDS drug prices in low- and middle-income countries), clinical practice (e.g., GPs modifying hospital-prescribed regimens), public policy and law (e.g., Scandinavian drug control differences, decriminalization effects), or prevention/treatment and public health campaigns (e.g., radio/TV anti-drug initiatives). Also relevant are sociological and historical analyses (e.g., the U.S. crack scare, harm reduction vs. prohibition, legalization’s impact on crime), case studies of use and dependency (e.g., heroin use leading to HIV), and security dimensions (e.g., cartel violence and enforcement). Non-relevant items are those where “drug” is only incidental (appearing in references or metadata), used figuratively (“power is a drug”), or appears as an unrelated acronym, or where the study’s focus lacks medication or substance-use content. Edge cases include single-substance or distribution-focused pieces (e.g., thalidomide’s controlled distribution), which are relevant if they discuss regulation, risk, or clinical use; by contrast, materials about “drugstore” retail marketing or fictional scenes of someone being “drugged” would not meet the query’s intent.</narr>

<research_data>
	<desc>The user is looking for survey-based insights on public and youth attitudes and behaviors related to drugs, especially in Germany and across Europe. They want information on prevalence and contexts of use, perceived risks, motives, access, social networks, and opinions on prevention, legalization, punishment, and institutional responses, often alongside alcohol and tobacco.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively discusses drugs in the sense of use, abuse, access, attitudes, policy, or health risks—especially surveys of public or youth opinions, prevalence, motives, and measures to combat drug problems (e.g., personal contact with drug users, perceived availability within 24 hours, legalization debates, testing at school/work, sentencing vs. therapy). Content on specific substances (illicit drugs, “intoxicants,” cannabis, ecstasy, heroin, cocaine) and related topics like alcohol/nicotine as “entry drugs,” risk assessments, and cross-country comparisons are highly relevant. Examples include Eurobarometer modules on why people try drugs, who youths would ask for information, and judgments on the effectiveness of anti-drug campaigns. Non-relevant are pieces where “drug” appears only incidentally or in unrelated senses—such as pharmaceutical marketing, routine medical treatments, or “drugstore” mentions—without discussion of drug use/abuse, policy, or access; likewise, items solely about alcohol/tobacco with no link to illegal drugs may be borderline. Edge cases include AIDS or general health surveys: they are relevant if they address drug use, testing, or policy (e.g., urine tests, harm, dependence), but not if drugs are mentioned only as medications in passing.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for survey-style information about public experiences and perceptions of drugs — e.g., how often people encounter drug-related problems locally, personal contact with addicts, and whether drugs are seen as a workplace or community problem. They also want views on drug addiction’s impacts (social, health, economic, moral, criminal), perceived availability and danger of specific drugs, and awareness of particular substances.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "drug" when its primary content discusses drugs or drug-related issues—e.g., descriptions of drug use, addiction, contact with drug problems, availability (how easy to obtain heroin or ecstasy), public health or workplace impacts, and attitudes toward different drug types. Concrete survey items such as "seeing people dealing in drugs," "finding syringes," "possibility to get hold of heroin," or lists of drug names (ecstasy, cannabis, heroin) are strong relevance signals. Documents are non-relevant when the word appears only as an administrative code, in unrelated contexts (e.g., a pharmacy inventory or a clinical prescription regimen without social/behavioral context), or when the mention is tangential (only paired with alcohol where drugs are not discussed further). Edge cases include noisy or duplicated survey text (repeated prompts that add little new information) and mixed-topic records where drug-related questions are present but buried among unrelated metadata—these are partially relevant and useful mainly for structural or methodological analysis rather than topical content.</narr>

	<desc>Information about how drug offenses are defined and assessed within an adolescent self-report delinquency scale that includes 16 items across theft, property damage, violent crimes, and drug-related offenses.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "drug" if it discusses drugs or drug-related topics, such as drug use, drug offences, controlled substances, medications, or policies and testing around them. The provided paragraph is relevant because it explicitly includes “drug offences” among the crime areas measured by a self-reported delinquency scale. In contrast, content that focuses only on theft, property damage, or violent crimes without mentioning drugs would be non-relevant. Edge cases include texts that use synonyms like narcotics, controlled substances, or medications (relevant), or documents where “drug” appears only incidentally in a footnote or reference list (marginal). Also, uses of “drug” as a dialect past tense of “drag” or in unrelated phrases/brand names should not be treated as relevant.</narr>

<title>ukraine</title>
<publication>
	<desc>A concise, up-to-date overview of Ukraine’s geopolitical and security situation, including EU accession and NATO prospects, Western (EU/US) policies and support mechanisms, and Russia’s ongoing aggression and influence. It also seeks insight into Ukraine’s domestic governance and economic-security reforms, accountability for war crimes, and the implications for European stability.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “ukraine” when Ukraine is a primary focus—politics, war, security, economy, law, or international alignment—and offers substantive discussion, such as EU candidacy and enlargement debates, U.S. and Russian policies toward Ukraine, NATO prospects, accountability for war crimes, IMF support, or Ukraine’s internal legal frameworks for economic and national security. Pieces analyzing how the EU funds Ukraine’s defense, bilateral security assurances, or social and cultural dimensions (for example, the semiotics of maps of Ukraine during wartime) are also clearly relevant. By contrast, texts that only name-drop Ukraine while discussing broad EU fiscal design, generic Russia-West relations, or unrelated regional topics without concrete Ukraine-specific analysis are weakly relevant or non-relevant. Edge cases include comparative studies where Ukraine is just one of several cases (relevant if it gets substantial treatment), articles centered on Crimea/Donbas/Kyiv or the “Ukrainian crisis” without saying “Ukraine” explicitly (topically relevant though a literal keyword match might miss them), and diaspora or historical-nationalism pieces that mention Ukraine—relevant only if they tie clearly to Ukraine’s current policy, security, or societal context.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively focuses on Ukraine—such as the war, its effects on Germany and the EU, public opinion about the conflict, media and information behavior, refugee experiences, and related policies. Examples include the forsa “Crisis Monitor” and Info Markt studies on attitudes toward the Ukraine war, news use and credibility, as well as the EU FRA survey of people displaced from Ukraine and discussion of the Temporary Protection Directive. Material that only name-checks Ukraine within a broad foreign policy or TTIP discussion, or pages dominated by sampling frames and fieldwork logistics without reporting Ukraine-related findings, are less relevant. Edge cases include repeated listings of survey waves that are still relevant if they track Ukraine-related questions, while mentions of Ukraine in long country lists or as a brief historical aside may not meet the user’s likely intent for information about Ukraine itself.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants clarification on how "Ukraine" is represented in the dataset's region and weighting variables (e.g., V231, V252, V253), specifically which country groups include or exclude Ukraine, whether Ukraine's national weight V280 is applied, and how to correctly use those sample weights.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "ukraine" if it explicitly names Ukraine (or "the Ukraine") as a region or country in the dataset, describes weighting variables that include Ukraine’s share of the population (for example V231 Region Ukraine, V253/V252 weight variables that list Ukraine in country group 3 or 4), or gives instructions about using national weights for Ukrainian samples. For example, a paragraph that repeatedly labels "Region Ukraine" or explains that a weight adjusts national samples in proportion to Ukraine’s population is directly on-topic. A document is non‑relevant if it never mentions Ukraine, only discusses other countries, or explicitly sets Ukraine’s weight to zero for a particular variable (in which case it is not useful for analyses seeking Ukrainian-specific weights). Edge cases include passages that mention Ukraine only as one member of a multi-country grouping (partially relevant) and metadata that repeats tokens or uses outdated phrasing ("the Ukraine") or alternative spellings—these are relevant but require careful interpretation.</narr>

	<desc>A general informational overview about Ukraine, including basic facts (location, capital, population), and likely interest in its history, politics, economy, culture, or current events (such as the conflict with Russia) and practical details like travel or visa requirements.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "ukraine" if it substantially discusses the country, its people, places, institutions, events, language, culture, or economy — for example a news report on the Russia–Ukraine conflict, a travel guide to Kyiv, a history of Ukrainian independence, or an economic analysis of Ukraine’s GDP. Relevant documents may use variants and related terms such as “Ukrainian,” “Kyiv”/“Kiev,” “Donbas,” “Crimea,” or Cyrillic spellings (Україна), so these should be treated as matches even if the exact English string isn’t present. Non-relevant documents include items that only mention Ukraine in passing (a long list of countries where Ukraine is one of dozens), use a similar-looking word unrelated to the country (e.g., the phrase “you crane”), or are about a company or product that happens to include “Ukraine” in its name but contains no substantive information about the country. Edge cases include misspellings and transliterations, documents focused on territories or cities that are part of Ukraine without naming the country explicitly, and works that are relevant only to a specific intent (e.g., visa application guides vs. breaking news), so matching intent and depth of coverage is important when judging relevance.</narr>

The goal is to understand how media structures, policies, and digital platforms shape news production, audience relations, and democratic communication.</desc>
	<narr>For the query “media,” a document is relevant when it centrally examines media as communication systems—mass, news, social, or transnational—addressing their structures, performance, policies, economics, audiences, or practices. Examples that clearly match include analyses of social media commodification in Indonesian newsrooms, accounts of media capture in Turkey, studies of media performance in the digital age, work on media concentration/fragmentation and bias, or research on media literacy among youth. Documents are non-relevant if “media” is only a passing mention or used in an unrelated sense (e.g., culture media in biology, mixed-media art techniques, or anatomical references like the tunica media). Edge cases include pieces where “Media” appears only in an organization’s name or where “mass media” is a model parameter; these are relevant only if they substantively analyze media influence rather than merely name it. Given the breadth of the keyword, prioritize topical centrality and depth—documents with “media” in the title/abstract and sustained discussion should outrank general political or sociological texts that mention media incidentally.</narr>

	<narr>For the query “media,” documents are relevant when they discuss mass communication channels (press, television, radio, digital), patterns of media use, audiences, or industry actors such as advertising agencies and media research bodies. For example, the paragraph on AGMA’s Media Analyse describes annual surveys of German media usage, sampling and interview methods, and multiple waves focused on press and electronic media as well as youth media behavior—clearly matching the query. Non-relevant results would use “media” in other senses (e.g., biological culture media, data storage media, or artistic mediums) or as a proper noun/place name without any connection to mass communication. Edge cases include texts where “media” appears only in an organization’s title or in boilerplate repeated text; these are weak or tangential unless they actually analyze media consumption, availability, or advertising contexts. Time-bounded studies (e.g., 1992–2002 waves) are still relevant to “media” broadly, though they may be less suitable if the user’s intent is specifically about current social or digital media trends.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The query seeks survey items about people’s primary and secondary media use (TV, radio, online social media, websites, written press) and their attitudes toward how the media represent diversity (gender, age, disability, ethnic origin, religion/belief, sexual orientation) and the prominence/coverage of researchers and scientific research. In short, it aims to measure media consumption patterns and perceptions of diversity and science coverage in the media.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to this query if it contains survey materials, codebooks, dataset variables, or questionnaire text about media use and how diversity or scientific research are represented in the media — for example QP16A/B items asking which media people use most often (TV, radio, online social media, internet websites, written press) and QC12/QE11 items on whether diversity by age, gender, disability, ethnic origin, religion or sexual orientation is reflected. Documents that explicitly list variable codes (v532, v539, v316, etc.), response categories (e.g. “age under 25,” “none,” “don’t know”), or questions about the place of researchers and research in media coverage are especially relevant. Non-relevant documents mention the word “media” in other senses (e.g. biological growth media, multimedia file formats, marketing media kits) or only use “media” in passing without the survey/diversity context. Edge cases include files with only raw variable codes or repeated noisy text — these can be partly useful if labels or question text can be recovered, but are lower relevance than a clean questionnaire or annotated codebook.</narr>

Topics include visual content analysis, misinformation detection with NLP, web tracking, data linking, algorithmic fairness, media-based empathy measurement, studying vulnerable communities, democracy impacts, and mobile data collection.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “media” when it substantively focuses on communication media—e.g., social media platforms, digital media use, media effects, visual media (images/videos), or measurement of media-related constructs. Highly relevant examples include discussions of analyzing images and videos in political communication, detecting misinformation on social media, web tracking of digital media use, media-based empathy scales (e.g., MBE), and reviews on social media and democracy. Partially relevant are pieces on methods or ethics that apply broadly to online systems but explicitly center their applications in social media contexts (e.g., fairness in socio-technical systems or studying vulnerable communities online), whereas general methodological content without a clear media focus is weaker. Non-relevant results include mentions of “media” only in proper names (e.g., conference titles), incidental subscale labels in unrelated instruments (e.g., “media diagnostics” in a teacher self-concept tool), or false substring matches like “immediate.” Edge cases include uses of “media” outside communication (e.g., biological culture media or brand names); unless tied to communication channels or content, these should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>

They want research and policies on digital inclusion and skills (digital literacy gaps, digital citizenship, inequality), along with frameworks and maturity models and interventions (e.g., EU and library programs) that support equitable participation.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “digitalization” when it examines the systemic adoption and impact of digital technologies on organizations, governments, economies, or society—often framed as digital transformation, digital-by-default public services, digital maturity, platformization, or capability building. Studies on national programs (e.g., the EU Digital Compass or Dutch Digital Inclusion), corporate digital transformation and maturity models, platform ethics and power asymmetries, telework-driven upskilling, or organizational change (including gender dynamics) are clearly relevant because they address the processes and consequences of becoming more digitally organized. Work centered on digital citizenship, digital skills, or digital literacies is relevant if it explicitly links these topics to broader digitalization trends (access to digital public services, participation in a digital welfare state, labor market shifts), but more borderline if it only inventories skills without connecting to transformation processes. Pieces focused on disciplinary labels (e.g., Digital Humanities vs Digital Archaeology) or narrowly technical training taxonomies with no discussion of organizational or societal change are weakly relevant or non-relevant. Edge cases include “digitization” (narrow conversion) versus “digitalization” (transformational change): the former is only relevant when tied to wider transformation, and country case studies or age-related digital inclusion are relevant if they analyze systemic effects rather than isolated tool use.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses digitalization/digitization as a social, organizational, or policy transformation—such as the adoption, use, impacts, strategies, and governance of digital media and technologies. Clear fits include surveys of digital learning in schools, universities, and further education (equipment, OER, e-assessment, blended learning), public services going digital, broadband expansion, data protection and cybercrime, workplace “Work 4.0” changes, and library digital transformation, as well as expert panels on digital privacy. Items focused mainly on EU politics or Brexit are only relevant where they explicitly analyze hopes/fears, policies, or consequences related to digitization; likewise, broad value surveys (e.g., EVS) qualify when they contain modules on internet use or attitudes toward digital tech. Non-relevant materials are those that only list demographics or administrative codes, or that mention digital tools in passing without discussing adoption, effects, or policy tasks. Edge cases: scanning/archiving “digitization” is borderline unless tied to wider digital transformation; synonyms like “digital change,” “digital transformation,” “Industry 4.0,” and “e-learning” also indicate relevance.</narr>

	<desc>User wants to identify and extract measures of digitalization in the ISSP integrated datasets — specifically self‑assessed digital tech skills (in daily life, for current/ future jobs, online learning, use of online public services) and perceptions of digital technologies' impact on the economy, society, and quality of life. They also need the associated metadata and identifiers for cross‑national analysis (CASEID, ISO‑3166 country/subsample codes, year of birth, occupation and sample codes).</desc>
	<narr>This paragraph is relevant to the keyword "digitalization" because it repeatedly mentions digital technologies and concrete survey items about digital tech skills (e.g., "RESPONDENT DIGITAL TECH SKILLS IN DAILY LIFE," "USE ONLINE PUBLIC SERVICES," "DIGITAL ONLINE LEARNING") and about perceived impacts on economy, society and quality of life — useful when the query seeks empirical measures or survey data on digitalization. It also contains dataset-specific metadata (variable names like qd1/qd4, CASEID, ISO country codes, ISSP module years) that makes it especially valuable for researchers who want to locate or reuse survey variables and sampling information. It is non-relevant if the user is searching for conceptual definitions, implementation guides, policy recommendations or case studies of digital transformation, because the text is largely a codebook-style listing and repetitive metadata rather than explanatory prose or practical advice. Edge cases: a document that mentions "digital" only in the context of ID numbers or file formats could trigger the keyword but not actually address digitalization as a social or economic process; conversely, this text might be highly relevant for someone mapping indicators of digitalization but misleading for someone wanting how-to guidance. To judge relevance quickly, prefer passages with survey questions and impact measures for empirical queries, and ignore documents that only contain administrative codes or file-structure details if you need conceptual or applied information.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks an overview of digitalization’s role in social science research and education—methods for collecting, linking, and analyzing digital behavioral data (web tracking, mobile sensing), along with ethical and fairness considerations and applications to health and democracy. They also want validated instruments and classifications suited to digital contexts, such as IDR‑24 for digital readiness, the MBE empathy scale, and occupational/class schemes like ESeC and Blossfeld.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to “digitalization” when it discusses the transformation of practices, services, or research into digital environments, including the skills, infrastructures, and governance needed for that shift. For example, pieces on Individual Digital Readiness (IDR-24) for online teaching, guides to web tracking and mobile sensing, or work on digital behavioral data and associated ethical challenges directly address digitalization in education and the social sciences. Analyses of social media’s impact on democracy, network analysis of online traces, or algorithmic fairness also qualify because they examine societal consequences of pervasive digitalization. By contrast, content on occupational or socioeconomic classifications (e.g., Blossfeld’s scheme, ESeC) is non-relevant unless it specifically treats how those systems are being digitized or used to study digital transitions. Edge cases include documents that merely use digital tools without reflecting on digital transformation, or that mention “digital” only in passing; also, items focused on “digitization” (simple analog-to-digital conversion) may be borderline unless they link to broader organizational or societal change.</narr>

<title>digital</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks a synthesized understanding of digital citizenship, literacy, and inclusion—how these concepts are defined versus practiced, where skill gaps and inequalities persist, and how policies, training, and measurement frameworks can promote equitable participation in digital societies. They also want comparative evidence across contexts (libraries, education, workplaces, EU and Global South) to assess effective interventions and policy–practice misalignments.</desc>
	<narr>For the broad query “digital,” a document is relevant if it substantively analyzes digital technologies, practices, policies, skills, or transformations—ideally signaled in the title, abstract, or section headings. Examples include studies of digital citizenship and inclusion (e.g., librarians’ roles or the Dutch Digital Inclusion programme), work on digital literacies across the lifespan, evidence on digital skills gaps (Global South or youth), organizational or educational digital transformation (VET, telework), and analyses of digital platforms and the digital divide. A document is less relevant when “digital” is only a passing mention, appears solely in a proper noun without accompanying analysis, or the piece focuses on adjacent concepts (ICT, internet use) without engaging the “digital” theme—especially if strict keyword matching is used. Edge cases include fields like Digital Humanities or Digital Archaeology: they are relevant when they discuss digital methods or infrastructures, but less so if “digital” functions mostly as a disciplinary label; likewise, policy items (EU Digital Compass, Digital Poland) are relevant when they detail digital principles, competencies, or implementation rather than merely naming initiatives. Morphological and compound variants (digitization, digitalization, digitally, digital divide, digital maturity) should count as relevant, whereas homonymous uses (e.g., anatomical “digits”) or occurrences only in citations or affiliations should not.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks representative surveys and datasets on digitalization—especially digital learning and media use—in Germany and Europe, covering attitudes, practices, infrastructure, and challenges across education, work, and cultural institutions. They are looking for sources like the Digital Education Monitor, European Values Study, and TAPP Panel that capture public and expert perspectives, including on digital privacy and “Work 4.0.”</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “digital” when it substantively discusses digitization or digital technologies—such as digital learning platforms (e.g., Moodle, ILIAS), e-assessment systems, open educational resources, digital privacy and regulation, or policy and infrastructure topics like fast internet/WLAN expansion and cybersecurity—rather than merely mentioning the word. Materials that center on the “Monitor Digitale Bildung,” digital media in universities and schools, digital testing, libraries’ digital transformation, or Work 4.0 and attitudes toward digitization clearly match the query. Content where “digital” appears only in passing within a broader, unrelated topic (e.g., a survey mostly about EU politics or general values, with a brief nod to digitalization) would be only marginally relevant. Edge cases include “digital” used as a brand name or in non-technical senses (e.g., digits/fingers), which are non-relevant, and long equipment lists (smartphones, projectors, digital cameras) that are relevant only if tied to analysis of digital learning or services rather than cataloging items. Duplicate or boilerplate mentions of “digital” without explanatory context also reduce relevance.</narr>

	<desc>The user wants metadata and definitions for ISSP survey variables about digital technology, specifically respondents’ self‑assessed digital skills (daily life, job, future job, online learning, use of online public services) and perceived impact of recent digital technologies on the economy, society, and quality of life. They also need information on related identifiers and coding (CASEID respondent IDs, year of birth codes, country/ISO and subsample codes, occupation codes) and how these are formatted across ISSP waves.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "digital" when it clearly discusses digital technologies, digital skills, online learning or public services, or measures the impact of recent digital tech on economy, society, or quality of life — for example, a survey codebook defining variables like "RESPONDENT DIGITAL TECH SKILLS" (qd4) or "RECENT DIGITAL TECH IMPACT" (qd1) is highly relevant because it provides content and measurement context. Documents that include substantive discussion, definitions, survey questions, respondent answers, or policy analysis about digital adoption and skills rank highest. Non-relevant items include files that only contain the substring "digital" as part of an identifier or repeated token with no explanatory text, materials about CASEID/ISO codes that are unrelated to technology, or uses of "digital" in other senses (e.g., relating to fingers or the plant digitalis). Edge cases include listings where variable names contain "digital" but lack descriptions (moderately relevant), documents in other languages or abbreviated metadata that mention "digital" only once (low relevance), and false positives like phrases containing "digit" (e.g., "3 digit ISO code") which should not be treated as topical. In short, relevance should be judged by contextual depth and topical focus on digital technologies rather than mere keyword occurrence.</narr>

They also want guidance on ethics and fairness, validated instruments (e.g., IDR-24, media-based empathy), and occupational/socioeconomic classifications (Blossfeld’s, ESeC), with applications to health and democracy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “digital” when its central topic concerns digital technologies, behaviors, data, or methods, rather than merely mentioning the term in passing. Highly relevant examples here include guides on web tracking and mobile data collection, interviews about digital behavioral data for health and fairness in socio-technical systems, and instruments like the IDR-24 for Individual Digital Readiness or student evaluations of digital teaching. Content on media-based empathy tailored to diverse digital media use also directly fits the query. By contrast, sections on Blossfeld’s Occupational Classification, ESeC coding, or microcensus occupational variables are non-relevant unless they explicitly tie those classifications to digital contexts; note the edge case where “three digit occupational variables” contains “digit” but not “digital,” which should not count as a match. Mentions of “digital” only in author bios, event names, or as a passing adjective without substantive discussion should be treated as weakly relevant.</narr>

<title>digital skills</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an evidence-based overview of digital skills—how they are defined and measured, the scale and drivers of skill gaps across countries and demographic groups, and their impacts on work, wages, and inclusion. They also want to know which policies and training approaches effectively build digital skills (e.g., education, broadband access, ICT use, adult learning) to close these gaps.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it defines, measures, compares, or develops digital skills (including synonyms like digital literacy, ICT skills, or digital problem-solving) or links them to outcomes such as employment, wages, inclusion, or education. Strong examples include studies using PIAAC/OECD data to quantify skill levels and gaps (e.g., Global South vs. high-income countries, youth of color, older workers, adults with learning disabilities), analyses of how telework or industry digitalization changes skill demands and rewards, and frameworks showing how ICT use, literacy, motivation, access, and social support shape digital skills. Policy evaluations and methodological work that map occupational digital skill requirements or assess training effectiveness also count, even when using self-reported measures or focusing on specific domains like algorithmic/datafication literacy. Non-relevant items are those that discuss digitalization broadly (infrastructure, broadband, tasks, or technology adoption) without connecting to individuals’ skills, or that use “skills” in unrelated senses; edge cases like health information seeking or civic engagement are relevant only when they explicitly measure digital skills or tie outcomes to skill levels.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking surveys and datasets on digital skills and digitization in Germany across work and education, including competencies, internet use, digital learning practices, and attitudes toward digital change/AI. They want measured results and demographics on literacy and digital consumer competence, workplace impacts (Work 4.0), institutional readiness, challenges, and related policy implications.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly measures, describes, or develops digital skills or competencies, such as tests of digital consumer competence, self-assessments of media or internet skills, training participation in digital learning, or employer demands for digital qualifications. Surveys that evaluate skill gaps, workforce upskilling needs in the context of digitization (e.g., “skills and qualifications for the future world of work”), or the effectiveness of digital education programs also qualify as relevant. Content focused mainly on infrastructure or usage (hardware availability, OER catalogs, platform usage) is only weakly relevant unless it ties usage to learners’ or workers’ abilities and outcomes; for example, a library’s digital transformation becomes relevant if it includes programs that teach digital literacy. Documents about immigration attitudes, EU politics, or general digitization attitudes without a competence component, as well as pure demographic descriptions, are non-relevant. Edge cases include general literacy studies that also report “digital practices and basic skills,” or AI-use surveys that assess capability or training; these are relevant only if they quantify or evaluate users’ digital competence.</narr>

The information need is to locate and understand these digital‑skills items and their coding/availability in the ISSP datasets.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "digital skills" when it explicitly contains measures or question text about individuals' ability to use digital technologies—e.g., qd4 items such as "RESPONDENT DIGITAL TECH SKILLS IN DAILY LIFE," "TO DO JOB," "TO DO FUTURE JOB," "DIGITAL ONLINE LEARNING," or the self‑assessment phrasing "You consider yourself to be sufficiently skilled in the use of digital technologies." Material about the broader impacts of digital technology (qd1 items on economy, society, quality of life) is related but only indirectly relevant unless it also reports on respondents' actual skills. Documents that only contain administrative metadata—CASEID, ISO country codes, year of birth, occupation codes, or repeated variable codes without any skill items—should be considered non‑relevant. Borderline cases include codebooks or survey documentation that list qd4 variable names without item wording (partially relevant) and noisy, duplicated exports where the qd4 items are present but buried among repeated metadata (relevant but lower quality for extraction).</narr>

They also seek expert insights on using web/mobile tracking and digital behavioral data for research, including ethical and fairness considerations when studying vulnerable communities and health topics.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “digital skills” if it directly measures, evaluates, or defines individuals’ competencies for using digital technologies, such as scales of digital literacy/readiness or frameworks assessing skills needed for online learning and work. For example, the IDR-24 on Individual Digital Readiness—with subscales like digital participation, affinity for technology, autonomy, and willingness to learn—is highly relevant, and student instruments that explicitly gauge learners’ ability to navigate digital teaching environments could be relevant if they assess competencies rather than just course satisfaction. In contrast, occupational class schemes (Blossfeld, ESeC), cultural capital via number of books, general self-efficacy, teamwork SJT, need for cognition, cultural intelligence, and media-based empathy do not assess digital competencies and are therefore non-relevant. Method guides and interviews about web tracking, mobile sensing, health analytics, or algorithmic fairness are only tangentially relevant unless they operationalize or validate measures of digital skills (e.g., a digital literacy scale for participants or researchers). Edge cases include course-evaluation batteries focused on digital teaching features or ethics/methods discussions in digital contexts; these should be treated as non-relevant unless they contain explicit constructs, items, or validated scales that quantify digital skills.</narr>

<title>sicherheitsgefühl</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The query seeks research on the public’s sense of security (Sicherheitsgefühl), especially in Germany—how it is defined and measured, how it varies across regions and over time, its relationship to police presence and actual crime, the role of demographics, and implications for policing and public policy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly addresses Sicherheitsgefühl as a subjective sense of safety and examines its determinants, measurement, or consequences—e.g., studies on police presence and perceived safety, fear of crime, demographic drivers, or trends and comparisons across German cities or European countries. Clear examples include randomized or panel surveys linking police presence to Sicherheitsgefühl, critiques of standard “alone at night” indicators, analyses of East–West urban differences, or demographic projections showing how aging populations affect fear of crime. Contextual applications are also relevant when they explicitly connect practices or settings to perceived safety, such as festival awareness concepts, neighborhood dialogue forums, housing conditions shaping residents’ sense of safety, or legal/policy discussions framing the state’s role in protecting perceived security. Documents are only marginally relevant if they mention Sicherheitsgefühl in passing within broader topics (e.g., social justice or party politics) without analyzing its causes or measurement. Non-relevant items include IT/cyber “security” feelings, crime-statistics pieces that never engage with perceived safety, or uses of Sicherheitsgefühl as intra-group cohesion (e.g., biker subcultures) with no link to public safety or crime risk.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is looking for surveys and datasets that measure “Sicherheitsgefühl” (sense of security), including perceptions of personal and public safety, fear of crime, and victimization. They want indicators, trends, and demographic breakdowns, plus related attitudes toward security policies and institutions, primarily in Germany with some comparative contexts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly discusses people’s perceived sense of safety (Sicherheitsgefühl), measures it in surveys, or analyzes factors that influence it, such as fear of crime, victimization, trust in police, or differences by place and time (e.g., daytime vs. nighttime, neighborhood, public transport). Examples include city studies like “Leben in Frankfurt,” national surveys on inner security in Germany, modules on internet security feelings (Sicherheitsempfinden online), or research linking policies (CCTV, airport controls, data retention) to changes in perceived safety. Content in other contexts that still measures the public’s Sicherheitsgefühl—such as studies in Macedonia or Iraq, or Bundeswehr/ZMSBw surveys that include threat perception and safety feelings—also counts; synonyms like “Sicherheitsempfinden” or phrases like “Gefühl der Sicherheit” are relevant. A document is non-relevant if it focuses only on objective security/defense policy, crime rates, or institutional measures without asking about or reporting people’s subjective safety feelings, or if “Sicherheit” appears without any experiential or perceptual dimension. Edge cases include documents that mention the term only in passing (e.g., a long topic list with no results or analysis), purely technical IT-security pieces that lack user feeling measures, or marketing copy that uses “gives a feeling of security” without empirical discussion.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A search for "sicherheitsgefühl" seeks a clear explanation of the subjective sense of safety—what it means, how it differs from objective risk, and the personal, social, and environmental factors that shape it. The user may also want ways to measure or strengthen that feeling and to understand its effects on behaviour and well‑being.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "sicherheitsgefühl" when it explicitly discusses the subjective feeling or perception of safety—for example studies, interviews, surveys, or policy analyses about how people feel in their homes, neighborhoods, workplaces, or on public transport. Relevant material can include research on psychological factors, environmental design (lighting, visibility, urban planning), community measures (neighbourhood watches, policing strategies) or evaluations of interventions that aim to improve perceived safety. Documents that only report objective crime statistics without linking them to residents' perceptions, or that treat "Sicherheit" solely as technical or legal security (e.g., cybersecurity protocols or safety regulations) are generally not relevant unless they address the emotional or perceptual dimension. Edge cases include articles about physical security measures (CCTV, locks) which are relevant if they explore their impact on people’s sense of security, and translated or synonym-using texts (e.g., "sense of safety") which are relevant if the connection to subjective perception is clear. Non-relevant items can also be brand names, product pages, or incidental mentions where the term appears but the document does not examine feelings of safety.</narr>

Also seeking how these survey items were cognitively pretested online using the Web Probing method in the EU AUDITS project to inform local security policy analysis.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "sicherheitsgefühl" if it explicitly studies or measures residents' subjective sense of safety—through surveys, interviews or perceptual indicators—and discusses how those perceptions inform local security policy. For example, texts that report on questions about fear of crime, safety in traffic, or citizens' perceptions of municipal safety work (as in the AUDITS project pretest using cognitive online web probing) are clearly pertinent. Documents that are not relevant include those that only give objective crime statistics, describe technical or IT-security measures, or discuss security policy in purely institutional terms without any attitudinal or perceptual data. Edge cases include papers that use synonyms (perceived safety, fear of crime), related constructs (trust in police, social cohesion) or methodological studies of survey instruments—these can be relevant even if they do not use the exact word "sicherheitsgefühl"—whereas pieces using the term in a different domain (e.g., workplace safety compliance or cybersecurity) may be false positives.</narr>

They want empirical findings across labor, housing, and education—especially affecting migrants and minorities (e.g., Muslims, Roma)—along with the relevant legal frameworks and policy responses in Germany/Europe.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively analyzes, measures, theorizes, or reports on discrimination (Diskriminierung) in social, legal, institutional, or economic contexts, especially in German-speaking settings. Examples include field experiments on hiring bias by ethnicity, phenotype, and religion; surveys of perceived discrimination at universities; studies of housing-market access, price discrimination, and segregation; or work that distinguishes preference-based versus statistical discrimination and examines institutional or intersectional mechanisms. Methodological or conceptual pieces that define discrimination, propose coding schemes for linguistic discrimination, or review legal and policy frameworks (e.g., AGG, ILO reports) are also relevant even if largely theoretical. Documents are non-relevant if they only mention the term in passing, use it metaphorically, or discuss adjacent topics (e.g., general citizenship theory) without linking to discriminatory mechanisms, evidence, or policy. Edge cases include normative debates about “legitimate” versus “illegitimate” discrimination at borders or Gleichbehandlung/Benachteiligung studies that may remain relevant if they explicitly connect to discrimination processes and outcomes, while bare dataset descriptions without discrimination findings would be borderline.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks comprehensive survey-based information on discrimination in Germany and across the EU, including experiences, attitudes, prevalence, and drivers across domains like employment, education, housing, health, and services. They also want comparisons between affected and non-affected groups (e.g., migrants, ethnic minorities, Roma, LGBTI, Jews), awareness of rights and legal frameworks (e.g., AGG), reporting behavior, and assessments of anti-discrimination measures.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses discrimination (Diskriminierung) as unequal treatment or prejudice, especially structural discrimination, including victims’ experiences, perceived prevalence, causes/mechanisms, impacts, coping and reporting, and legal or policy frameworks (e.g., Germany’s AGG). Examples include surveys or studies that measure discrimination in employment, education, housing, health, policing or services; cover targeted groups (ethnic origin, gender and gender identity, age, religion, sexual orientation, disability, Roma, migrants, Jews); and detail forms like material disadvantages, social devaluation, harassment, or physical attacks, along with awareness of rights and support channels. Multi-topic surveys that contain a dedicated discrimination module are relevant when they provide concrete items, variables or findings on discrimination, but are weakly relevant or non-relevant if the word appears only in a list of themes or metadata without substantive content. Non-relevant items use “discrimination” in unrelated senses (e.g., signal discrimination, price discrimination) or focus strictly on other policy areas without discussing unequal treatment of social groups. Edge cases such as studies of observed (not self-experienced) discrimination, antisemitism-focused surveys, or datasets that merely code discrimination variables are still relevant because they operationalize the concept; general social surveys lacking any discrimination measures are not.</narr>

	<desc>The user wants to identify the primary reason for discrimination experienced in their main occupation, corresponding to survey variable EB0215P. They are seeking a concise answer listing or selecting the main motive (e.g., gender, age, ethnicity, religion, disability) that best explains the discrimination.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly contains the EB0215P variable or question text asking “What was the main reason for discrimination in your main activity?” and provides a clear answer or coding for that main reason. Relevant examples include transcripts or datasets that list a respondent’s single primary reason (e.g., gender, ethnicity/race, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, nationality, language, political opinion) or a codebook that defines EB0215P categories and their labels. Partially relevant documents are translations, synonyms, aggregated frequency tables, or metadata that map directly to EB0215P (these are useful but may lack individual-level answers). Non-relevant documents are ones that only discuss discrimination in general, address other survey variables or paragraphs (e.g., EB0216), provide legal/policy analysis without the EB0215P question, or mention multiple causes without identifying which was the “main” reason. Edge cases to watch for include missing/null responses, entries that list several reasons without indicating the primary one, and near-matches where phrasing differs (Hauptgrund vs. Haupttätigkeit) — these reduce relevance unless they clearly tie back to the EB0215P question.</narr>

	<narr>A document is highly relevant if it explicitly discusses Diskriminierung (discrimination), especially in social contexts like neighborhoods, perceived discrimination, or attitudes toward out-groups, as this paragraph does by measuring “Diskriminierung in der Nachbarschaft” within a panel study. Content that operationalizes or evaluates discrimination—e.g., survey items on perceived unfair treatment, social openness, social control, gender equality, or integration of Muslim immigrants—also counts as relevant, including methodological notes like cognitive pretests or web probing used to test such items. Related German terms (Benachteiligung, Ausgrenzung, Vorurteile) and discussions of egalitarian attitudes or pluralism that connect to discriminatory dynamics further strengthen relevance. Edge cases include documents that only mention the word “Diskriminierung” tangentially, use it in a different domain (e.g., signal discrimination in engineering), or discuss social control/openness without any reference to unfair treatment or prejudice—those would be non-relevant.</narr>

They also want policy and practice guidance to shape these outcomes, including curriculum modernization, adult learning, gig-economy regulation, and social safety nets such as basic income.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively examines Digitalisierung as a broad socio-technical transformation—e.g., its impacts on labor markets and Industrie 4.0, democracy and misinformation, education and adult learning, sectoral contexts like churches or public administration, or policy responses such as gig-economy regulation and basic income. Empirical reports, policy analyses, theoretical overviews, and case studies that explicitly frame AI, broadband, automation, or workplace surveillance as parts of Digitalisierung also qualify, including variants like digitale Transformation or the English digitalization/digitisation. Partially relevant items discuss digital tools or corporate communication only insofar as they connect them to systemic organizational or societal change. Non-relevant are pieces that use “digital” merely as an adjective (e.g., devices, scanning documents), fleeting mentions in intros or bibliographies, or promotional content without analytical depth. Edge cases include chapter lists or abstracts naming Digitalisierung without substance, which are weakly relevant, while narrow technology studies are relevant only when situated within the broader dynamics of Digitalisierung.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks empirical studies and monitoring data on digitalization in Germany, covering the status quo, trends, and impacts across sectors (e.g., higher education, work, public administration, culture), along with public attitudes, opportunities/risks, and policy priorities.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it treats Digitalisierung (digitalization) as a central theme—describing status, trends, policies, or impacts in Germany—such as in higher education, public administration, labor markets, or cultural institutions, ideally with empirical surveys, monitoring, or project results. Examples include reports like the Monitor Digitalisierung 360 on universities, studies on e-government services and citizen use, workplace surveys about Arbeiten 4.0, or research on libraries’ role in the digital shift. Materials remain relevant even when Digitalisierung is one module within broader surveys (e.g., Eurobarometer waves, mixed-topic polls on EU and digitalization, or projects that also cover AI/Big Data) if they contain dedicated items, findings, or datasets on digitalization. Non-relevant items only mention the term in passing (e.g., in a funding title or reference list), are duplicates without added substance, or focus on unrelated issues (such as resistant germs) unless they include a substantive digitalization section. Edge cases include metadata-only entries with no content, synonyms like digitaler Wandel or Arbeiten 4.0 that should still count as relevant, and narrowly technical “digitization” (e.g., document scanning) without societal transformation, which may be out of scope.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants a concise paragraph that defines "Digitalisierung" (digitalization) and summarizes its significance, main effects, and typical applications (e.g., in business, public services, and daily life). They likely need a clear, ready-to-use text for an essay, report, or presentation.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "digitalisierung" if it directly addresses digitalization as a process—covering strategies, technologies, policy, case studies, implementation steps, or measurable outcomes (for example, papers on e‑government rollout, Industry 4.0 adoption, cloud migrations, or workforce digital‑skill programs). Relevant texts typically use related terminology (IoT, AI, digital transformation, digitization strategy), give concrete examples or metrics, and explain challenges and solutions. Non‑relevant documents merely mention the word in passing, use it in an unrelated sense (e.g., simple file scanning labeled “digitization”), are generic marketing spam, or focus on tangential topics without substantive discussion. Edge cases include language/term differences (German "Digitalisierung" vs English "digitization"), sector‑specific reports that may be relevant only to particular industries, and older sources whose guidance may be outdated; a brief mention or a translated hit may be useful depending on user intent but often isn’t sufficient. Signals of high relevance are in‑depth coverage, clear methods or case studies, up‑to‑date dates, and matching language/region.</narr>

They need information about available items, languages (German/English), and how these questions were pretested (cognitive interviews/web probing).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "digitalisierung" if it substantively addresses digital technologies, ICT use, digital skills or workplace digitalization — for example pretests and modules on ICT at work, IoT surveys, items about home office and digital tools, or instruments like the ICTSC25 and the technology-commitment/technophobia scales. Concrete examples of relevant documents are the BIBB/BAuA Erwerbstätigenbefragung pretest on digitalization of work, the Community Survey modules on ICT use or IoT, and questionnaires evaluating digital teaching implemented during COVID-19. A document is non-relevant if it only mentions "Digitalisierung" in passing, consists solely of administrative metadata (sampling frames, fieldwork logistics) without substantive digital content, or deals with unrelated topics where digital terms are used as buzzwords. Edge cases include bilingual translation or cognitive-testing reports: these are relevant if the tested items cover digital topics (even if the focus is on wording), whereas psychometric papers about unrelated constructs or historical descriptions that do not engage with digital technologies would be borderline or non-relevant.</narr>

<title>sicherheitsempfinden</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an overview of “Sicherheitsempfinden” (subjective sense of security) in Germany—its definition, measurement, and key drivers such as crime exposure, media, demographics, and vulnerability. They also want evidence on its consequences for quality of life, voting behavior, and attitudes toward policing, public spaces, and policy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly addresses the subjective sense of security (Sicherheitsempfinden)—for example by defining it, measuring it with surveys or indicators, or analyzing its determinants or consequences (such as media coverage, personal victimization, vulnerability, demographics, or effects on voting in the 2017 Bundestag election using datasets like GLES or ALLBUS). Studies that compare subjective perceptions to objective crime statistics, or that examine specific contexts—public spaces, policing and border control, refugee-related crime debates, campus sexual harassment, or urban quality of life—are also relevant, even when limited to subpopulations (e.g., women in Heidelberg or older workers). Analyses of “symbolic” security policy that explicitly discuss managing public feelings of safety qualify as well. Non-relevant documents are those that only treat objective security or crime without linking to perceived safety, or that use “Sicherheit” in unrelated senses (e.g., IT security, purely financial/job security) without discussing subjective feelings. Edge cases include papers that mention Sicherheitsempfinden only in passing without empirical or conceptual treatment, or that use synonyms or variants like subjektives Sicherheitsgefühl/Unsicherheitsempfinden, which should still be considered if the focus is on perceived safety.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks survey datasets and findings on perceived safety (Sicherheitsempfinden), fear of crime, and victimization, including how media consumption relates to crime perceptions, the perceived severity ranking of offenses, and trust in institutions. It also covers attitudes toward security measures versus civil liberties, policy preferences, and detailed demographics and methodologies from German (and some EU/UK comparative) populations.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it measures or analyzes subjective Sicherheitsempfinden (perceived safety), for example feelings of safety in one’s neighborhood after dark, on public transport, or online, and includes related constructs like crime fear, victimization experiences, media use with crime content, or the trade-off between security and freedom. Surveys or datasets that explicitly include items such as “Sicherheitsgefühl nachts in der Wohngegend,” rankings of offences by perceived severity, or CATI/CAWI studies on “innere Sicherheit” with demographic controls are strong matches. Documents are not relevant if they discuss security policy, defense, or institutional arrangements without capturing respondents’ personal feelings of safety, or if “Sicherheitsempfinden” appears only tangentially (e.g., as a buzzword without measurement). Partial or edge cases include studies that focus solely on internet security feelings (relevant if they measure perceived online safety) or broad projects where Sicherheitsempfinden is a small module embedded among many topics—these are relevant but narrower in scope. Pure crime statistics, economic “security” without subjective perception, or evaluations of CCTV/airport measures that omit any reported safety feelings would be non-relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants to describe or assess their personal sense of safety ("Sicherheitsempfinden") in public places—whether they generally feel safe or unsafe. They may also be seeking to identify circumstances or factors (time, location, crowding, lighting, etc.) that influence that feeling.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it focuses on people's subjective sense of safety in public places, for example survey questions or interview responses asking “Do you generally feel safe at public places?” or analyses of how perceptions vary by time of day, lighting, crowding, police presence, gender or age. Useful documents will describe measurement methods (Likert-scale questions, open-ended personal accounts, neighborhood safety indexes) or give concrete examples like “I don’t feel safe in poorly lit parks at night.” Non-relevant documents discuss unrelated kinds of security (cybersecurity, physical locks, workplace health-and-safety rules) or only present raw crime statistics without linking them to perceived safety. Edge cases include materials that use only the word “Sicherheit” (safety) without addressing “empfinden” (feeling) — these may be partially relevant if they discuss public safety conditions — and short or truncated German phrases; texts in German that mirror the question are especially pertinent, while translations and broader mental-health discussions are relevant only when tied to feeling safe in public spaces.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking information on how to measure and analyze citizens’ subjective sense of security in municipalities—covering fear of crime, traffic safety, and perceptions of urban security work. They likely want methodological tools and survey approaches (e.g., EU AUDITS guidelines, cognitive online pretests/web probing) to inform local prevention policies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it discusses citizens’ perceived safety (Sicherheitsempfinden), such as surveys on fear of crime, perceived safety in traffic, or how residents judge municipal security efforts. Methodological content that explains how Sicherheitsempfinden is measured—e.g., cognitive online pretests, web probing, or European guidelines for security analysis—is also relevant because it operationalizes the concept. By contrast, items about objective crime rates, general safety regulations, or IT/cybersecurity “audits” are non-relevant when they do not address subjective feelings of safety. Edge cases include traffic-focused pieces: those analyzing perceived safety in traffic are relevant, while those limited to accident statistics or engineering standards are not; texts using synonyms like Sicherheitsgefühl or fear of crime should be considered relevant. The given paragraph is highly relevant because it centers on a project that surveys residents’ subjective Sicherheitsempfinden and details the pretesting methodology.</narr>

<title>digitalisierung arbeit</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks analyses of how digitalization is transforming work—its conditions, organization, employment, and skill requirements—across sectors. They want sociological and policy perspectives on shaping this change (e.g., co-determination, gender equality, training, and sector-specific cases) rather than purely technological views.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly links digitalization (Digitalisierung) to work/labor (Arbeit), such as effects on working conditions, job design, employment, skills/qualification, co-determination, or gender relations—e.g., analyses of Industry/Arbeit 4.0, logistics or care sectors, office work, platform/crowdwork, or surveys of Betriebsräte. Both empirical studies (case studies, interviews, surveys) and theoretical or policy pieces are relevant when they frame digital transformation in workplace contexts, even if new technology itself plays a minor role (e.g., governance, organizational processes, or negotiation of change). Non-relevant items are those about digitizing archives or cultural heritage, general e-government or education technology without ties to employment or workplace practice, or uses of “Arbeit” in unrelated senses. Edge cases include broad digital-capitalism debates or gender-equality discussions: they are relevant only if they connect to labor outcomes or workplace design; likewise, education/training pieces qualify when they address vocational or job-related upskilling. German synonyms and cues like Arbeitswelt, Arbeitsorganisation, Mitbestimmung, Qualifizierung, Industrie 4.0, mobile Arbeit, or Geschlechterverhältnisse in Betrieben are strong indicators of relevance.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks data-driven insights on how digitalization is transforming work in Germany, including employee attitudes, workplace practices (e.g., home office), required skills, and impacts on employment. They want empirical studies and surveys across sectors (business, public administration, education, and civil society) to understand opportunities, risks, and policy needs in the Work 4.0 context.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it links digitalization to work, employment, or workplace dynamics—e.g., studies on Homeoffice effects, workers’ skills for “Arbeiten 4.0,” impacts on labor demand (job losses/gains), changes in personnel policy and labor relations, or how specific digital tools (PCs, laptops, smartphones) shape workload, time pressure, or work-life balance. Empirical surveys of employees, firms, or sectors about digital transformation at work (such as SOEP LEE2, DiWaBe, or Kantar’s “Zukunft der Arbeit”) are strong matches, as are analyses of atypical employment where digitalization is a driver, or assessments of employers’ digital readiness. Documents mainly about digitalization in education, libraries, higher education teaching, or public e-services are not relevant unless they explicitly connect to working conditions, employment outcomes, or workplace practices (for example, how university digitization affects staff work or how e-government changes public servants’ work). Edge cases include volunteer work (Ehrenamt)—potentially relevant if treated as “work” practices in rural settings—and broad attitude surveys on “digitalization” that count only when they report labor-market or workplace-specific effects; general privacy, EU policy, or open science topics without a work nexus would be non-relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>User wants survey questions, variables and statistics about how digitalization affects work — e.g., job satisfaction, teleworking or working at different locations, time pressure, part-time work, public vs. private sector differences, self‑employment networks and managerial responsibilities. They are trying to find relevant survey items and data to analyze the relationship between digitalization and working conditions.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "digitalisierung arbeit" when it explicitly connects digitalisation (e.g., ICT adoption, automation, platform work, telework, digital workplace tools, or digital skills training) to employment issues such as changing job tasks, work organisation, job satisfaction, or skill requirements. The paragraph you provided mainly lists survey items about job satisfaction, workplace location, responsibility for others, and party performance, without mentioning digital technology, so it would generally be non‑relevant unless specific items or results tie those questions to digital work arrangements. Partial or borderline relevance arises when a text mentions “digital” only in passing (e.g., a single metadata tag) or discusses telework/remote work without framing it as a digital transformation issue—those require closer inspection of methods and findings. Another edge case is documents about digitising public administration: they are relevant only if they analyse effects on jobs, roles, or employee skills; otherwise they are about service delivery rather than "arbeit." To decide fast, prefer documents that contain concrete measures or outcomes linking technology and work (examples, statistics, interventions, or policy impacts); mark as non‑relevant if the content is only generic employment survey variables or political commentary with no digital context.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks information on how digitalization affects work and employment, including the adoption of digital technologies in workplaces and their impacts on jobs, skills, productivity, and working conditions.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to “digitalisierung arbeit” when it examines how digitalization or digital transformation affects work or employment—for example, changes to job tasks, skills, workplace organization, remote work, platforms, automation/AI, or Industry 4.0. It can also be relevant if it addresses policies, training, or organizational change tied to digitizing work processes and the worker experience in digital settings. The provided paragraph instead catalogs psychometric scales (e.g., procrastination, environmental responsibility, job satisfaction, perceived job characteristics) used in ALLBUS and related instruments, with no discussion of digital tools, technologies, or the digitization of work, so it is not relevant. It would only become tangentially relevant if these measures were explicitly analyzed in the context of digital transformation (e.g., how digital tools alter perceived job demands or satisfaction). Edge cases include texts using “digital” in non-technology senses or discussing digitization in unrelated domains (like archiving or environmental norms) without any link to work; these would be non-relevant.</narr>

<title>alkohol</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks research-based information on alcohol consumption, including prevalence and trends, youth drinking behaviors, sociocultural and workplace determinants, and related health and social consequences. Emphasis is on German data and surveys (e.g., ESA) with international comparisons and evaluations of prevention and policy measures.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “alkohol” when it substantively discusses alcohol itself—its consumption, culture, policy, health or social effects, or provides data or analysis about alcohol (e.g., U.S. campus binge drinking, workplace stress linked to alcohol use, or ESA 2021 prevalence and dependence measures). Texts focusing on drinking cultures (bars, toasting rituals), prevention projects, family risk/protective factors, or national policy and mortality (e.g., Russia’s anti-alcohol measures) are also clearly relevant. Compound German terms such as Alkoholkonsum, alkoholische Getränke, Antialkoholkonzept, and topics where alcohol appears alongside other substances remain relevant if alcohol-specific findings or measures are included. A document is non-relevant if “alkohol” appears only in passing (e.g., a brief list item without analysis), solely as a bibliographic tag, or in unrelated acronyms/terms that resemble the keyword (e.g., ALBUS) without any alcohol-focused content. Edge cases include methodological pieces where alcohol is present only as a co-variable; these are relevant only if they report alcohol-related results, not merely mention it among many factors.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking research-based information on alcohol, especially German survey and epidemiological data about prevalence, consumption patterns, misuse, related behaviors (e.g., driving, drug use), health effects, and attitudes among adolescents and adults. This includes insights from national studies like the Epidemiologischer Suchtsurvey (ESA) and related modules on risk factors, prevention, and demographics.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “alkohol” if it substantively covers beverage alcohol use, misuse, dependence, measurement, behaviors, contexts, or consequences (for example, prevalence rates, binge drinking, DUI, therapy, or health effects). The provided paragraph is highly relevant: it details the ESA 2018 survey and related studies, reports 30-day/12-month/lifetime alcohol prevalence, applies diagnostic criteria via the M-CIDI, and enumerates rich alcohol-specific modules (drink types, first intoxication, hospitalizations, self-help, parental drinking, driving under the influence, attitudes, risk perception, and prevention knowledge). Documents remain relevant even when alcohol appears alongside other substances, as long as alcohol receives dedicated measures, analyses, or outcomes. Non-relevant cases include texts that mention “Alkohol” only in passing, use it strictly in chemical/industrial senses (e.g., polyalcohols, solvents, disinfectants), or list it without substantive content. Edge cases include TV program references or broad health surveys where alcohol is only a token item; these are weakly relevant unless they provide concrete alcohol behaviors, harms, or attitudes.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is seeking information about alcohol focused on survey-style measures and public attitudes. Specifically they want data/questions on drinking behavior (age of regular drinking onset, days with 5+ drinks in the past 30 days), perceptions of being detected when driving under the influence, and opinions on tougher penalties and alcohol as a social/political problem.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant for the keyword "alkohol" when it contains substantive discussion of alcohol use, such as survey questions about drinking frequency or age of initiation, descriptions of binge drinking ("5 or more glasses" in the last 30 days), blood‑alcohol scenarios ("08 Promille"/0.8‰) or alcohol‑related offences and policy ("Alkohol am Steuer", higher fines from 2009). The supplied paragraph is highly relevant because it repeatedly names "ALKOHOL AM STEUER", asks about how often people drank, the age they began drinking regularly, and hypothetical detection probabilities for driving with high blood alcohol — all direct matches to search intent. It is less relevant when "alkohol" appears only as a single entry in a long, general topic list or as part of repeated metadata/codes (e.g. V75, cp02) without explanatory text, because those mentions lack substantive content. Edge cases to watch: mentions of "alcohol" in a chemical/industrial sense, negated forms like "alkoholfrei", translations or misspellings, or boilerplate repetitions — these can produce false positives or require downgrading despite containing the keyword.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is likely seeking information on assessment tools for alcohol dependence, specifically a biographical questionnaire that evaluates underlying personality and life-history factors. They want to know which dimensions it measures (emotional insufficiency/neuroticism, adverse primary socialization, and goal striving) and how this biographical inventory differs from standard personality questionnaires by focusing on the patient's life story.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "alkohol" when it substantively addresses alcohol use or alcohol dependence—especially assessment, treatment, epidemiology, or psychosocial instruments designed for people with alcohol problems. For example, the provided paragraph is relevant because it explicitly describes a biographical questionnaire constructed for alcohol-dependent individuals, maps personality dimensions related to alcoholism, and contrasts this inventory with general personality measures. Documents that are not relevant include those that only mention ethanol in a chemical or industrial context, recipes or marketing for alcoholic beverages, or texts where "alkohol" appears only incidentally (e.g., in a bibliography). Edge cases include papers in German (language does not reduce relevance if the topic is alcohol), general personality inventories that become relevant only when applied to alcohol-using samples, and studies focused on biomarkers or comorbid conditions that may be borderline unless they tie findings back to alcohol-specific assessment or outcomes.</narr>

<title>familie</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks scholarly resources on “family” as a social institution, including definitions, models, and comparative analyses across countries and historical periods. They want studies on family structure and change, gender roles, work–family balance, schooling, intergenerational effects (e.g., trauma and secrecy), and family policy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “familie” when it centrally examines family (Familie/Familien) as a social institution, unit, or lived experience—such as empirical or theoretical work on family structures and roles, intergenerational dynamics, policy, or family–work/school relations. Clear examples include studies of secrets in Holocaust survivors’ and Nazi-perpetrator families, analyses of the Japanese family in transition, discussions of Familienpolitik or Familienfreundlichkeit, or research on large families (kinderreiche Familien) and post-socialist family change in Poland or Russia. It is less relevant if “Familie” appears only tangentially (a passing mention, a proper name like “Familie X” without broader analysis), or if the main focus is another institution and family is merely listed in a table of contents. Edge cases include German compounds and inflections (Familienpolitik, Ein-Eltern-Familie, Familiengeheimnisse), which should still count, and methodological pieces (e.g., a Familienscript instrument) that address family via measurement rather than narrative. Documents in other languages or about unrelated “family” metaphors (such as a corporate “brand family”) are generally non-relevant unless they explicitly analyze human families.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks datasets and studies on families—covering household composition, marriage and fertility, parenting and childrearing, gender roles, work–family balance, caregiving, and attitudes—spanning historical records and contemporary surveys (from postwar Germany to the COVID-19 era and some international comparisons). The goal is to analyze family structures, living conditions, and their social and demographic determinants and outcomes across time and regions.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “familie” when family is a central analytic focus—e.g., studies of family living conditions, structure and decision-making, parenting and childcare, marriage and divorce, work–family balance, kinship networks, or demographic measures like household size, family type, and Familienstand. Examples from the paragraph that are clearly relevant include surveys on Lebensverhältnisse von Familien, Vereinbarkeit von Beruf und Familie (including COVID-era changes), attitudes to Ehe und Familie, genealogical family reconstruction (Familien- und Kindertabellen), and ego-centered kin networks (KINMATRIX). Documents are less relevant if “Familie” appears only incidentally, such as TV viewing studies that merely note “watching with the family,” or if “Familie/Familienstand” appears only as a routine demographic control in research about unrelated topics. Edge cases: household-focused statistics without the word “Familie” can still be relevant if they analyze family composition or parent–child relations, while terms like “Familienname” (surname) or passing mentions in policy names don’t qualify unless the content examines family roles or outcomes. Strong signals of relevance include “Familie/Familien-” in titles, headings, or keywords and detailed variables on parenting, childcare, marriage, intergenerational support, or family finances; language, period, or country are secondary to topical focus.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is asking about "family" in the context of a workplace/survey topic — wanting to know who people count as family and how "family" is defined. They also seek views and information on reconciling work and family life (possibilities and employer provisions for balancing career and family).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "familie" when it explicitly discusses family as a topic—for example the repeated survey items in this paragraph like "Was meinen Sie zum Thema Beruf und Familie" or the definitional prompt "WENN WIR HIER SO VON FAMILIE SPRECHEN AN WEN DENKEN SIE DABEI". Relevance is stronger when the term appears in headings, question text, or extended discussion (e.g., family–work reconciliation), not just as a stray token. Non-relevant documents would only contain the string as part of codes or labels (e.g., "V206 VEREINB. FAMILIE" with no substantive content), as a company/name unrelated to household/family topics, or only in irrelevant metadata. Edge cases include inflected or compounded forms (Familie, Familien, Beruf und Familie) and boilerplate or heavily duplicated text: such documents match the keyword but may offer little useful information unless context shows an actual discussion or question about family.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking German social science resources and survey instruments related to family, including Mikrozensus household/family/living-form typologies, methods for constructing bandsatzerweiterungen, and pretested items from FReDA and ISSP on family and gender roles. They also want measures and frameworks such as family support ideologies, domain-specific satisfaction, and the EGP class schema.</desc>
	<narr>For the German keyword “familie,” a document is relevant if it directly examines families, family structures, or related typologies, such as analyses of household-family relationships, “Lebensformen,” or survey modules on family and gender roles. Examples include Mikrozensus reports on bandsatzerweiterungen that enable family-based variables, FReDA or ISSP pretests about partnership, fertility, childrearing, and transnational family support, or instruments measuring justice within the family. Compound terms containing “Familie” (e.g., familienbezogene Leitbilder, Familienformen) and closely linked concepts like Haushalte and Lebensformen are relevant when they describe composition, relationships, or behaviors within families. Edge cases include methodological or coding papers (e.g., SPSS reconstructions) that are relevant because they produce family variables, and general class schemas (EGP) that are only relevant if applied to family or household analyses; scales with a “Family” subdimension are tangential. Non-relevant items would be uses of “Familie” in unrelated senses (taxonomic or product “families”), as a passing mention without analytical focus, or as a proper name.</narr>

They want reviews of measurement frameworks and indices (e.g., Freedom House, Polity IV, V-Dem), typologies and profiles of democracies, and research linking legitimacy, participation, promotion, and backsliding over time.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if democracy is its central subject—defining the concept, comparing models (electoral, liberal, direct), or assessing its quality through indices and audits (e.g., Freedom House, Polity IV, V-Dem, Democracy Barometer, Democracy Ranking). Empirical and theoretical works on types and trajectories of democracies (defective democracies, backsliding, waves of democratization), legitimacy and satisfaction, turnout dynamics, or democracy promotion and justice conflicts are also directly relevant, including country or period case studies like Mexico’s malaise, Germany’s party manifestos, the interwar crisis, or Czech institutional trust. Advocacy or practice-oriented materials that teach how to “speak up for democracy,” or analyses of direct versus representative mechanisms (initiatives, referendums), are relevant because they address democratic processes and norms. By contrast, texts that only mention “democracy” in passing, use it metaphorically or as a brand name, or focus purely on economics or media without linking to democratic institutions, rights, or citizen evaluations are non-relevant. Edge cases include methodological pieces (e.g., cluster analyses of democracy profiles) and historical philosophy surveys; these are relevant when they explicitly tie methods or theory to measuring, classifying, or explaining democracy.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is looking for surveys and datasets on democracy in Germany that measure citizens’ attitudes toward democratic institutions, political participation, media and populism, and changes around reunification, alongside rich demographic variables. They also seek references to specific studies (e.g., Democracy Audit Mannheim, CSES) enabling national and cross-national comparisons of democratic attitudes and electoral behavior.</desc>
	<narr>For the query “democracy,” documents are relevant when their primary focus is on democratic governance, institutions, rights, or citizens’ attitudes and behaviors within democracies. Examples include surveys or studies that measure satisfaction with democracy, the functioning of political systems, core freedoms (press, speech, elections), party competition and opposition, populist attitudes and their electoral implications, or initiatives like the Democracy Audit Mannheim and CSES modules. Highly relevant content also covers Germany’s democratic development and reunification-era views (e.g., democracy vs. socialism), assessments of constitutional performance, and the media’s role in sustaining or undermining democracy, as well as cross-national elite and citizen surveys on democratic norms. Documents are non-relevant if they only name “democracy” in passing, focus solely on unrelated topics (e.g., personal demography or general market-economy issues) without connecting them to democratic principles, or use “Democratic” merely as a party label. Edge cases include mixed-topic questionnaires where democracy is one of many themes (relevant if they contain substantive democracy measures), historical comparisons with dictatorship or authoritarianism (still relevant), and items where “demography” might be mistaken for “democracy” (not relevant unless linked to democratic processes).</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A user searching "democracy" here is looking for how people view the idea of democracy itself—whether they support it and how essential they consider specific features (e.g., free elections, civil rights, gender equality, redistribution, welfare, military intervention, religious law, obedience to rulers). They likely want survey-style measures or questions and public-attitude data about which characteristics define or matter for democracy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "democracy" when it directly discusses the IDEA OF DEMOCRACY or how people understand and evaluate democratic characteristics — for example survey items that ask whether one is for or against democracy or to rate essential features on a 1–10 scale. Concrete indicators of relevance include explicit mentions of free elections, civil rights, equality of incomes, women's rights, taxing the rich/subsidizing the poor, military takeover when governments fail, religious authorities interpreting laws, or state unemployment aid, since these show which attributes are being judged as democratic. Format and context matter: transcripts or questionnaires that repeatedly prompt “in principle are you for or against the idea of democracy” or include question codes (Q39A, pd12, v14) are relevant but may be lower quality if they contain excessive duplication or metadata noise. Borderline or non-relevant cases include texts that only name “democracy” in passing (e.g., as a label, place, or slogan), documents focused solely on specific policy advocacy without tying those policies to the concept of democracy, or files that are mostly corrupted/redundant text and offer no substantive discussion of democratic ideas.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “democracy” when it substantively discusses democratic systems, norms, or outcomes—such as how social media affects participation, polarization, misinformation, or the stability and legitimacy of democratic institutions. Pieces that analyze related constructs (e.g., national pride) in direct connection to democratic integration or defense are also relevant, as are interviews or reviews summarizing research on democracy’s health and challenges. Brief or incidental mentions (e.g., a researcher’s bio or an event description) without tying back to democratic processes would be weakly relevant, and uses of “democracy” as a brand name, in a metaphor, or in mislabelled state titles (e.g., “Democratic People’s Republic of…”) are non-relevant. Edge cases include comparative discussions of authoritarianism if explicitly framed around its impact on democracy, or technology policy pieces that matter only if they connect platform rules to democratic rights, elections, or public discourse.</narr>

<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks research-based insights on alcohol consumption, covering prevalence and trends across demographics, social and environmental determinants, and related outcomes (e.g., delinquency, health, violence), with focus on youth and military contexts and implications for prevention and policy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it analyzes alcohol consumption itself—levels, patterns, trends, or determinants—whether quantitatively (e.g., grams of pure alcohol per day, binge/episodic drinking thresholds) or qualitatively (norms, motives, contexts). Studies linking alcohol consumption to outcomes or settings—such as youth delinquency, violence, health risks, military or student subcultures, national comparisons, or policy effects like taxation and availability—are also relevant. Methodological pieces are relevant when they specifically examine drinking behavior, motives, occasions, or group norms (including religiously motivated abstinence); edge cases include fieldwork reflections where alcohol shapes interviews, which are weakly relevant unless they discuss consumption patterns rather than mere etiquette. Non-relevant documents only mention alcohol in passing, focus on other drugs without a clear alcohol link, or discuss “risk behavior” generically without detailing drinking. Items using synonymous terms (risky drinking, binge drinking/Rauschtrinken), comparing subgroups (men vs. women, age cohorts), or presenting longitudinal survey results are highly relevant, whereas purely theoretical work that never treats alcohol consumption substantively may not be.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks survey-based information on alcohol consumption, including prevalence, frequency, contexts and motives for drinking, preferred beverages, binge episodes, and comparisons to others, as well as how price or policy changes might affect use. They also want attitudes and risk perceptions (especially for youth), knowledge of alcoholism, co-use with tobacco/other drugs, health and social consequences, and demographic patterns in Germany/EU.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “alkoholkonsum” if it discusses alcohol use patterns, attitudes, risks, measurements, or behaviors, especially when it uses the German term “Alkoholkonsum” or close synonyms. Clear signals include surveys or reports detailing drinking frequency, binge/rauschtrinken episodes, preferred beverages (beer, wine, spirits), contexts and occasions for drinking, self-assessment versus peers, youth drinking and legal age, price elasticity, DUI limits/promille, and health or social consequences, as seen throughout the paragraph. Content primarily about tobacco, illegal drugs, medication use, or gambling is only relevant if it contains substantive sections quantifying or evaluating alcohol consumption (e.g., days with 5+ drinks, motives, treatment/therapy), rather than a brief name-drop. Edge cases: materials centered on alcoholism (Alkoholiker) or therapy that reconstruct drinking histories and impacts are typically relevant; mentions of “Alkohol” in unrelated contexts (chemical solvents, mouthwash, or pure advertising policy without consumption metrics) are not. Also treat variants like Trinkverhalten, Alkoholgebrauch, Rauschtrinken, beverage-specific counts, or “last 4 weeks” drinking measures as relevant, while documents offering only interviewer ratings or standalone demographics with no linkage to alcohol use should be considered non-relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for survey question wording and response categories to measure alcohol consumption frequency (e.g., past 12 months and past month), including typical answer ranges like "never", numeric frequency bands (1–5, 6–11, etc.), weekly/monthly/daily categories, and associated skip/branching instructions.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "alkoholkonsum" if it contains questionnaire items or response categories that measure alcohol consumption frequency or recency (e.g., “How often have you drunk alcohol in the last year/month/last 12 months”), including the specific response scales (Never; 1–5 times; approximately once a month; 1–2 times, 3–5 times, …, more than 20 times). Concrete indicators of relevance include survey instructions and skip logic tied to consumption codes (for example “if code 13 continue with 55” or “if yes to monthly code 4 continue with 13b”), labels like FW2/F13/F62, and atypical response options such as “yes but only one gulp.” Partial matches (frequency mentioned without a clear timeframe, or general references to drinking behavior) are somewhat relevant but weaker, while documents that discuss alcohol-related diagnoses, policy, or biomarkers without frequency questions are only tangentially relevant. Non-relevant documents are those focusing on other substances, unrelated health topics, or purely administrative text with no consumption items. Edge cases to watch for include linguistic variations (“consumed,” “had a drink,” German phrasing), duplicate or slightly different scales across forms, and very low-frequency categories that may be coded differently across surveys.</narr>

	<desc>A person searching "alkoholkonsum" is likely seeking concise information about alcohol consumption—its prevalence, health risks and possible benefits, recommended drinking limits, and public‑health guidelines. They may want statistics, trends, or practical advice for safer drinking or reducing alcohol use.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "alkoholkonsum" if it directly addresses patterns, prevalence, health effects, guidelines, policy or prevention related to alcohol drinking—for example public‑health reports, epidemiological studies, WHO or national drinking‑limit recommendations, or clinical guidance on risks and interventions. Useful documents give concrete details such as consumption metrics (standard drinks or grams of alcohol), age and demographic breakdowns, regional laws or trends, and clear outcomes (liver disease, accidents, pregnancy risks); a page summarizing a study on binge drinking rates in Germany would be a strong match. Non‑relevant documents merely mentioning the word in passing, focusing only on alcohol production or cocktail recipes, discussing unrelated chemicals called “alcohols” in chemistry, or being primarily promotional/advertising content are poor matches. Edge cases include language and scope: German‑language or region‑specific materials are often more pertinent for a German query, while older reports or paywalled abstracts may be less useful unless they provide unique historical or methodological insight. Finally, documents that clarify measurement units, thresholds, and context (e.g., pregnancy, youth, cultural norms) are especially valuable; superficial lists or SEO pages that lack data or interpretation should be deprioritized.</narr>

<title>inequality</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks evidence on how actual versus perceived income inequality relate to attitudes—tolerance and support for redistribution—and whether perceptions mediate this link. They want cross-national findings on moderators like social class and fairness/inequality of opportunity, and implications for wellbeing, health, and political engagement.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively analyzes social or economic inequality—its levels, measurement, perceptions, causes, or effects—such as studies of income or wage inequality (e.g., using SWIID, WID, EU-SILC, ISSP), links to redistribution preferences, health inequalities, life satisfaction, or political participation, or country cases like South Africa, the OECD, or the UK. Papers that distinguish actual versus perceived inequality, or fairness concepts like inequality of opportunity versus outcome, and that examine class differences, tolerance, or mobility are also squarely on-topic. Methodological pieces that discuss how to measure inequality (e.g., Gini, pay ratios, intra-household consumption gaps) or critique data and concepts are relevant because they inform what “inequality” means and how it is assessed. Non-relevant items would be those that only mention inequality in passing, use “inequality” purely in a mathematical sense, or focus on adjacent topics (e.g., poverty, education, or redistribution) without connecting them to inequality levels or disparities. Edge cases include documents using synonyms like disparities or fairness without the keyword (still relevant), highly specialized subtypes (gender, educational, intra-household) that are relevant given the broad query, and studies on mobility or opportunity that are relevant if they explicitly tie back to inequality.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks survey-based evidence on inequality—particularly social and gender inequality, fairness, and intergenerational mobility—in Germany and the EU. They want to identify relevant datasets (e.g., ALLBUS, ISSP, Eurobarometer) to analyze public perceptions, attitudes, and trends over time.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “inequality” when it substantively discusses social or economic disparities—such as definitions, measurements, attitudes, causes, or consequences—or provides datasets and survey modules focused on topics like material inequality, relative deprivation, intergenerational mobility, or gender pay gaps. For example, descriptions of ALLBUS modules on Social Inequality, ISSP “Social Inequality” waves, or Eurobarometer modules on “Fairness, inequality and intergenerational mobility,” as well as surveys covering perceptions of conflict and attitudes toward material inequality, are clearly relevant. Content is partially relevant if inequality is one of several modules in a broader instrument but includes dedicated questions, indicators, or downloadable data on inequality; it is non-relevant if “inequality” appears only in passing or as a tag with no substantive treatment. Documents centered on other themes (e.g., nuclear energy, corruption, or health) are non-relevant unless they explicitly analyze unequal outcomes within those domains (such as gender inequalities in the EU or disparities in healthcare safety). Edge cases include boilerplate repeated mentions without added substance, mathematical uses of “inequality” unrelated to social issues, or country-specific studies (Germany, EU) that remain relevant only if they engage inequality as a core analytic topic.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for survey-based information on social and gender inequality, including public attitudes about causes (e.g., benefits to the rich, lack of unions), responsibility, urgency, and preferred remedies. They also want measures of priorities for EU action, perceptions of change over time, and expectations about future inequality.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "inequality" if it discusses inequality substantively — for example by naming types (gender, social-class, income), giving survey question text or variable labels (ISSP items like "Inequality continues to exist because it benefits the rich and powerful" or Q99 "means to reduce sex inequalities"), describing causes (lack of unions, benefits to the rich), policy responses (EU gender policy, priority areas) or trends over time (compared with 10 years ago, future importance). Highly relevant examples include pages that show ISSP question wording and variable codes (ZA1680, ZA3430, V9, V21), lists of urgent gender-inequality issues (being paid less, prejudice, underrepresentation in responsible positions), or explicit proposals for reducing inequality. A document is non-relevant if it only contains unrelated codes or noise (repeated variable IDs with no question text), discusses mathematical inequality symbols rather than social inequality, or only mentions "inequality" peripherally without substantive content. Edge cases include files that contain the right variable codes but omit full question wording (ambiguous for indexing), or documents that focus on one subtype (e.g., racial inequality) — still relevant but should be labeled for the specific subtype and timeframe. For useful retrieval, prefer documents that pair human-readable question text with variable identifiers, context (country, year), and whether the item addresses causes, impacts, or policy solutions.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks scholarly resources on how social inequality is conceptualized and measured, including class stratification (EGP), education coding in surveys, and validated justice-evaluation instruments (JEID, BSJO) with cross-national applications. They also want insights into algorithmic fairness and bias in computational social science and how these affect the assessment of inequality.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly examines social or economic inequality—such as income or earnings distributions, social stratification and mobility, or attitudes toward fairness—using concepts like equity, justice, bias, or established measures (e.g., JEID or BSJO scales) and frameworks like the EGP class scheme. Empirical work that operationalizes, measures, or compares inequality across countries, or that links perceptions of inequality to outcomes, also qualifies (for example, latent profiles of inequality aversion or cross-national validation of justice scales). Content on algorithmic fairness is relevant when it ties bias in socio-technical systems to unequal impacts across groups, even in interview form. By contrast, pieces focused solely on survey methodology, education coding, or occupational taxonomies are only relevant if they explicitly connect those tools to unequal distributions or stratification; purely technical or biographical content is peripheral. Edge cases include education measurement essays that become relevant when framed around educational inequality or returns to education across groups, and class-scheme harmonization papers that matter when used to study comparative inequality rather than just coding conventions.</narr>

<title>social media nutzung</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an overview of research on social media usage—how platforms are adopted and shape communication and behavior. They want evidence and case studies across contexts such as political mobilization and campaigning, informal learning, labor and industry (including Industry 4.0), youth and identity, advertising, and methodological/ethical issues in social media analysis.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “social media nutzung” if it explicitly examines how social media are used—by individuals, groups, or organizations—covering behaviors, purposes, contexts, and platforms (e.g., studies on parties and MPs using Facebook, youths’ practices on SNS, crisis communication in the Arab Spring, corporate use in Industry 4.0, or informal learning via YouTube/Instagram). Empirical evidence such as surveys, usage logs, case studies, or comparative analyses of platform practices (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest) increases relevance. Items are less relevant when social media are only tangentially mentioned or when “Nutzung” refers to something else (e.g., land-use/Flächennutzung projects that merely add a “social media service” without studying SM usage, or theoretical pieces on kybernetics/objectivation that don’t describe user behavior). Methodological or ethical discussions of social media analytics are borderline: they count if they analyze or enable interpretation of usage traces and behavior, but not if they focus solely on methods or privacy without linking to usage patterns. Similarly, advertising-spend reports or image-practice essays are relevant when they detail how advertisers or users engage with channels (e.g., preferring Instagram/YouTube for video), but not when they only list platforms or popularity rankings without describing actual use.</narr>

<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking studies and datasets on social media usage in Germany—who uses which platforms, how often, and for what purposes—across contexts such as academia, politics/elections, digital learning, and the general public. They also want related attitudes and outcomes (privacy concerns, trust, misinformation, scholarly impact) with demographic breakdowns.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it describes or measures how people use social media (Nutzung), such as frequency (e.g., daily use), platforms involved (Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp, Xing, Academia.edu), purposes and contexts (research, teaching, administration, political campaigning, learning), or types of engagement (active vs. passive). Examples include surveys of German researchers’ platform use and work-related practices, social media monitoring of election candidates’ posts and user interactions, or panel studies that report account ownership, device preferences, and usage intensity before/after GDPR. Content focused on attitudes tightly tied to usage—privacy concerns, trust in platforms, reasons for or against using online tools—is also relevant when it includes concrete measures of social media use. Non-relevant are documents about general media consumption without social networks (e.g., TV/radio only), datasets that list accounts or IDs without behavior or engagement metrics, or broad digitalization/democracy studies that lack actual social media usage data. Edge cases like digital learning studies, smartphone activity surveys, or analyses of blogs/podcasts are relevant only if they report social-media-specific behaviors or frequencies (e.g., using WhatsApp/Facebook for learning or documented follower/interaction metrics).</narr>

	<desc>Looking for information on social media usage in Germany — who uses which platforms, how often and for what purposes (communication, news, learning, entertainment), and how use varies by demographics and attitudes (privacy, copyright, civic participation).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "social media nutzung" if it explicitly discusses use of social media platforms, behaviors on networks (frequency, purpose, demographics), platform features or policies, or mentions specific social platforms (e.g., YouTube, Facebook, Instagram) or user-generated content. For example, survey items about "Nutzung von Informationsangeboten im Internet," questions mentioning YouTube, or debates about platform liability for copyrighted material are likely relevant because they touch on how people use online platforms. Documents about social benefits, tax policy, coal mining (Lützerath), or household net income are non-relevant unless they directly link those topics to social media use. Edge cases include generic references to "internet use" or "Nutzung von Informationsangeboten" without naming social networks — these are weakly relevant and require context to decide — and copyright/Internet-platform items, which become relevant only when they explicitly involve social media or user uploads.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking research-based information on social media usage, including how it is measured (e.g., in surveys and via data linkage), patterns and trends of use, and its societal or political implications.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly discusses the use of social media (Nutzung sozialer Medien), such as access, frequency, user behavior, demographics, or platform impacts. Relevant examples here include the interview on social media and democracy and the guideline on linking surveys with Social Media data; items that measure “internetbasierte Dienste” or “Nutzung von Kommunikationsmitteln” can be relevant if they clearly include social platforms. Documents about other kinds of “Nutzung” (e.g., Solariennutzung), general ICT/IoT at the workplace, survey sampling, or topics like justice ideologies, political conservatism scales, smoking cessation, or immigration are non-relevant. Edge cases include pieces on “Geo Social Media” or “Web-Paradaten,” which are only relevant if they use those data to measure or analyze social media usage rather than just describing data infrastructure. Mentions of “Social” in program names (e.g., International Social Survey Programme) or “social justice” scales do not pertain to social media usage and should be excluded.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks scholarly research on patterns, strategies, and determinants of social media use across diverse domains (e.g., newsrooms, museums, relationships, youth health, politics, disaster management, business, migration), including platform-specific differences. They want evidence on how social media use affects outcomes such as trust, participation, agenda setting, life satisfaction, revenue, sexual risk, and social cohesion, and how these effects vary by context, culture, and major events.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it analyzes how people or organizations use social media—what platforms they choose (e.g., Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, TikTok), why they use them, how they engage or strategize, and with what consequences. Examples include studies of museums’ Facebook/Twitter strategies, newsrooms commodifying and distributing content via social media, youth or migrant usage patterns, disaster communication, political participation or disconnection, and using social media to recruit survey respondents. Evidence of usage can be behavioral (posting, sharing, following), strategic (team structures, targeting, agenda setting), or outcome-focused (effects on life satisfaction, trust, sexual risk, revenue, social cohesion). A document is less relevant if it only mentions “media” without addressing social networks, treats social media abstractly without describing use, or merely lists accounts without analyzing behavior; however, critiques of using social media as historical sources or analyses of non-use/disconnection can still be relevant if they examine practices around social media. Edge cases include intermedia agenda-setting papers and lifestyle politics studies, which remain relevant when they assess how social media activity shapes topics or actions, but become marginal if they discuss culture or events without linking them to actual social media use.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks empirical studies and survey data on how people use social media—frequency, platforms/devices, motivations, and attitudes. They want evidence on its impacts on political information behavior, credibility/trust and disinformation, and its use in education and research, including demographic breakdowns.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it describes how people or organizations use social networks, such as reporting frequency or intensity of use (e.g., daily use), platforms used (Facebook/Instagram/Twitter/YouTube/WhatsApp), purposes and contexts (news, politics, learning, research, communication), and concrete behaviors like posting, sharing, commenting, following accounts, or device preferences. Studies that measure attitudes tied to usage (credibility, trust, hate speech exposure), political information behavior on social media (e.g., encountering or seeking political content, following politicians), or institutional/producer-side practices (social media strategy, follower interactions) are also relevant. Documents are non-relevant if they discuss general media or digital tools without isolating social networks, mention social media only in passing without usage metrics or behaviors, or cover historical media use unrelated to social platforms. Edge cases include messaging apps (WhatsApp) and video platforms (YouTube) that function as social networks—these count if the document treats them as social channels with usage data; likewise, broad “Web 2.0” or “online tools” surveys are relevant only when they report specific social media use rather than just listing platforms.</narr>

	<narr>Relevant: this paragraph explicitly contains the question "Do you follow debates on social media..." and media-use variables (qp16a/qp16b) that list "ONLINE SOCIAL MEDIA" and other media types, so it directly matches a query about social media use. It also includes coding labels and response options (e.g., television, internet websites, radio, written press) which are useful if you want the survey wording or item coding for social media-frequency research. Non-relevant: much of the text is duplicated and noisy and many lines concern other topics (questions about how the media cover poverty, cybercrime contacts for hacked accounts) that are adjacent but not central to measuring social media use. Edge cases: treat this document as relevant when you need questionnaire items, variable names or examples of response options, but not relevant if you expect aggregated usage statistics, analytic results, or cleanly formatted data; the repetition and mixed topics mean you’ll need to clean or extract the social-media items before analysis.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it examines how people use social media—such as for news, political communication, or during crises—or if it presents methods to measure or analyze social media use (e.g., web tracking of platform activity, linking surveys to social media data, smartphone sensing of app behavior). Examples here include the interviews on misinformation detection in social media, analysis of visual content from political online platforms, the guide to web tracking for digital media use, the guideline on linking surveys with social media data, and the review on social media and democracy. Methodological or ethics pieces are relevant when they explicitly involve social media platforms or users’ social-media-based communications (e.g., studying vulnerable communities’ online communications on social networks). Non-relevant content includes general psychological or educational scales (ideology, happiness, justice, teacher self-concept), smoking-cessation questionnaires, or broad “media empathy” measures unless they specifically target or validate against social media use. Edge cases: texts that say “online behavior” or “media use” are only relevant if they clearly include social platforms, and fairness/algorithm discussions count only when tied to user behavior or data from social media.</narr>

They also want evidence on transitions from school to training and work, outcomes for disadvantaged youth, and cross-country comparisons.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively discusses vocational education and training in the German-speaking context, using terms like Berufsausbildung, Berufsbildung, duale Ausbildung, Lehre, Erstausbildung, or betriebliche/außerbetriebliche Ausbildung, and addresses structures, reforms, outcomes, or transitions (e.g., effects of automation on curricula, the dual system’s strengths, or employment trajectories after apprenticeship). Empirical studies, policy analyses, and comparative reports—such as longitudinal cohorts of students moving from school to VET, evaluations of integrative or cooperative VET for disadvantaged youth, or cross-country comparisons of VET organization—are clearly relevant. Content focused only on general education or university study without a meaningful link to vocational training, or texts where “Ausbildung” refers to unrelated training (military, medical residency without VET context) are non-relevant. Edge cases include documents centered on higher education but analyzing how completing a Berufsausbildung before or instead of university affects study success or job security (relevant), or pieces that use broader terms like Berufsbildung or talk about Weiterbildung where Berufsausbildung is only mentioned in passing (partially or non-relevant unless VET is a core focus). Historical and regional variants (DDR, Austria’s integrative VET, or IAB/BIBB statistics on apprenticeship markets) remain relevant when they illuminate vocational training systems, policies, or learner outcomes.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking comprehensive information on vocational education and training (Berufsausbildung) in Germany—particularly the dual system—covering goals, coordination, school–industry roles, and stakeholder perspectives (teachers, trainees). They also want data and longitudinal evidence on training outcomes and transitions into work, plus historical context and statistics from the GDR education system.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively describes, evaluates, or measures vocational education and training, such as analyses of the dual system, deficits in company-based training and coordination, or longitudinal tracking of trainees’ transitions from apprenticeship to employment (e.g., the 1989 cohort study with waves on completion, employment status, and contract type). Also relevant are contextual overviews of the DDR system that explain Berufsausbildung mit Abitur, and administrative or survey data that report the share of employees with/without vocational training or capture detailed training trajectories (including in settings like children’s homes with “Berufsausbildung und Arbeitserziehung”). By contrast, items focused on radio listening, political attitudes, or other topics that only list “Berufsausbildung” as a demographic field are non-relevant, as are uses of “Ausbildung” referring to non-vocational contexts (e.g., premilitary training). Edge cases include datasets where vocational training is one of many variables: they are relevant if training pathways or outcomes are analyzed, but only marginally relevant if merely coded as background. Synonyms and variants such as Lehre, duale Ausbildung, apprenticeship with Abitur, or Fort-/Weiterbildung are relevant when explicitly tied to vocational training pathways and outcomes.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>User wants to know whether a person (self or the household's main earner) has a completed vocational training ("abgeschlossene Berufsausbildung") and how that status is asked or recorded on forms (e.g., the question "Haben Sie eine abgeschlossene Berufsausbildung?").</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant when it explicitly records or asks about a completed vocational training — i.e., contains the phrase “abgeschlossene Berufsausbildung” or close variants and survey field labels such as v75, v154, V294, V295, zu02, etc., or headings like “Haben Sie eine abgeschlossene Berufsausbildung”, “EIGENE BERUFSAUSBILDUNG” or “BERUFSAUSBILDUNG DES HAUPTERNÄHRERS.” Examples of highly relevant material are questionnaires, census forms, or database fields that store answers to that exact question or its abbreviations (e.g., “ABGESCHL. BERUFSAUSBILD.”, “ABGESCHL.BERUFSAUSBILDG.”). Documents are not relevant if they only mention general education or other credentials (university degree, continuing education), discuss ongoing or incomplete training (e.g., “Ausbildung abgebrochen” or “in Ausbildung”), are in unrelated languages, or contain the term only as OCR noise or repeated metadata without substantive content. Edge cases include synonymous wording (“Lehre”, “Ausbildung abgeschlossen”), foreign/recognized vocational qualifications, or records that contain the field codes but lack answer content; these should be reviewed individually to decide if they meet the query intent.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "berufsausbildung" if it directly addresses vocational training and initial apprenticeship systems — for example, descriptions of the dual system, curricula, qualification outcomes, apprenticeship numbers, policy measures, or survey findings about participation in Aus- und Weiterbildung. The provided paragraph mentions "Aus- und Weiterbildung" within a broader BIBB/BAuA employment survey, so it would be partially relevant if the report contains substantive results about vocational training, apprenticeship pathways, or training needs identified in the survey. It is non‑relevant if the document only covers survey methodology, pretest procedures, cognitive interview techniques, or focuses solely on occupational health and workload without linking findings to vocational education. Edge cases include texts that discuss continuing education or in‑company training (Weiterbildung) — these can be borderline relevant depending on whether they treat initial vocational qualifications; likewise, mentions of "Ausbildung" in purely historical, legal, or non‑German contexts may be less useful despite keyword overlap.</narr>

They also want pathways and measures to obtain or recognize qualifications—retraining, modular/partial qualifications, external exams, and recognition of foreign credentials—to address skills shortages and improve integration of migrants and other disadvantaged groups.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly discusses vocational qualifications (Berufsabschluss) in contexts such as obtaining one (e.g., apprenticeship, Umschulung, Externenprüfung, modular Teilqualifizierung), lacking one and its labor‑market consequences, or recognizing foreign vocational credentials, including costs, funding, and employer demand. Studies, policy reports, or statistics on shares of youth without a Berufsabschluss, the role of standardization/reglementierte Berufe, or the effectiveness of programs (e.g., BBW rehabilitation leading to an anerkannten Berufsabschluss) are strong matches. Content that uses close terms like berufsqualifizierender Abschluss, anerkannter Ausbildungsberuf, or old spelling Berufsabschluß also counts; comparisons to industry certifications or “zertifizierte Spezialisten” are relevant if they clarify they are not equivalent to a recognized Berufsabschluss. By contrast, pieces that only mention “Abschluss” generically, focus solely on academic degrees without vocational linkage, or use “Abschluss” to mean completion/closing in non-education contexts are non‑relevant. Edge cases include migration/integration articles: they are relevant when they address recognition of foreign Berufsabschlüsse or access to vocational training, but weakly relevant if they discuss integration without touching credentials.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks information on vocational/professional qualifications (Berufsabschluss) in Germany—what they are, how they are obtained and recognized, and how they are measured in educational and labor-market data. They also want to understand how such qualifications influence school-to-work transitions, career progression, and employment outcomes.</desc>
	<narr>Documents are relevant if they discuss a vocational qualification (Berufsabschluss) as an outcome, requirement, or variable—e.g., highest vocational degree, completion of an apprenticeship (betriebliche oder schulische Ausbildung mit Berufsabschluss), passing an Abschlussprüfung or Facharbeiterprüfung, timing of obtaining a Berufsabschluss, or recognition of foreign vocational credentials. Highly relevant examples include survey modules asking for “höchster Berufsabschluss,” “angestrebter Berufsabschluss,” notes or results of vocational final exams, pathways like Berufsvorbereitung leading with or without Berufsabschluss, and policy pieces on recognizing foreign Berufsabschlüsse or regulated professions that require a formal vocational credential. Partially relevant are texts that mention Berufsabschluss only as metadata (e.g., parents’ Berufsabschluss) or focus mainly on school or university degrees unless they explicitly connect to Berufsausbildung; discussions of licensing/closure (Lizenzierung) are relevant if linked to the necessity or equivalence of a Berufsabschluss. Non-relevant are documents centered on political polling, values, or general schooling experiences that lack substantive treatment of vocational credentials, or those using “Abschluss” solely for general school or academic degrees without a vocational context. Edge cases: research on upskilling of unskilled workers to Fachkraft roles is relevant when it references the role of a formal Berufsabschluss (or lack thereof) in advancement, whereas mentions of “Studienabschluss” or generic “Abschluss” are not unless tied to vocational training.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user needs to understand or answer whether they hold a "Berufsabschluss" — i.e., a completed vocational training qualification or an academic degree — typically to complete a form or verify eligibility for a job, benefit, or application.</desc>
	<narr>A document is highly relevant to the keyword "berufsabschluss" if it explicitly asks about or describes a completed vocational qualification or academic degree — for example a job application form, CV, certificate recognition form, or guidance on proving a completed apprenticeship or study program. The repeated question "Haben Sie eine abgeschlossene Berufsausbildung oder ein abgeschlossenes Studium" in the paragraph is a direct match and signals a questionnaire or form field, so such a document would be judged very relevant. Borderline or partial relevance occurs when synonyms or variants are used (Ausbildung, Abschluss, Qualifikation) or when the text discusses having no Berufsabschluss ("ohne Berufsabschluss"); these are still pertinent but may require stemming or semantic matching. Non-relevant documents mention similar words in different senses (e.g., a general "Abschluss" meaning a thesis defense, content about ending a career, or OCR/misspellings like "berufsabsschluss") or only contain the term incidentally without substantive information about vocational credentials.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user wants to understand what “Berufsabschluss” (vocational/professional qualification) means and how it is measured and classified in German Demographic Standards (ADM/ASI/Statistisches Bundesamt), including typical survey question wording and categories.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses “Berufsabschluss” (vocational/professional qualification), such as defining the term, listing categories, collecting it in surveys, or presenting data or policies about completed vocational qualifications. The provided paragraph is relevant because it names “Schul- und Berufsabschluss” as a measured demographic attribute in the Demographische Standards and describes pretesting survey questions that capture it across multiple modes. Related variants like “Berufsabschlüsse,” “beruflicher Abschluss,” “Ausbildungsabschluss,” or “Berufsausbildung abgeschlossen,” including hyphenation variants, also count when they clearly refer to completion of a vocational/professional qualification. Non-relevant items would discuss “Abschluss” in other senses (e.g., Vertragsabschluss, Saisonabschluss) or focus solely on academic degrees without linking them to vocational completion. Edge cases include documents that only mention the term in passing or in metadata (weakly relevant) and English texts using “vocational/professional qualification,” which are relevant if they clearly map to the German concept.</narr>

They want comparative and empirical studies (e.g., Germany, Latin America, West Africa) on mass and social media, regulation, diversity, and public opinion.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses Medien as its main topic—e.g., defining media, analyzing media systems and policies, examining media use (youth, families, education), exploring effects such as agenda setting or democratization, or theorizing media materiality and practices. Examples of strong relevance include country reports on press/radio/TV/online systems, studies of media pluralism or social media in politics, analyses of children’s TV effects and youth media habits, or theoretical pieces on digital media and intermediality. Partially relevant items are those where Medien appear as a significant section within a broader theme (such as general pedagogy or security studies) but are not the dominant focus; these may still match if the media discussion is detailed and central to the argument. Non-relevant hits include mere name drops (e.g., “Internationales Handbuch Medien” cited without discussion), organizational addresses, uses of Medien meaning “spiritual mediums” or laboratory media, or unrelated near-terms like Medizin. Because the query is broad and in German, documents using compound or specific forms—Massenmedien, soziale/digitale Medien, Medienpraktiken, Medienbildung—are also relevant when the core discussion is about media.</narr>

<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks studies and datasets about media usage and influence, including how people use and trust different media for product decisions and political information, and the media’s role in democracy and election coverage. It also looks for evidence on the adoption of digital media and learning technologies across schools, universities, vocational training, and adult education, along with device access, usage patterns, and demographic profiles.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it centers on mass media in the German sense of “Medien,” such as media use and reach, device ownership, consumption habits, credibility and trust, the role of media in politics and democracy, social media, or digital learning with media. Examples include surveys listing TV/radio/newspaper usage, SmartTV/smartphone availability, assessments of media objectivity, media–politics interactions (journalists vs. politicians), analyses of election coverage, and studies of Medienkompetenz or Soziale Medien. Materials on education that focus on digital media, learning platforms (e.g., Moodle), E-Assessment, or media literacy also qualify, especially when using German compound terms like Mediennutzung, Medienvertrauen, or Medienpädagogik. Non-relevant items include “Medien” used in other senses (biological culture media, artistic mediums, storage media, CSS media queries), the historical region “Media,” or documents where the word appears only incidentally without substantive discussion. Edge cases: organization or project names containing “Medien” are relevant only if the content substantively addresses media topics; broad political or lifestyle surveys count only when media coverage, influence, or consumption is a primary focus rather than background detail.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for public-opinion survey items and measures about the media — e.g., how often people use TV/press/radio/internet and social media for political information, perceptions of media bias and influence (including coverage of politicians and scandals), and attitudes toward media reporting on topics like right‑wing extremism, gender‑inclusive language, DDR coverage, and whether people contacted authorities or the media about grievances. They need concise examples of questions assessing media use, trust, perceived fairness, and topic interest.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant for the keyword "medien" when it directly discusses media as an institution or information source — for example when it reports on media coverage of politicians (Christian Wulff, Michel Friedman, Peer Steinbrück, Gerhard Schröder), asks how often people use television/newspapers/radio/the Internet for political information, or surveys opinions about media influence, right‑wing extremism in the media, or gender‑neutral language in the media. The provided paragraph is highly relevant because it repeatedly names "Medien" in questions about coverage, frequency of use, influence on political opinion, and social media as an information source, and even contains concrete survey items (e.g. ZA5573 2008) and topical examples. Non‑relevant documents would only contain "Medien" as a field label or code (V270, V311) with no substantive text, use "medien" as a substring in unrelated words, or discuss other kinds of media (e.g. biological culture media, multimedia file formats) that are not about news/communication. Edge cases include survey forms that mention "soziale Medien" but focus on other topics (relevant but lower priority), duplicate boilerplate lines (add little new information), and multilingual corpora where "medien" appears incidentally — these should be checked for actual topical content before scoring them as fully relevant.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks information on how “media” is measured and examined across the cited projects—survey modules on social media (GLES 2021), items capturing access, usage, and network size for communication media, and the “media” dimension in the ERBSE‑L teacher self-concept instrument. They also want evidence on how media reporting and sampling methodology affect trust in survey results.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “medien” if it substantively addresses media as channels or platforms—e.g., social media, communications media, or media use/access—such as modules on soziale Medien in the GLES 2021 pretest or questions capturing access and usage of Festnetz, Mobiltelefon, and internetbasierte Dienste. It is also relevant when “Medien” is a defined analytical construct (for example, a self-concept dimension within ERBSE L) and the document meaningfully measures or discusses that media-related dimension. By contrast, texts that only mention media in passing (e.g., noting that survey results appear “in den Medien”) or use “Medien” as part of a name or aside without analyzing media behavior, access, or effects are non-relevant. Edge cases include documents centered on politics or education that are still relevant if they analyze media use or social media modules, and communications channels (landline/mobile/internet) counting as Medien; however, unrelated homographs like “Median” or generic “medium/mediocre” usages are not. Pretests or cognitive interview reports remain relevant if their items or stimuli focus on media access, use, or networks, even when detailed item-level results are not documented.</narr>

<title>beschäftigungsverhältnis</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is looking for information on the concept and legal meaning of an employment relationship (Beschäftigungsverhältnis) in Germany, including its forms (e.g., regular, fixed-term, temporary agency, mini-jobs) and social insurance implications. They may also seek evidence on how labor policies and programs affect entry into, retention of, and transitions between these employment types.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively discusses the establishment, type, conversion, maintenance, or termination of a Beschäftigungsverhältnis (employment relationship), including legal, statistical, or policy angles, and uses that term or close synonyms such as Arbeitsverhältnis. Examples include studies on fixed-term versus permanent contracts, attempts to bundle temp agency assignments into longer employment relationships, conversions of Minijobs into sozialversicherungspflichtige Beschäftigungsverhältnisse, or models like AuB where a dual/continued employment relationship is preserved. Also relevant are evaluations of measures that directly affect employment relationships (e.g., Eingliederungszuschüsse reducing separation risks, Kurzarbeit preserving contracts, or transitions from unemployment into a regular Beschäftigungsverhältnis) where the term is explicitly addressed. Non-relevant are pieces that only discuss broad labor market trends, underemployment, or self-employment without linking to the existence, quality, or change of an employment relationship, or where the term appears merely in passing. Edge cases to include are plural/inflected forms, hyphenation variants, and near-synonyms, as well as discussions of barriers for disabled graduates entering sozialversicherungspflichtige Beschäftigung or academia’s scarcity of fixed employment; exclude materials focused solely on training or funding unless they tie back to entering, keeping, or ending a Beschäftigungsverhältnis.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking German datasets and statistics on employment relationships—employment status/type, contract terms, duration, wages, and employer characteristics. They are interested in sources like social insurance–based employment records and higher-education personnel data (HISTAT/DFG), including analyses of atypical and recall employment.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to “beschäftigungsverhältnis” if it defines, measures, or analyzes an employment relationship, such as contract type (temporary/permanent), employment type (full-/part-time), start/end and duration of a job, or employer characteristics. Clear examples include social-insurance employment statistics listing variables like employment type, reason for insurance change, gross daily wage, begin/end of employment, as well as higher-education staff series that tabulate academic personnel by employment relationship and funding, and studies of “recalls” or atypical work. Also relevant are datasets on social-security-exempt jobs and side jobs, or panels that explicitly ask about contract status (befristet/unbefristet), public service, Stellung im Beruf, or Beschäftigungsumfang; synonyms such as Beschäftigungsstatus or Vertragsart count. Non-relevant are materials where employment relationship is absent or merely incidental (e.g., an addiction study that only notes a respondent’s job as demographics, or education statistics focused solely on students). Edge cases include documents that mention the term only as a column label in long variable lists, or policy databases where Beschäftigungsverhältnis appears for a narrow subgroup (e.g., childcare staff), which are only marginally relevant depending on the search intent.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for wording to determine a person's current employment relationship—specifically the type of contract and whether it is fixed‑term—and to ask if they searched for paid work in the past four weeks (including those currently in permanent jobs). This is likely for survey or questionnaire items about employment status and recent job‑search activity.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses the German survey phrasing and concepts in the query — for example it contains the questions "In welchem Beschäftigungsverhältnis stehen Sie?", "Ist Ihr Beschäftigungsverhältnis befristet?", or wording about "Suche nach bezahlter Tätigkeit in den letzten 4 Wochen", or if it includes the variable codes (v05001, w06001, etc.) with definitions. Highly relevant examples are questionnaire forms, survey codebooks, data dictionaries or methodology notes from labor force surveys that list those exact items and response categories (e.g., fixed-term vs. permanent, searching for paid work). Non-relevant documents include general articles on employment law or job market trends that do not specify contract type or recent job-search behavior, job postings, or texts about unpaid/volunteer work that use different timeframes or criteria. Edge cases include documents that mention "befristet" or "Beschäftigungsverhältnis" in a different legal/sectoral context, items that refer to job-seeking without clarifying "paid" or the "last 4 weeks", or datasets that list variable codes without accompanying question text — these may be partially relevant if you can map codes to questions but are weaker than full question-and-response documentation.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is likely asking for the meaning and operational use of the German term "Beschäftigungsverhältnis" — i.e., a person’s employment relationship or employment status (employee vs. self‑employed, employer, unpaid family worker; contract type such as full/part‑time, permanent vs. temporary, formal vs. informal). They may also want to know how that variable is recorded in surveys and classifications (for example ESeC uses it together with ISCO08 job codes and occupational position to assign socio‑economic class, and caregiving surveys use it to identify whether and how care workers are employed and paid).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "beschäftigungsverhältnis" if it explicitly discusses the type or status of employment relationships — for example distinctions between formal vs informal work, full‑time/part‑time, self‑employment vs employee status, or the variable "Art des Beschäftigungsverhältnisses" used in coding. Items that describe how employment-status information is collected or harmonized (e.g. ESeC/ISCO08 recoding rules, SPSS syntax, or survey questions about employment and payment of care workers) are directly useful. A document is not relevant if it only mentions employment in passing or focuses solely on a different topic (e.g. survey methodology like the Person Count Technique) without providing definitions, categories, or operationalization of employment relationships. Edge cases include texts that use synonymous terms ("Arbeitsverhältnis", "employment status", "Beschäftigung") — these are relevant if they contain the same operational detail — and materials in another language that quote the German variable name, which can be relevant for cross‑national coding.</narr>

<title>berufsprestige</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an overview of occupational prestige: what it is and how it is measured and compared internationally using ISCO-based scales and Wegener’s Magnitude Prestige Scale, including coding and validity issues. They also want findings on its determinants (e.g., education and parental status) and its use in research on social mobility, socioeconomic status, and career outcomes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it defines or measures Berufsprestige (occupational prestige), presents or validates prestige scales (e.g., Wegener’s Magnitude Prestigeskala, ISCO-based standards), or uses occupational prestige as a key variable in analyses of social mobility, education, class, or SES. Studies that report prestige scores for occupations, discuss coding and comparability issues (e.g., ISCO vs KldB mappings), or examine cross-national invariance and scale reliability/validity are highly relevant. Partially relevant are works that treat Berufsprestige as a secondary control or one component of a broader index (e.g., “career success” combining income, prestige, and position) or that focus on the prestige of a single occupation (e.g., physicians) without broader theorizing. Non-relevant are pieces that only discuss occupations or labor markets without prestige, use “prestige” in a non-occupational sense, or mention the term in passing without data, scale information, or analytic use. Edge cases include self-assessed versus societal prestige, parent’s occupation prestige as a background variable, or methodological papers on converting datasets to prestige scales—these are relevant if they address measurement or application of Berufsprestige explicitly.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>Find datasets and coding resources for occupational prestige (Berufsprestige), especially ISCO-based mapping files to prestige/status scales such as Treiman SIOPS, Wegener MPS, ISEI, and related SES measures. Identify German and European surveys (e.g., ALLBUS, ZUMA, Eurobarometer) that include these variables to enable matching prestige scores to other ISCO-coded data.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly measures or operationalizes occupational prestige (Berufsprestige), for example by providing or applying scales such as Treiman’s SIOPS, Wegener’s Magnitude Prestige Scale (MPS), ISEI (Ganzeboom), or German variants like TBP/MBP, or by mapping ISCO-68/88 occupation codes to these prestige/status indices. Materials that include survey items asking respondents to rate the prestige of selected occupations (e.g., ZUMABUS or Eurobarometer modules) or that analyze the prestige of specific professions (e.g., doctors, stewardesses, shoemakers) also clearly qualify. Documents are typically still relevant even when Berufsprestige appears as a derived variable within broader datasets (e.g., ALLBUS files listing “Berufsprestige nach Treiman/Wegener” for each ISCO code) or when prestige scales are provided to be matched onto other data. By contrast, texts that discuss prestige in non-occupational contexts (e.g., neighborhood prestige, brand prestige) or that only treat general socio-economic status without any occupation-based prestige scale are non-relevant. Edge cases include files that mention only abbreviations (SIOPS, MPS) without the German term, or datasets that require ISCO coding to attach prestige scores—both are still relevant, whereas measures like “social distance to occupations” without a prestige metric are borderline unless explicitly tied to occupational prestige.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants a concise definition and explanation of "Berufsprestige" (occupational prestige), including how professions are ranked and which factors (income, education, social respect, measurement methods like surveys or prestige scales) determine those rankings. They may also be looking for example rankings or the term's relevance in sociology and labor research.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "berufsprestige" if it contains a paragraph that defines or discusses occupational prestige, explains how it is measured (for example SIOPS, Treiman’s scale, or survey-based rankings), or gives concrete examples or lists of professions ranked by social status. Relevant documents will also analyze causes and consequences of berufsprestige—such as education, income, or cultural values—or present empirical results from surveys or cross‑country comparisons. Non‑relevant documents merely mentioning the word in passing, using "prestige" in a non‑occupational sense (brand prestige, product names), or containing only metadata, isolated tables, or code without explanatory text should be excluded. Edge cases include multilingual works where "berufsprestige" appears only in a bibliography or a translated term in an otherwise English discussion (potentially useful), and historical or marketing uses that resemble the concept but do not address its sociological meaning (likely not useful). In a German query context, German‑language paragraphs are preferable, but rigorous English analyses explicitly about occupational prestige are also relevant.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks information on occupational prestige in Germany, focusing on Wegener’s Magnitude Prestige Scale (MPS), its dependence on ISCO-68 coding, and the challenges of applying it to official data coded with the German KldB. They also want methods or references for reconstructing or mapping the MPS to KldB (e.g., Frietsch & Wirth 2001).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses occupational prestige (Berufsprestige) in Germany, especially by discussing the Magnitude Prestigeskala (MPS) developed by Bernd Wegener, its reliance on ISCO‑68 coding, or efforts to map/reconstruct it for German classifications like the KldB (e.g., for the Mikrozensus). Content that details the methodological challenges of converting KldB to ISCO‑68, reports on reconstruction approaches (such as Frietsch & Wirth 2001), or uses MPS scores as an indicator of social status would also be clearly relevant. By contrast, pieces that only describe job classifications without any prestige measure, discuss “prestige” in a non-occupational or non-German context, or cover other prestige scales without linkage to MPS in Germany are not relevant. Edge cases include papers on international prestige scales (e.g., Treiman/SIOPS) or ISCO crosswalks that could be relevant if they tie back to German occupational prestige or MPS application, and studies on “soziale Lage” that matter only if occupational prestige is operationalized via MPS or a compatible measure.</narr>

<title>arbeitgeber</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an overview of employers (Arbeitgeber) in Germany and their role in the labor market. They want information on legal and policy obligations and interactions, including training/apprenticeship levies, social insurance contributions, and relations with unions and public agencies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “arbeitgeber” if it primarily discusses employers in a German context—such as their legal obligations, costs, strategies, or relationships—using the term “Arbeitgeber” as a central concept. Examples include analyses of an Ausbildungsabgabe for firms that do not train apprentices, studies of the Bundesagentur für Arbeit’s employer services, research on employer associations and collective bargaining, comparisons of public vs. private employers, or discussions of employer social insurance contributions and wage-setting practices. Content centered mainly on employees or unions is only relevant if it explicitly examines employers’ decisions or roles (e.g., how employers’ hiring behavior affects long-term unemployment); mere passing mentions of “Arbeitgeber,” appearances in author affiliations, or generic labor-market overviews without employer-focused analysis are non-relevant. Edge cases that should count as relevant include sector-specific employers (e.g., church welfare organizations), international comparisons where “employers” are substantively analyzed even if the term appears in translation, and legal summaries where “Arbeitgeber” is a defined party with duties or exemptions. Conversely, documents focused solely on jobseeker services, macroeconomic trends, or worker rights without detailing employer actions, incentives, or regulations should be considered non-relevant.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks German datasets and surveys focused on employers—their roles, attitudes, responsibilities, and public perception. Key areas include workplace functional illiteracy, evaluations of employers (e.g., the Bundeswehr), employer responsibilities in social insurance and training, and employer-related working conditions and atypical employment.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “arbeitgeber” when it treats employers as central actors, policies, or contexts—e.g., surveys of employers about hiring unskilled workers and support for functionally illiterate staff, analyses of employer-provided training or obligations to be informed by employees, or perceptions of an organization as an attractive employer (such as repeated modules on the Bundeswehr as an employer). Data where employers finance or deliver benefits, like social budget tables distinguishing employer contributions or “Arbeitgeberleistungen,” and business/establishment censuses that count employees at employers’ worksites in NRW, also qualify as relevant. Studies of atypical employment that assess expectations of employers, equal treatment by employers, or employer behavior toward flexible work arrangements are likewise in scope. Non-relevant are items where “Arbeitgeber” appears only incidentally (e.g., a single demographic field like “duration with current employer,” generic personal data verification, or pension details that only mention an employer once without analysis), or documents focused solely on employee traits with no employer perspective. Edge cases include multi-topic surveys where employer content is a minor submodule (marginally relevant) and texts that mention employers only as one of many possible cost-bearers without substantive discussion of employer roles.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A summary of employer–employee relations and policies, particularly employer countermeasures to strikes (lockouts) and public opinion on whether employers should be allowed to lock out workers. Also seeks routine employment details and contract information—start date, written vs. oral agreement, control over working hours, supervisory responsibility, and employer contributions to social/care insurance.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "arbeitgeber" when it explicitly discusses employers or employer-related actions, roles, policies, or survey questions — for example mentions of "Arbeitgeber", "Arbeitgeberbeitrag", lockouts ("Aussperrung"), employer-determined working hours, start dates with the current employer, or whether an employer pays part of insurance costs. Passages that pose questions about being employed by or responsible for others, that describe employer–union agreements, or that record employer contributions are good evidence of relevance. Conversely, a document is non-relevant if the word appears only in passing (e.g., as a fragmentary code label like V120), in boilerplate lists without substantive context, or as an unrelated name in a directory. Edge cases include compound terms and synonyms ("Firma", "Dienstherr", "Arbeitgeberbeitrag"), different word forms or languages (German vs English), and texts about employers in peripheral contexts (taxation, historical mentions) where the match may be superficial; examining nearby verbs, policy terms, or question formats helps disambiguate intent.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “arbeitgeber” (employer) if it explicitly mentions an employer or discusses employer-related details, such as questions about one’s employer, employment start date, employer policies, or employer characteristics (e.g., “Fragen … dem Arbeitgeber und dem Beschäftigungsbeginn” in a survey description). Documents using clear variants and compounds like “Arbeitgeberverband,” “Arbeitgeberanteil,” or regional synonyms such as “Dienstgeber” can also be relevant, as can English equivalents (“employer”) when the context is German employment. Content that focuses on employment or labor markets without referencing an employer (e.g., general skills assessments, methodology, or worker-only issues) is non-relevant. Edge cases include passing mentions where “Arbeitgeber” appears only once in a list (still marginally relevant), ambiguous abbreviations like “AG” (which can mean employer or Aktiengesellschaft), or related terms like “Firma/Betrieb” that imply an employer but don’t state it explicitly; these may be relevant depending on context.</narr>

<title>arbeit zufriedenheit</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user wants studies and survey results on “work satisfaction,” encompassing both job/working-condition satisfaction among various groups and public satisfaction with the work of the German federal government and political developments over time. They seek comparative findings across policy areas and regions (including the former GDR) and insights into key determinants of satisfaction.</desc>
	<narr>For the query “arbeit zufriedenheit,” documents are relevant when they address job or work satisfaction in the sense of employees’ or trainees’ attitudes toward their work, often using terms like Arbeitszufriedenheit, Berufszufriedenheit, or Zufriedenheit mit den Arbeitsbedingungen, including facets such as pay, job security, supervision, colleague relations, workload, and work-life balance. Examples include surveys of young workers’ satisfaction with working and living conditions, studies of early-career academics’ satisfaction with employment conditions and supervision, analyses of apprentices’ satisfaction with vocational training, or research on police presenteeism that measures satisfaction with colleagues as a work-related factor. Documents are non-relevant when “Arbeit” refers to the work or performance of institutions (e.g., the work of the federal government) or when the focus is political or general life satisfaction (democracy satisfaction, satisfaction with policy developments) without a direct link to people’s satisfaction with their own jobs. Edge cases: pieces that discuss labor market policy or political outlooks are not relevant unless they explicitly measure workers’ job satisfaction; conversely, studies where work-life balance or supervisor evaluation is examined as a determinant of job satisfaction are relevant. Language, time period, or region (e.g., DDR-era youth vs. contemporary workers) does not affect relevance if the core construct is satisfaction with one’s work or working conditions.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is looking for studies or datasets on job satisfaction and working conditions—especially among youth—including standardized satisfaction scales, shift work, workplace demands, and links to housing, leisure, and migration intentions. The context spans East German cities and sectors and includes related social and political attitudes captured in national year-in-review surveys.</desc>
	<narr>Relevant documents for the query “arbeit zufriedenheit” are those that directly measure or discuss job satisfaction (Arbeitszufriedenheit), such as “Zufriedenheit mit Arbeitsbedingungen insgesamt und konkret (Skala),” “Arbeitszufriedenheit und Beschreibung der Arbeitsplatzanforderungen,” or items on satisfaction with pay, recognition, workload, autonomy, and workplace relations. Surveys that examine how specific work features affect satisfaction—e.g., shift work (Schichtsystem), work organization, performance evaluation, or collective climate—and that include explicit satisfaction scales or ratings also match. Mixed studies on living and working conditions are relevant if they contain sections like “Zufriedenheit mit der Arbeit/Arbeitsbedingungen,” “Berufszufriedenheit,” or “Zufriedenheit mit der Bezahlung.” Non-relevant are items where “Arbeit” refers to the government’s “work” (e.g., “Zufriedenheit mit der Arbeit der Bundesregierung”) or where satisfaction concerns housing, environment, or politics without any job-satisfaction component. Edge cases include records mentioning “Arbeitsmarktpolitik” or “Arbeit im Schichtsystem” without a satisfaction measure (only relevant if they link to satisfaction outcomes) and broad lifestyle surveys that become relevant only if a job-satisfaction scale is present.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is seeking survey measures and questions related to work satisfaction, including willingness to work even when not searching for a job, frequency of working under time pressure, and collaboration among self‑employed. They also want items about perceived government competence (federal or state, party-led governments) in solving economic and public‑policy problems to the respondent’s satisfaction.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "arbeit zufriedenheit" if it directly addresses individual job satisfaction or work conditions — for example survey items about working under time pressure, willingness to work even when not seeking a job, collaboration in a self-employed network, or explicit phrases like "Arbeitszufriedenheit" or "Wie oft arbeiten Sie ... unter Zeitdruck." The paragraph contains several clearly relevant lines (e.g., "Wie oft arbeiten Sie bei der Erledigung Ihrer Arbeit unter Zeitdruck" and "Auch wenn Sie keine Arbeit suchen würden Sie dennoch gerne arbeiten"), and its German wording matches the query language, which increases relevance. It is non-relevant when the text focuses on political or fiscal topics (e.g., which government can fix the federal budget, party labels like CDU/SPD, economy or terrorism questions) that do not concern personal work satisfaction. Edge cases include texts that mention "Arbeit" in a political sense ("Arbeit der Regierung") or "Zufriedenheit" with government performance — these are false positives unless they also include individual-level job satisfaction items; mixed documents that contain both political and work-satisfaction questions can be partially relevant, with relevance proportional to the amount and prominence of the job-related items.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks information on job satisfaction, specifically German-language survey instruments that measure general work satisfaction and its facets (e.g., self-actualization, resignation, pay satisfaction, company evaluation) and related constructs like workload and organizational climate, including their structure and psychometric properties.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “arbeit zufriedenheit” when it directly addresses job/work satisfaction, for example by presenting a scale or findings about general work satisfaction or dimensions such as self-actualization, resignation, satisfaction with pay, evaluation of the company, workplace climate, or perceived job characteristics like task variety, decision latitude, and psychological job demands. Content that explicitly measures “Zufriedenheit von Arbeit und Beruf” or “Allgemeine Arbeitszufriedenheit,” or links stress models to satisfaction at work, is clearly on-target. It may be only partly relevant if it treats broader satisfaction constructs (e.g., the Satisfaction with Life Scale) or domain satisfaction but explicitly ties them to the work domain; terms like “Zufriedenheit” alone are insufficient without a work context, though synonyms such as Jobzufriedenheit or Berufszufriedenheit count. Documents focused on unrelated satisfaction or traits—residential satisfaction, doctor-visit satisfaction, environmental norms, sensation seeking, health anxiety, or social desirability—are non-relevant unless they are analyzed as predictors or covariates of work satisfaction. Edge cases include measures of “Arbeitsorientierung” or “Betriebsklima,” which can be relevant if connected to or operationalized as components or determinants of work satisfaction.</narr>

<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking information on working conditions, including how they are measured and compared across countries and sectors, key disparities and determinants, and policies or strategies to improve job quality. They may also want sector-specific insights (e.g., healthcare, academia, journalism, manufacturing) and the impacts of digitalization, employment forms, and social policy on workers’ well-being.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly analyzes, measures, or compares Arbeitsbedingungen—such as building indicators from the European Working Conditions Survey, examining working time (duration, timing, flexibility), pay, workload, autonomy, or safety, and linking these to satisfaction, health, or inequality. Sector- or institution-specific studies qualify when they describe how conditions are structured or changing (e.g., Green Jobs, hospitals under DRGs, church employment via the Dritter Weg, cleaning work, journalism, academia, or industrial settings), including differences by gender, contract type, or country. Policy and governance pieces are relevant when they show how collective bargaining, social policy, digitization, or union campaigns shape or improve working conditions, or when they compare “quality of work” across nations using composite indicators. Documents are non-relevant if they only mention the term in passing, focus solely on income, employment levels, or abstract legal/organizational issues without concrete implications for conditions, or discuss family policy without linking it to workplace arrangements. Edge cases include texts using near-synonyms (quality of work, humanization of labor, work organization) that remain relevant if they detail impacts on workers, and working-time studies that are borderline unless they connect scheduling, abnormality, or flexibility to broader conditions.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks survey-based information on working conditions and workplace burdens—such as working hours, shift/overtime patterns, autonomy and control, performance demands, health and safety risks, job satisfaction, discrimination, and employer supports. It aims to compare these factors across industries, occupations, firm sizes, and contexts (e.g., COVID-19, platform work, academia, migrant workers) and by demographic characteristics.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly examines Arbeitsbedingungen (working conditions) at the job, such as weekly hours, shift/night/Sunday work, overtime and pay supplements, workload and stress, autonomy and control over pace/methods, job security, exposure to hazards, discrimination or violence, training and evaluations, or overall job satisfaction. Studies focusing on specific groups or sectors—e.g., essential workers during COVID-19, academic staff (APIKS), platform workers, foreign workers in manufacturing, metalworking under technological change, or professional drivers—are clearly relevant when they report concrete measures of workplace demands and environments. Broad social surveys or business studies are only partially relevant if they contain a distinct section or scale on working conditions; for instance, research on technological change qualifies when it describes how tasks and conditions (e.g., monotony, complexity, speed set by machines/supervisors) change, but not if it only covers employment counts. Non-relevant content centers on housing, leisure, political attitudes, or firm development without specific workplace metrics, or purely demographic/interview logistics variables. Edge cases like commuting time and employer leave policies can count when framed as part of the overall work situation, and COVID-era studies are relevant only when they detail actual changes in work practices and conditions rather than general economic impact.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The query seeks survey items about working conditions in a person’s main job, asking how often various adverse conditions occur and to what extent the job is characterized by them. Key factors queried include heavy physical work, workplace stress, shift work, poor work climate, noise/poor air, long working hours, and time/performance pressure.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "arbeitsbedingungen" when it explicitly addresses working conditions or lists exposures such as Schichtarbeit (shift work), schwere körperliche Arbeit (heavy physical work), Lärm, schlechte Luft, lange Arbeitszeit, Leistungsdruck, or workplace stress — for example, survey items beginning "Wie oft..." or stems like "Ist Ihre jetzige berufliche Tätigkeit..." are direct indicators of relevance. It is non‑relevant when the content only contains unrelated administrative codes, formatting artifacts, repeated boilerplate with no substantive information, or primarily concerns pay, hiring, or job titles without any reference to working conditions. Edge cases include documents made up of variable names and abbreviations (e.g. "Arbeitsbed.", "V294", "hw05"): these often signal a questionnaire or codebook and can be relevant for measurement purposes, but may be borderline if they contain no question wording or explanatory context. Prioritize texts that provide full question wording, frequency scales, or descriptive discussion of exposures; treat isolated metadata or duplicate lines as lower priority unless you specifically need the instrument or coding details.</narr>

They want details on instrument reliability/validity and pretesting methods.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly describes, measures, or evaluates workplace conditions (Arbeitsbedingungen), including physical, organizational, and psychosocial aspects. Examples include survey modules on ICT at the workplace, questions about conditions in one’s last job, instruments like Psychosocial Safety Climate that assess management’s commitment to employees’ mental health, or job satisfaction scales with a specific “Meine Arbeitsbedingungen” subscale. Methodology or pretest reports can still be relevant when they contain items or insights about working conditions, even if framed around validation or focused on specific groups (e.g., ages 55–70). Non-relevant documents focus only on general ICT use in households, retirement and lifestyle without a link to work, or purely report psychometric reliabilities without substantive content about conditions at work. Edge cases include content on Arbeitszufriedenheit or digital skills learning that is relevant only when clearly tied to the work environment, and discussions of colleagues/supervisors or organizational climate that count when they frame the conditions under which work is performed.</narr>

<title>arbeitsbelastung</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The query seeks research on Arbeitsbelastung (work-related load/stress), including how physical and psychosocial demands are measured and how prevalent they are across occupations. It also aims to understand their health and performance impacts (e.g., burnout, sickness absence/presenteeism) and what organizational or occupational-safety interventions can mitigate them.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “arbeitsbelastung” when it analyzes or describes job-related demands or strains on workers—physical or psychosocial—including their measurement (e.g., validated scales or factor-analytic questionnaires), determinants (shift work, reorganization, staffing levels), prevalence across occupations, and consequences such as burnout, presenteeism, absenteeism, or health outcomes. Empirical studies that quantify workload indices (e.g., ABphy/ABpsy), evaluate interventions or organizational changes (e.g., nursing reorganization reducing task load but increasing emotional exhaustion), or link flexible work forms to strain are highly relevant. Methodological pieces that develop short instruments or indices to capture Arbeitsbelastung are relevant because they operationalize the concept. A document is non-relevant if it uses “Arbeitsbelastung” only as a passing label or metaphor, discusses institutional “workload” without reference to employees’ strain or health, or focuses on unrelated “loads” (e.g., environmental burdens) without tying them to work demands. Edge cases include sectors like public administration or education: they are relevant if they connect high workload to staff well-being or performance, and borderline if the term appears only in keywords with no substantive analysis.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks studies and datasets on work-related workload (Arbeitsbelastung) in Germany—how it is measured, its determinants (e.g., tasks, hours, shift work), and its effects on health and job satisfaction across occupations and sectors. They likely want comparable survey variables and findings spanning multiple German workforce surveys.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it examines occupational workload (Arbeitsbelastung) in a concrete way—e.g., measuring perceived strain, time pressure, stress, overtime, shift/night/weekend work, high work speed, or physical/psychological demands—and links these to jobs, sectors, or worker outcomes. Clear examples include surveys of managers’ task loads and time allocation; the BIBB/BAuA Erwerbstätigenbefragung 2018 that records Arbeitsbelastungen, stress, overwork, speed and decision latitude; studies of chemie workers noting “besondere Arbeitsbelastungen”; and sectoral or demographic studies (e.g., women in agriculture, farm operators, or lifestyle/health panels) that explicitly ask about Arbeitsbelastung and its health or satisfaction effects. Documents are also relevant when workload appears as a variable alongside working hours, job satisfaction, or health (e.g., “Arbeitsbelastungen und deren Auswirkungen auf den Gesundheitszustand,” “empfundene Arbeitsbelastung” in leisure or sport modules), even if the main topic is broader. Non‑relevant items merely name the term in a long topic list without operational measures or analysis, or use “Belastung” in non‑work contexts (school sport, neighborhood noise) with no link to employment; household or parental “workload” is borderline unless tied to occupational demands. Edge cases where “Arbeitsbelastung” appears only in interviewer ratings or as a minor sub‑item are weakly relevant unless they provide data or findings on workload.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for a short paragraph about "Arbeitsbelastung" (workload/occupational stress). They likely want a concise explanation defining the term and summarizing common causes, effects, and/or strategies to manage it, suitable for a report or assignment.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "arbeitsbelastung" when it addresses workload or occupational strain directly—discussing causes, measurements, health effects, legal duties, or interventions for work-related stress (for example a study measuring nurses’ workload, a company risk assessment, or guidance under Arbeitsschutzgesetz). Highly relevant texts include empirical papers with measurements or questionnaires (COPSOQ, surveys, physiological metrics), workplace case studies, occupational health guidance, or legal/regulatory discussions that explicitly use the term or close synonyms like "Belastung am Arbeitsplatz" or "Überlastung." Non-relevant documents merely containing the word once in passing, advertising copy that mentions workload without substantive content, or papers using "Arbeit" in the physics sense (work/energy) or discussing CPU/server load are not relevant to human occupational workload. Edge cases arise when the domain is ambiguous (IT/system "workload" vs. human "Arbeitsbelastung"), when only translations or metadata include the term, or when related topics such as "Arbeitszeit" or general stress are discussed without linking to work-specific burden—these require checking context to decide relevance. Practical signals of strong relevance are explicit populations, methods, outcomes, statistics, or intervention descriptions; weak signals are single-word occurrences, unrelated domains, or mere bibliographic mentions.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly discusses Arbeitsbelastung as workplace burden/workload, especially in nursing, and describes concrete dimensions such as coordination and information problems or psychophysical overload. Highly relevant examples include German occupational surveys (e.g., BIBB/BAuA Erwerbstätigenbefragung 2016/2018), scales grounded in motivation and stress theories, and instrument development or pretests using cognitive interviews that measure perceived workload and its health impacts. Content that addresses related terms like Arbeitsstress, Belastungen am Arbeitsplatz, task demands, or training/qualification in explicit relation to workload also fits. Non-relevant items are those where “Belastung” refers to unrelated domains (financial, legal, environmental, mechanical/computing load) or nursing texts that do not analyze or measure workload. Edge cases include job ads or policy statements that merely note “hohe Arbeitsbelastung” without definitions, dimensions, or findings (only marginally relevant), while studies in other occupations can still be relevant if they operationalize workload in comparable ways.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks sociological research on “Arbeit” (work) that examines evolving definitions and forms of work—such as knowledge, emotional, cooperative, and biographical labor—along with entgrenzung, technological change, and blurred work–life boundaries. They also want analyses of work quality, health and violence links, and the political, gender, educational, and professionalization implications for modern labor.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “arbeit” when it substantively discusses work/labor in the German context—such as employment, labor organization, social work, or theories of work—and uses the term “Arbeit” or close morphological variants. Compounds and derivatives like Arbeitswelt, Wissensarbeit, Soziale Arbeit, Entgrenzung der Arbeit, Arbeitssucht, or indices like Gute Arbeit indicate strong relevance because they center on work concepts, conditions, or policies. By contrast, incidental or boilerplate mentions, occurrences only in metadata, or substring matches where “arbeit” appears inside words without a labor-related meaning (e.g., Bearbeitung for generic “processing,” or a proper name/URL) are weakly or non-relevant unless the surrounding context ties them to labor. Edge cases include broadened theoretical uses such as Emotionsarbeit or biographische Arbeit, which are still relevant because they conceptualize forms of work, whereas idiomatic quotes or passing mentions without analysis are not. Documents in other languages that only use “work” would typically be non-relevant for the exact keyword unless the system applies synonym or translation expansion; conversely, high density of “Arbeit” across headings and analysis suggests strong relevance.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking comprehensive German datasets and studies on work, including attitudes, job characteristics and conditions, wages and working-time statistics, and labor policies, with coverage of digitalization/home office effects (e.g., work addiction), shift work, and OSH management (ESENER), plus historical series for West/East Germany. The goal is to identify survey instruments, indices, and time series that measure these aspects over time.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it primarily concerns work or employment, such as job content and conditions, wages and working time, workplace organization, worker attitudes, or labor market policies. Examples include surveys on job satisfaction or shift work, analyses of home office and workaholism, official wage and hours statistics across sectors, studies of occupational safety and psychosocial risks (e.g., ESENER), and research on “Arbeiten 4.0” and digitalization. German compounds containing the root, such as Arbeitsbedingungen, Arbeitszeit, Arbeitszufriedenheit, or Arbeitsdisziplin, are relevant when they analyze workplace factors, remuneration, or workforce behavior. A document is non-relevant if “Arbeit” appears only incidentally or in a different sense, for instance academic papers (Seminararbeit), the physics term for mechanical work, a historical slogan without labor analysis, or a personal surname. Edge cases like housework/unpaid care or general digitalization debates count as relevant only when they substantively address labor practices, worker outcomes, or employment structures rather than merely mentioning the word.</narr>

They likely want translations, definitions, or a mapped list of those survey questions/variable codes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "arbeit" when it directly addresses employment- or work-related topics such as job satisfaction, working conditions, survey items about working under time pressure, part‑time employment reasons, voluntary continued work (e.g. "Angenommen Sie bekämen weiter Ihr Geld... freiwillig weiter zu arbeiten"), country of work, or comparisons between public and private sector employment; questionnaire forms, labor‑force statistics, HR policies and survey code lists (V99, V90, Q16, V922 etc.) are strong matches. Relevant examples include a survey instrument containing questions like "Wie zufrieden sind Sie alles in allem genommen mit Ihrer Arbeit", a research report on time pressure at work, or a dataset column list describing employment variables. Non‑relevant documents merely containing the string "Arbeit" but about other domains—physics/engineering work (mechanical Arbeit = force×distance), artistic works, metaphorical uses, or pages where the word appears only in passing or as noise—should be excluded. Edge cases to watch for are bilingual documents or translated questionnaires (German/English), political items that ask whether parties "do their work" (e.g. "Macht die SPD in der Bundesregierung ihre Arbeit") which may be borderline depending on intent, and terse codebooks where variable names (V99, V133) appear without explanatory text but still signal potentially relevant survey data.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “arbeit” if it discusses work or employment, such as job satisfaction, work orientation, occupational attitudes, or job characteristics, and it often contains compounds like Arbeitszufriedenheit, Arbeitsleben, or beruflicher Arbeit. The provided paragraph is relevant because it includes work-focused scales and constructs (e.g., Allgemeine Arbeitszufriedenheit, Arbeitsorientierung, Perzipierte Tätigkeitsmerkmale like Aufgabenvielfalt, Entscheidungsspielraum, psychische Jobanforderungen) and an instrument covering attitudes toward work and the workplace. By contrast, mentions of “Arbeiten” meaning “the works/publications of” (e.g., basiert auf den Arbeiten von Schwartz) or unrelated uses like Arbeitsspeicher (computer memory) or physical “work” in physics are non-relevant false positives. Edge cases include generic uses of the verb arbeiten (“to work on something”) without an employment context, domain-specific terms like Sozialarbeit or Hausarbeit, and surnames that look similar but are unrelated; however, phrases like beruflicher Arbeit or synonyms such as Beruf, Job, or Beschäftigung, and morphological variants (arbeiten, Arbeiter, Arbeits-) generally indicate relevance.</narr>

They want to understand how factors like age, gender, work design (e.g., home office), health interventions, and evolving employment models influence performance and its recognition.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly analyzes, measures, regulates, or empirically reports on Arbeitsleistung (work performance), for example studies on age and performance, wellbeing interventions that change performance, home-office intensity and performance, gender bias in performance evaluation, or labor-law/collective agreements that reduce or reallocate required work performance (e.g., partial release from duties, unpaid overtime of physicians). Content that models or steers performance (shirking models, hierarchical control, seniority promotions, crowdsourcing that reorganizes how performance is produced and rewarded) is also relevant, as are sectoral cases (farmers’ high workload, foreign correspondents’ performance constraints) when they explain drivers, measurement, or consequences of performance. Documents are non-relevant if they only mention the term in passing, or discuss adjacent topics like working time, employment status, or retirement without tying them to performance outputs, evaluation, productivity, or management of performance. Edge cases include macro-level uses (societal “allocation of Arbeitsleistungen”), plural or related terms (Leistungsbeurteilung, Leistungsfähigkeit, Produktivität), and normative debates; these remain relevant when they inform how performance is defined, assessed, or influenced. Conversely, general wellbeing or organizational culture pieces are only relevant if they establish a concrete linkage to changes in Arbeitsleistung.</narr>

<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks research and survey information on work performance (Arbeitsleistung)—its determinants, motivation, evaluation, and self/supervisor assessments—across different worker groups, especially in the former GDR. They want how social, political, and workplace conditions (e.g., collective norms, training, shift work) influence performance in sectors like industry, agriculture, and transport.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it analyzes, measures, or explains Arbeitsleistung (job/work performance), including self- or supervisor ratings, norm fulfillment, productivity, performance motivation, awards, absenteeism/“Fehltage,” shift work, microelectronics or rationalization at the workplace, training/Weiterbildung, and collective dynamics in DDR contexts (e.g., FDJ, SED, Jugendbrigade, MMM/Neuererbewegung) insofar as they affect performance. Studies of young workers’ motives for Leistungsstreben, readiness to switch jobs, work optimization, or plan fulfillment, as well as sectoral cases like agricultural seasonal performance or professional drivers’ safety behavior under performance pressure, are strong matches. Documents that only present demographics, housing, leisure, or general political attitudes are non-relevant unless they explicitly link those factors to work performance outcomes or evaluation (e.g., how ideology or peace attitudes relate to Planerfüllung or Leistungsbewertung). Edge cases include brief or tangential mentions of “Arbeitsleistung,” use of close synonyms (Leistungsbewertung, Produktivität, Normerfüllung, Leistungsmotivation) which still qualify, and items about academic performance (e.g., grades, Leistungsstipendium) or sports fandom, which are off-topic unless tied to workplace output.</narr>

They may be seeking a clear translation, definition, or guidance for answering the survey item.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "arbeitsleistung" when it actually discusses work performance — for example evaluations of employee productivity, links between pay and performance, performance metrics, or self‑assessments of one’s Arbeitsleistung. The given paragraph directly asks whether income matches one’s abilities and Arbeitsleistung, so it is highly relevant because it contains the term in a substantive, topical question rather than only as metadata. Non‑relevant documents might only contain the token as a repeated label or code (e.g., V192, V390) or use the word in an unrelated technical sense (like machine output) without addressing human work performance. Edge cases include survey forms that list the phrase as a question but provide no further context, documents using synonyms or compounds (e.g., Arbeitsleistungsprämie) that require semantic matching, misspellings or translations, and duplicate boilerplate that inflates term frequency without adding meaningful content.</narr>

They may also want examples and practical ways to assess or improve employee productivity.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "arbeitsleistung" if it explicitly discusses work performance or the amount of work delivered—e.g., HR guidance on employee performance evaluation, employment contract clauses about duties or performance-based pay, measurement methods for productivity, or German case law and statutes interpreting an employee’s duty to render Arbeitsleistung. Useful signals of relevance are the term appearing in the title or headings, presence of definitions, examples of how performance is measured (KPIs, output metrics), sample contract language, or citations of labor law (collective agreements, Betriebsvereinbarungen, court decisions). Non-relevant documents merely mentioning the word in passing, focusing on unrelated meanings (for example technical literature about electrical "Leistung" = power, or physics discussions of work and energy that don’t concern labor), or poor machine translations that garble context should be excluded. Edge cases include ambiguity between legal/HR intent and scientific usage, compound words or variants (e.g., "Erbringung der Arbeitsleistung", "Arbeitsleistungspflicht"), and documents in other languages — in those cases look for surrounding context (contract, employer/employee, KPIs, statute citations) to disambiguate relevance.</narr>

It also aims to understand their health impacts (burnout, stress, absenteeism/presenteeism) and implications for integrating these issues into occupational safety and prevention policies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively investigates Arbeitsbelastungen—physical or psychosocial work burdens, quantitative/qualitative workload, or stressors—by describing their measurement, prevalence, determinants (e.g., shift work, reorganization, flexible contracts), or consequences (e.g., burnout, absenteeism/presenteeism, health risks). Examples of strong relevance include multi-industry surveys on employees’ exposures and OSH policy responses, hospital nursing studies linking reorganization to workload and burnout, validated indices or short instruments for assessing Arbeitsbelastung (e.g., ABges/ABphy/ABpsy, KFZA), and analyses of sector-specific burdens (police, service sector, older workers). Documents are non-relevant when “Arbeitsbelastung” is only mentioned in passing while the focus lies elsewhere (e.g., political education in schools or municipal offices’ performance without real analysis of work strain), or when content is a broad A&O psychology overview that doesn’t address workload explicitly. Edge cases: historical accounts of factory work or early surveys are relevant if they analyze workload/strain dimensions; youth or general health surveys are partially relevant if they include a dedicated section on working respondents’ burdens; studies on social support and stress count if they explicitly tie effects to chronic work-related burdens, but narratives about personal career changes with incidental “new workloads” do not.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses work-related burdens, such as perceived workload, stress, time pressure, overwork, or physical/psychological strains at the workplace, including sections or variables labeled Arbeitsbelastung/Arbeitsbelastungen. Examples include surveys of managers, agricultural workers, or industrial employees that measure workload, shift/night/weekend work, overtime, hazardous exposures, or job demands, as well as datasets that list “Arbeitsbelastung” among topics or scales. Content using clear proxies for workload (Arbeitsdruck, hohe Arbeitsgeschwindigkeit, Zeitdruck, Schichtarbeit) or instruments assessing job strain also qualifies. Non-relevant are uses of “Belastung” outside the work context (e.g., environmental load, sports training load) or documents that discuss only working time or general well-being without tying it to job demands. Edge cases include brief mentions of Arbeitsbelastung in a long topic list—these are still relevant if they indicate a measured variable, and morphological or synonymous variants (Arbeitsbelastung, Arbeitsbelastungen, Belastungen bei der Arbeit) should be treated as matches.</narr>

Relevant examples include German-language occupational health reports, company risk assessments mentioning "Arbeitsbelastungen," research papers comparing workload across professions, or guides for works councils on reducing job strain. A document is non-relevant if the term appears only in passing, is used in a different sense (e.g., structural engineering loads, financial burdens unrelated to work), or if it treats unrelated populations without workplace context (e.g., student homework load only). Edge cases include materials about unpaid care work or home-office stress—these can be relevant if framed as "work" or occupational burden—and translations or singular/plural variants ("Arbeitsbelastung"/"arbeitsbelastungen") should be treated as matching the same topic.</narr>

Content focusing on specific sectors such as nursing, workplace demands, health impacts, or training/education related to managing workload also fits. Documents that use “Belastung” in non-work contexts (mechanical load, environmental load), or discuss employment broadly without addressing workload, are not relevant. Edge cases include texts that only mention the term in passing (e.g., in a keyword list) without substantive discussion, or materials about student homework load rather than occupational workload; synonyms like Arbeitsanforderungen, Beanspruchung, gesundheitliche Beeinträchtigungen, job strain, or workload in English can still indicate relevance.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively examines antisemitism—its prevalence, causes, forms, measurements, or impacts—such as national case studies (e.g., Poland or Hungary), large-scale surveys (Eurobarometer, FRA, German Integrationsbarometer), analyses of online hate speech (Decoding Antisemitism), or frameworks and datasets (e.g., DIMA). Research on education and lived experience (e.g., Jewish students in schools) or on long-run consequences of historical antisemitism (e.g., effects on financial behavior) is also relevant, as are pieces that debate the concept’s meaning, politicization, or its relationship to other prejudices. Documents are non-relevant when they only mention the term in passing, use “antisemitic” metaphorically without addressing Jew-hatred, focus solely on other forms of bias without linking them to antisemitism, or discuss the Holocaust/WWII without engaging antisemitism as a phenomenon. Edge cases include materials that contain antisemitic rhetoric: these can be relevant as evidence or examples if documented and analyzed, though some systems may exclude them for safety; likewise, studies on xenophobia or right-wing populism are relevant only when they explicitly connect those trends to antisemitism.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses antisemitism—its prevalence, forms (hate crime, hate speech, discrimination), experiences, or perceptions—and presents concrete data or analysis, such as the FRA’s 2018 survey of 16,395 Jewish respondents across 12 EU countries on harassment, safety, reporting, and behavioral impacts. It also counts as relevant when it measures attitudes or discourse about antisemitism in politics, media, or online spaces (including Israel-related antisemitism), for example survey items probing stereotypes or denial (e.g., “Jews have too much power,” “the Holocaust is a myth,” support for boycotts). Documents become non-relevant when “antisemitism” is merely a passing mention within a long list of unrelated topics (media use, economics, general politics) without specific questions, indicators, findings, or legal context tied to antisemitism. Edge cases include mixed-topic datasets like Eurobarometer or ALLBUS; these are relevant if they describe the antisemitism module’s content, measures, or results, but not if they only name the topic among many keywords. Content on legal frameworks (Holocaust denial laws, hate-speech provisions), Jewish community security, or incidents like vandalism of Jewish sites is relevant, whereas purely methodological notes without antisemitism-specific measures are not.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly addresses whether antisemitism is perceived as a problem in the specified country and whether that perception has changed over the past five years — for example national polls, NGO or government reports, survey questionnaires and their results, or news analyses explicitly asking or measuring those questions. Relevant examples include public-opinion surveys that ask “Is antisemitism a problem in our country?” and trend reports comparing perceptions year-by-year, as well as academic studies that analyze perceived increases or decreases in the last five years. Non-relevant documents are ones that only define antisemitism, discuss historical episodes outside the five-year window, treat antisemitism generically at a global level without country-specific perception data, or report individual incidents without linking them to overall public perception or trend analysis. Edge cases include crime-statistic reports and policy briefs — they are partially relevant if they tie numbers to public perception or show a five-year trend, and materials in other languages or using synonyms (e.g., “anti‑Semitism,” “Judeophobia”) should be considered relevant if they cover the same survey or trend questions.</narr>

	<narr>Relevant documents explicitly treat antisemitism by defining it, presenting survey items or scales about antisemitic attitudes, reporting prevalence or trends, or describing the testing and adaptation of antisemitism questions (for example, cognitive pretests or Allbus evaluations of antisemitism items). Documents that only list antisemitism among many topics without giving item wordings, results, or measurement detail are less relevant because they do not enable assessment of how antisemitism was operationalized. Methodological reports about web probing or panel design are relevant only when they discuss the antisemitism items specifically; otherwise they are incidental. Edge cases include translated questionnaires or metadata-only datasets — these are useful if they preserve original German item wordings or provide clear variable descriptions, but are only partially relevant if they lack the actual items or results.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it centers on Ausländer (foreigners/foreign nationals), for example analyzing attitudes toward foreigners in Germany, integration processes, rights and legal status, demographic patterns, or theories like group threat, relative deprivation, social identity, and the contact hypothesis. Highly relevant examples include ALLBUS-based studies of xenophobia in 2016 showing contact effects and East–West differences, evaluations of support for equal rights or municipal voting rights for foreigners, and discussions of contact with foreigners in family, neighborhood, and workplaces. Non-relevant or weakly relevant items include content about Ausland (abroad) such as Germans emigrating, or BND “Ausland-Ausland” surveillance law, where the word “Ausländer” may appear but the core topic is emigration or telecommunications policy rather than foreigners as a social group. Edge cases include edited volumes that merely list “Ausländer” among many themes (only marginally relevant), or texts using near-synonyms (Migranten, ausländische Staatsbürger) or gendered/plural forms (Ausländerinnen und Ausländer)—these are relevant when the substantive focus remains on foreigners. Materials on vocational training, media, or education are relevant if they specifically analyze or target foreigners; generic mentions without sustained analysis are not.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses foreigners (Ausländer) in Germany—especially attitudes, contacts, integration, rights, or conflicts—such as surveys on East Germans’ relations to foreigners, media portrayals of migrants, support for voting rights for foreigners, asylum policy, or measures of the Ausländeranteil. Examples include questionnaires about contact frequency with foreigners at work or in neighborhoods, opinions on a Zuzugsstopp, evaluations of Fremdenfeindlichkeit or Rassismus, or city studies (e.g., Duisburg, Trier) assessing German–foreigner relations. Documents are non-relevant if they focus on unrelated topics and only mention “Ausländer” in passing, or if “foreigners” refers to people outside the German context without linking to attitudes, integration, or policy in Germany. Edge cases that should still count include pieces using related terms or synonyms (Migranten, Zuwanderer, Gastarbeiter, Ausländerfeindlichkeit), or historical/foreign datasets (e.g., a Russian census) that explicitly report on “foreigners” as a category. Conversely, media or lifestyle studies are only relevant when they include explicit items about foreigners (e.g., Wahlrecht für Ausländer, Kontakt zu Ausländern); otherwise they should be excluded.</narr>

	<desc>The user is looking for survey questions and responses about "foreigners" in Germany, specifically whether a respondent has a parent born abroad and how people perceive relations between foreigners and Germans in their neighborhood. They also want opinions on immigration policy (whether entry/zuzug for foreigners should be eased or restricted) and general perceptions of most foreigners living in Germany.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "ausländer" if it directly discusses foreigners, immigration, or attitudes toward foreigners—especially survey items asking about relationships between Ausländer and Germans, parental origin, or whether immigration should be eased or restricted. It is non-relevant if the term appears only incidentally (e.g., a single offhand mention), if the document focuses on an unrelated topic, or if "Ausländer" is used in a different sense (such as a surname, place name, or metaphor). Repetitive questionnaire text like the provided paragraph is still relevant because it contains the exact survey questions and response context, though duplicate lines reduce informational value. Edge cases include OCR or translation errors that fragment the word (e.g., "Ausl." or "Ausl ander") which may require normalization to match, and legal or historical documents that use related terms (e.g., "Ausländergesetz")—these can be relevant if the query intent is policy rather than social attitudes. Useful signals of relevance are presence of question phrasing, demographic fields, and policy wording; non-relevance signals are metaphorical uses, unrelated topics, or ambiguous homographs.</narr>

	<desc>The user is looking for German social survey resources on “Ausländer,” including standardized ALLBUS items and scales measuring attitudes toward foreigners (and related topics like antisemitism), plus standard variables for citizenship and work permits. They also seek documentation on instrument development and cognitive pretests, along with best practices for mixed-device and mobile survey implementation.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly addresses Ausländer (foreigners) in Germany—for example, defining the term, describing integration, legal rights and status differences (citizenship, work permits, EU vs third-country nationals), or reporting survey items and results about attitudes toward Ausländer (e.g., ALLBUS scales). Content about standardized questionnaire items for citizenship and work authorization in German studies is relevant, as are discussions that analyze or pretest questions on “Ausländer” attitudes. Methodological texts (like mixed-device or mobile survey guidelines) are only relevant if they explicitly connect methods to measuring opinions or experiences of Ausländer; otherwise they are non-relevant. Mentions of closely related terms (ausländische Bevölkerung, Migranten/Zuwanderer, Unionsbürger, Drittstaatenangehörige) count, while references to other topics (e.g., antisemitism or “Juden”) are non-relevant unless directly linked to foreigners. Edge cases include documents that use “Ausländer” only in passing or outside the German context, which may be marginally relevant or not relevant depending on whether they provide substantive information about foreigners in Germany.</narr>

<title>wohlfahrtsstaat</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an academic overview of the welfare state—its conceptual and constitutional foundations and “theory deficit,” key legitimations and critiques, and its social and economic impacts. They want comparative and empirical evidence across countries and contexts (market efficiency, freedom, inclusion, globalization, gender, public acceptance, crime risk, democracy, and historical cases).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it treats the Wohlfahrtsstaat (welfare state) as a political-institutional arrangement or policy regime, discussing its theories, legitimacy, expansion or retrenchment, and comparative performance. Examples of relevance include cross-national comparisons (e.g., Sweden/Netherlands vs. USA/Japan), debates over freedom, efficiency, and inclusion, empirical work on public acceptance, globalization’s impact, gendered outcomes, or sectoral analyses of housing, education, and health explicitly framed as features of the welfare state. Historical and constitutional treatments (such as the Nazi welfare state, or arguments about the Sozialstaat’s legal basis) and discourse-analytic pieces on the semantics of the welfare state also qualify. Edge cases: texts using synonyms or variants (Sozialstaat, wohlfahrtsstaatlich) are relevant, while items about generic “welfare” or charity (Wohlfahrt), private philanthropy, or brand names like Käthe Wohlfahrt are not. Content on crime, immigration, or budgets is only relevant if it explicitly links these outcomes to welfare-state design, functions, or legitimacy; otherwise it should be considered non-relevant.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking information on the welfare state, especially its social insurance institutions, historical development in Germany and Western Europe, and survey-based evidence on public attitudes, inequality, and policy preferences. They may want datasets and analyses (e.g., ALLBUS, ISSP) that track opinions and changes over time.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “wohlfahrtsstaat” if it substantively analyzes welfare-state institutions or policies (e.g., social insurance, health, pensions, unemployment), reports on public attitudes toward the welfare state, or presents comparative data on welfare-state spending, coverage, or financing. Clear positives include survey modules explicitly titled “Soziale Ungleichheit und Wohlfahrtsstaat” in ALLBUS (1984, 1994, 2014), the panel “Attitudes and Reported Experiences of the German Welfare State,” or historical/comparative works like Jens Alber’s analyses of social security expansion in Western Europe. Materials that only mention the welfare state in passing—such as broad political surveys where “Wohlfahrtsstaat” appears once in a long topic list or education-policy studies that note cuts “in other parts of the welfare state” without deeper treatment—are weakly relevant. Edge cases include documents using near-synonyms (social security, social insurance, expenditure ratios) that still directly pertain to welfare-state structures, and datasets where “Wohlfahrtsstaat” is one of several co-equal topics—here relevance depends on the depth and dedicated measures or tables provided.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is seeking to measure attitudes toward the welfare state in Germany by presenting a list of statements about social inequalities and the role of state and economy; for each statement they want respondents to indicate one of four agreement levels (fully agree, rather agree, rather disagree, or completely disagree).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "wohlfahrtsstaat" when it directly discusses the welfare state, social inequality, or the role of the state in providing social protection — for example policy analyses, descriptions of social transfers, or surveys of public attitudes toward social spending. The provided paragraph repeatedly asks respondents about "Staat und Wirtschaft" and "soziale Unterschiede," so it is relevant insofar as it gathers opinions tied to welfare‑state issues, but it contains little substantive analysis or concrete policy content. A non‑relevant document would only mention the word in passing, be unrelated (e.g., technical manuals, ads), or consist mainly of boilerplate repetition and spam that add no topical information. Edge cases include texts that treat "wohlfahrtsstaat" historically or comparatively (partially relevant) or questionnaires and survey prompts like this one (relevant for public opinion research but lower value for policy detail). Overall, this paragraph is topically on‑target but of limited usefulness without the actual statements or responses.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses the welfare state (Wohlfahrtsstaat/Sozialstaat), its functions or benefits, or public attitudes toward it. Content such as survey instruments (e.g., an eight-item scale of welfare-state attitudes), links to left–right political self-placement, opinions on income inequality and redistribution, cross-national projects like PAWCER, and methodological details (e.g., cognitive interviews) all strengthen relevance. Material about climate change or energy is only relevant if explicitly connected to welfare-state attitudes within the same research context. Non-relevant items include texts that merely name “Wohlfahrtsstaat” without analysis, use “Wohlfahrt” to mean charity or general well-being, or discuss unrelated “welfare” topics (e.g., animal or corporate welfare) or political scales without tying them to the welfare state. Edge cases: documents using the synonym “Sozialstaat,” in other languages but clearly about the welfare state, or comparative studies across countries are relevant, while purely ideological measures without redistribution or welfare-state linkage are borderline.</narr>

<title>arbeitsweg</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking research and statistics on work commutes, including travel time and distance trends, factors shaping mode choice and willingness to commute or relocate, and how patterns differ by gender, family situation, and urban–rural context in Germany.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “arbeitsweg” if it focuses on the commute to work, such as discussing commute time or distance, commuting patterns (e.g., rising shares of 25+ km trips), mode choice on the way to work, or factors shaping commuting for specific groups like dual‑career couples or gender differences. Studies that analyze willingness to accept a long commute when job searching, the impact of corporate relocations on employees’ travel to work, or interventions promoting sustainable modes for the work trip also count as relevant. Content that only mentions “Arbeitsweg” in passing within a broader, unrelated topic (e.g., fertility or life‑satisfaction surveys where commute length is just one of many variables) is only marginally relevant. Edge cases include documents using synonyms like “Pendeln” or “Weg zur Arbeit,” which should be treated as relevant, while texts about school commutes or household/child‑related trips without clear linkage to the work commute are non‑relevant. International cases (e.g., East Midlands in England) can still be relevant if the focus is the daily commute to work rather than the locale.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking information on commuting to work (Arbeitsweg), including commute duration/distance, transportation modes used, and the perceived burden of the commute, as documented in surveys on housing, mobility, and employment.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “arbeitsweg” when it explicitly addresses the commute to work, such as the duration or length of the commute, the perceived burden or stress from commuting, and the transportation modes used for the daily trip to the workplace. Mentions like “Arbeitsort und -weg,” “Belastung durch Arbeitsweg,” “Dauer/Länge des Arbeitswegs in Minuten,” “genutztes Verkehrsmittel für den täglichen Arbeitsweg,” or “maximal akzeptabler Arbeitsweg” are strong indicators of relevance, including contexts like changes in commute after moving or combining the commute with errands. Content that discusses transport use for multiple purposes (e.g., weekend recreation, shopping, and for the Arbeitsweg) is relevant if the work-commute aspect is explicitly included, but becomes less relevant if it only covers non-work trips. Pure housing, neighborhood, or leisure topics without any link to getting to work, or tangential items like “time to reach the garage” or “parking distance” without reference to the work trip, are non-relevant. Edge cases include metaphorical uses of “Arbeitsweg” (career path, not physical commute), home office situations resulting in zero commute, or unemployment panels where only the last job’s commute is described—these can still be relevant if they quantify or describe the work commute explicitly.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for a clear explanation of the survey item asking whether health problems would make it difficult to get to their workplace. In other words, it seeks to determine if physical or health-related limitations would prevent or complicate commuting to a job.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "arbeitsweg" if it directly addresses the commute or the ability to reach the workplace — for example survey items like EF1092u1 or Frage 170 that ask “Hätten Sie bei einer Erwerbstätigkeit Probleme, Ihren Arbeitsplatz zu erreichen (Arbeitsweg)?” or text about mobility, public transport, driving, distance, or health-related barriers to commuting. Concrete markers of relevance include the exact phrasing shown, variable codes (EF1092u1), question numbers, and discussions of accessibility problems (e.g., mobility impairment, lack of transit). Non-relevant documents are those that only use the word in passing with a different meaning (metaphorical uses of “work path”), focus solely on pay/reimbursement rules without commute context, or contain the token as part of unrelated metadata. Edge cases include texts with encoding artifacts (e.g., “auml”) or translations — these can still be relevant if the surrounding context clearly describes reaching the workplace; similarly, synonyms like “Anfahrtsweg” or the phrase “Arbeitsplatz erreichen” should be treated as relevant even if the exact keyword form is absent.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking information about “Arbeitsweg” (the commute to work), specifically the duration of the commute as addressed in the PIAAC Round 2 pretest, including how this is asked or measured in the survey.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly addresses the commute to work (Arbeitsweg), such as the duration, distance, travel time, route, transportation mode, or costs—for example, survey content that explicitly includes “Dauer des Arbeitsweges,” as in this PIAAC pretest. Study or methodology descriptions are also relevant when they measure or analyze commuting behaviors or times, even if the primary topic is broader. Synonyms and variants like Pendeln, Weg zur Arbeit, Fahrt-/Wegezeit, Anfahrtsweg, Pendelstrecke, or plural forms (Arbeitswege) also indicate relevance. Non-relevant content would use “Arbeitsweg” metaphorically (e.g., career path), discuss work methods (“Weg der Arbeit”), or focus on unrelated topics (e.g., team work) without a clear link to commuting; legal discussions of accidents on the way to work are borderline and only relevant if they analyze the commute itself. Here, the paragraph is relevant because it specifies survey questions about the duration of the commute.</narr>

<title>gesundheitszustand</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking research and statistics on health status—particularly in Germany—how it is measured, its trends, and how it varies by age, gender, socioeconomic status, family structure, and employment. They also want insights into implications for working beyond retirement and for reducing health inequalities in public health policy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly examines, measures, or analyzes Gesundheitszustand (health status) in individuals or populations, whether objectively (medical assessments, morbidity) or subjectively (self-rated health), including determinants, trends, and disparities. Examples include analyses of older adults’ willingness to work by health status, EU-SILC or KiGGS findings on self-rated health and chronic limitations by income, education, or employment, cohort or longitudinal results (e.g., Bonner gerontological study), and migration patterns like the “healthy migrant effect.” Methodological pieces that define or critique how health status is measured (e.g., healthy life expectancy/GLE and its sensitivity to definitions and data sources) are also relevant. A document is non-relevant if it only mentions health status in passing as context (e.g., as one of many recruitment risks for the military) or focuses solely on behaviors/policies without linking them to measured or explicitly discussed health status. Edge cases such as discussions of personal responsibility in aging or socioeconomic status and family structure are relevant when they present data or analysis tying these factors to subjective/objective health status, but not when they are purely anecdotal or theoretical.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking information on health status, including how it is measured and influenced by lifestyle, work, and social factors. They are interested in self-rated health, chronic conditions, functional limitations, psychosocial impacts, and healthcare utilization, particularly as captured in German population surveys of seniors, workers, patients, and families.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it reports, assesses, or analyzes health status, for example via self-rated health (“Selbsteinschätzung des Gesundheitszustands”), interviewer-observed status (“sichtbarer Gesundheitszustand”), functional limitations (mobility, vision, hearing, arm function), or clinician-reported “Gesundheitszustand des Patienten.” Also relevant are surveys that tie behaviors and conditions to current, past, or expected health status, such as chronic diseases, disability, hospitalizations, medication use, work strain, smoking, alcohol, diet, and sport, as well as seniors’ or patients’ general health and well-being. Documents are non-relevant if they only address healthcare logistics or system features (waiting times, practice location, insurance details) without describing or measuring health status, or if they focus solely on life satisfaction without a health component. Edge cases include listings where “Gesundheitszustand” appears as a topic but the content provides no actual measures, or mentions of others’ health (partners, parents); these are borderline unless they include concrete assessments of health status for a defined population.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The query seeks the meaning and typical survey phrasing of the German term "Gesundheitszustand"—specifically how to ask people to rate their general health (e.g., "How would you describe your state of health in general?"). The user likely needs a clear translation or alternative phrasings for use in questionnaires or interviews.</desc>
	<narr>This document is highly relevant to the query "gesundheitszustand" because it repeatedly contains the exact keyword and numerous direct survey items asking respondents to describe their general state of health, including variants such as "Wie würden Sie Ihren Gesundheitszustand im Allgemeinen beschreiben" and child-focused prompts ("Wie ist der Gesundheitszustand des Kindes im Allgemeinen"). The presence of survey variable codes (e.g., hs01, V241) and repeated question forms indicates it is part of a questionnaire or instrument, which is useful when the user wants examples of how health-status questions are worded. It becomes less relevant if the occurrence of the term is only incidental (for example a news story briefly mentioning someone’s Gesundheitszustand) or if the document only lists metadata codes without the actual question text or response options. Edge cases include mixed documents that combine survey items with news about a public figure’s health (e.g., Angela Merkel): those are partly relevant for wording examples but may be misleading if the user seeks aggregated measurements or answers rather than question wording.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user wants to know how the study measures "Gesundheitszustand" — specifically which survey items (self-rated health compared with peers, relative timing preferences for illness, and the estimated probability of using preventive care) are used to predict skin‑cancer screening decisions. They also want to know these items were pretested via face‑to‑face cognitive interviews (with simultaneous interpreters by video) in Serbian, Arabic, Farsi, Russian and English as part of the RESPOND project on asylum‑seeker care.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword gesundheitszustand if it explicitly addresses health status or measures of it — for example self-rated health, comparisons with peers, clinical condition, or survey items asking about one’s own health. The paragraph is relevant because it directly mentions “Einschätzung der eigenen Gesundheit im Vergleich mit Gleichaltrigen” and links preventive behavior (skin cancer screening) and perceived disease risk to respondents’ health perceptions. It would be non-relevant if the text only discusses unrelated topics (e.g., interpreter logistics, econometric methods, or general project administration) without content on health status. Edge cases include texts that do not use the German term but clearly measure health via screening uptake or risk-probability questions (still relevant), versus passages that mention the word only in passing or metaphorically (borderline or non-relevant).</narr>

<title>politisches wissen</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The query seeks research-based insight into “political knowledge”: how it is objectively defined and measured, how it is distributed across groups in Germany, and which factors (ability, education, motivation, media, region, language) shape it. It also asks how political knowledge affects trust, populism, and participation, drawing largely on ALLBUS 2008/2018 findings and implying implications for civic education.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly defines, measures, or analyzes political knowledge (politisches Wissen) as a concept or variable, including its determinants, distribution, and consequences. Strong signals include distinctions between knowledge and beliefs or attitudes, operationalizations of objective/factual knowledge versus self-assessed competence, and empirical studies (e.g., ALLBUS 2008/2018, school assessments like POWIS, EU election studies) linking political knowledge to outcomes such as participation, trust in institutions, or susceptibility to populism, as well as findings on media use, education/IQ, regional differences, or youth cohorts. Methodological discussions (measurement models, item batteries, structural equation modeling, eye-tracking of information search) and debates on civic education or the role of mass media in building political knowledge also count as clearly relevant when tied to knowledge acquisition or effects. By contrast, documents that discuss politics, political trust, or participation without conceptualizing or measuring political knowledge, use “wissen” only as a verb or in unrelated domains (e.g., scientific knowledge, epistemology), or offer purely normative commentary without engaging the knowledge construct are non-relevant. Edge cases include pieces on media literacy or economic insecurity that only mention knowledge in passing (marginal), and subgroup-specific studies (e.g., migrants, fifth graders, East–West) which are relevant when they explicitly assess political knowledge levels, determinants, or impacts.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks surveys and datasets measuring political knowledge, including instruments that capture citizens’ knowledge, interest, attitudes, and participation alongside voting behavior and media use. It spans multiple populations and contexts (notably Germany and the U.S.) and includes methodological details and demographics for analysis.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly measures, analyzes, or reports on political knowledge (politisches Wissen), such as tests or recall items about institutions, processes, parties, elections, or politicians—for example, knowing the 2005 governing coalition, identifying Spitzenkandidaten, understanding first vs. second vote, or knowledge scales among students. Studies where political knowledge is a defined variable within broader surveys (e.g., welfare-state attitudes including civics knowledge items, or online media panels that assess respondents’ political knowledge) are also relevant. By contrast, documents that only cover attitudes, trust, participation, voting behavior, or media use without any operationalization of knowledge are non-relevant, as are works about “Wissenschaftspolitik” (science policy) or research funding where “Wissen” refers to scientific knowledge rather than citizens’ knowledge about politics. Edge cases include knowledge about foreign systems (e.g., US civics) or historical regimes (Weimar, National Socialism): these are relevant if used to assess respondents’ political knowledge, but items like “ökonomisches Wissen” or “Wissen über den Nahostkonflikt” are only relevant when clearly framed as political knowledge constructs. Pure methodological notes, demographics, or coding details without knowledge content should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A concise description: The user wants to measure political knowledge and engagement—whether respondents can identify local politicians (name, party, residence), recall who said particular statements, and report which party (CDU or SPD) they think can solve problems like unemployment. They also want information on respondents' political activity frequency and family voting patterns.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "politisches wissen" when it explicitly measures or discusses citizens' factual political knowledge — for example asking respondents to name their elected representative, identify which party (CDU or SPD) could solve unemployment, recall dates of events, or report which party a family member typically votes for. The provided paragraph contains many such survey items (questions about unemployment, party responsibility, the name or party of the elected MP), so those parts are clearly relevant. Text that is non‑relevant would focus only on administrative script, repeated interviewer instructions, or on political attitudes and participation frequency without any factual knowledge tests. Edge cases include materials that mention "politisches Wissen" but only discuss political interest or behavior (these are partially relevant), or heavily noisy/transcribed documents where the substantive knowledge questions are buried among repetitions — such documents are relevant in substance but lower quality and may require cleaning.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks validated instruments and survey modules for measuring political knowledge and closely related socio-political constructs (e.g., efficacy, cynicism, conservatism) in German/European contexts. They want references and validation/pretest details for short scales and datasets such as PEKS, KPZ, SECS-GER, CSES, and related measures used in major panels.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “politisches Wissen” when it defines, measures, or analyzes citizens’ factual political knowledge—for example, quiz-style items about institutions, parties, policies, or the ability to correctly identify political actors—and when it presents validated instruments or datasets that include explicit political knowledge variables. Instruments that primarily assess attitudes or dispositions (e.g., political cynicism KPZ, conservatism SECS-GER, asylum-policy attitudes), perceived influence or self-efficacy (PEKS), or general/crystallized knowledge unrelated to politics (BEFKI GC-K) are non-relevant. Topic modules like CSES are relevant only if they contain knowledge test items; the described Module 5 pretest focuses on interest and attitudes (elites, immigration, redistribution) and thus is less relevant. Edge cases include studies on panel conditioning if they document effects on political knowledge responses, environmental “knowledge” scales that become relevant only when they test knowledge of political institutions/policies rather than physical ecology, and projects on inflation expectations that are relevant only if they measure understanding of monetary policy. Mentions of “politische Kompetenz” are relevant when operationalized as factual knowledge rather than self-assessed efficacy.</narr>

<title>populism</title>

	<desc>The user seeks scholarly explanations and definitions of populism, comparing conceptual approaches (e.g., ideology vs strategy) and clarifying its core features. They also want analysis of populism’s relationship with democracy—its potential benefits, risks, and how to distinguish it from ordinary democratic contestation.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly analyzes populism as a political phenomenon—its definitions, ideology, strategies, actors, rhetoric, or its relationship with democracy and institutions. For example, works that compare minimal definitions of populism (e.g., Mudde’s thin-centered ideology vs. Weyland’s strategy) or that examine how populism affects or corrects democratic practice are clearly on-topic. By contrast, texts about population demography—fertility, mortality, migration, gridded population datasets, urbanization, or “population transition” in countries—are non-relevant despite lexical overlap with “populism.” Edge cases include discussions of “population” in governmentality (e.g., Foucault) or uses of “popular”/“the people” that do not engage the populism literature; these should be treated as non-relevant unless they explicitly frame arguments around populism. Interdisciplinary studies (e.g., immigration levels, group threat, or trust) are relevant only if they explicitly link findings to populist parties, attitudes, or rhetoric; otherwise they remain demographic or sociological, not populism-focused.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks comprehensive historical demographic data and analyses for Germany and selected regions (e.g., Prussia, Vienna, North Rhine-Westphalia), including age/sex structure, fertility, mortality, migration, urbanization, and labor-force statistics across long time series. The goal is to examine population dynamics and their links to legal, economic, and social changes using sources such as the Federal Statistical Office and GESIS/HISTAT.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “populism” when it defines or analyzes populism as a political phenomenon (e.g., anti-elite rhetoric, populist leaders or parties, electoral support for AfD/Le Pen/Podemos, measurement of populist attitudes, or policy programs framed as “the people” vs. “the elite”) and provides theory, case studies, or data about it. The provided text focuses on population, not populism: it compiles demographic statistics (age structure, migration, fertility, mortality), labor-force and urbanization data, social housing trends, and historical censuses for Germany, Prussia, Vienna, and North Rhine-Westphalia. While there are occasional election-related aggregates (eligible voters, turnout, vote shares), these are not tied to populist parties, rhetoric, or attitudes, so they are at best ancillary inputs for a separate study on populist voting rather than direct evidence. An edge case is algorithmic confusion between “populism” and “population” or using these demographic series as covariates in models of populist support; without explicit linkage to populism, the match remains weak. Therefore, this document is non-relevant to “populism” despite being rich in population statistics.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A search for "populism" seeks a clear, concise explanation of the concept—its defining features, causes, and political forms—and how populist movements or leaders operate and affect democracy. The user may also want examples (historical and contemporary), typical rhetoric and policies, and how populism relates to issues like immigration, minority rights, and economic insecurity.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "populism" when it explicitly addresses populist ideas (people-versus-elite rhetoric, anti-establishment or charismatic leader claims, majoritarianism) or contains empirical measures that are commonly used to identify populist sentiment—for example, attitudes toward immigration, minority rights, economic grievance, or support for outsider parties. The paragraph’s many survey items about minority rights, estimates of immigrant proportions, poverty, and food-sufficiency concerns are potentially relevant because populist movements often mobilize around anti-immigrant sentiment and perceptions of economic threat. However, this text appears primarily to be a questionnaire/codebook (ISSP 2008 Norway) with repeated variable labels and metadata; that makes it only peripherally relevant unless the responses are analyzed to show links to populist voting or rhetoric. Purely technical content—variable codes, repeated prompts, sample-size notes, or population totals—is not itself evidence of populism and should be considered non-relevant unless tied to substantive analysis. To judge relevance in practice, prioritize documents that either analyze survey responses for populist attitudes or directly discuss populist actors, discourse, or mobilization.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking methodological resources and survey measures to study populism and related attitudes (e.g., political cynicism, satisfaction with the political system, nationalism/authoritarianism). They want guidance on sampling (probability vs non-probability), constructing derived variables in German datasets (ALLBUS/Microcensus), and applying Blossfeld’s occupational classification.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “populism” when it explicitly analyzes populist ideology, attitudes, parties, leaders, or outcomes—e.g., discussions of anti-elite rhetoric, people-centrism, Manichean “people vs. corrupt elites” frames, measurement of populist attitudes (such as Akkerman et al.’s scales), or voting for populist parties like AfD, Fidesz, or Podemos. It can also be relevant if constructs like political cynicism, nationalism, or attitudes toward out-groups (e.g., Islam) are directly linked to explaining or measuring populism. By contrast, material focused on general sampling theory, survey-mode guidance, occupational classifications, or generic psychometric scales (optimism, trust, locus of control, political system satisfaction) without tying them to populism is non-relevant. The provided paragraph mainly covers survey methodology and diverse attitude scales (e.g., SPS, KPZ, nationalism, attitudes to Islam) without framing them as measures or determinants of populism, so it is at best tangential. Edge cases include studies that never use the word “populism” but operationalize anti-elite sentiment or people-centrism as outcomes, which would be relevant, and methods papers that are only relevant if they are applied to sampling or measuring populist publics specifically.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks research-based insights on how employment status and workplace conditions influence health, including subjective and mental health. They likely want studies, reports, and policies on occupational health risks, sector- and gender-specific factors, and interventions to improve healthy work environments.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it analyzes the relationship between work and health—such as how employment status, working conditions, job control, shift work, or occupational safety influence physical, mental, or subjective health. Examples include studies comparing unemployed vs. employed people’s self-rated health, research linking low autonomy or monotonous industrial work to psychosomatic disorders, reports on caregivers’ burdens and health outcomes, or surveys like lidA and insurer reports tracking sickness absence in workplaces. Policy and organizational pieces are also relevant when they address workplace health management, gender in work and health, or climate-related heat risks at work, and dataset descriptions qualify if they include both work variables and health measures. Non-relevant items are those that discuss health without any tie to employment (e.g., medical history or genetic risk discourses) or talk about “Arbeit” as an academic thesis or generic “work” unrelated to employment or workplaces. Edge cases include documents focused mainly on education, social status, or environmental awareness; these are only relevant if they explicitly connect those topics to workers’ health or occupational conditions.</narr>

They likely want datasets, methodologies, and findings from studies such as ESENER and longitudinal surveys that assess how working conditions and unemployment affect health and well-being across sectors and countries.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly links health to work, such as discussing occupational safety and health management, psychosocial risks (work stress, harassment), risk assessments (Gefährdungsbeurteilung), workplace injuries or diseases (e.g., musculoskeletal disorders), sickness absence, or employer/employee measures to protect health at the workplace. For example, surveys of enterprises on how they manage Arbeitsschutz/Gesundheitsschutz, training of supervisors, return-to-work procedures, or analysis of health impacts of shift work and workload are highly relevant. Content that mentions “Gesundheit” only in a general or leisure context (sports, recreation, TV habits) without a workplace connection, or that discusses “Arbeit” only as employment status or job classification without health aspects, is non-relevant. Edge cases include studies on unemployment and health or work–family strain: these can be relevant if they analyze how employment conditions or job loss affect health, but less so if health is treated without a clear work linkage. Large multipurpose surveys are relevant only to the extent that their sections explicitly connect workplace conditions or policies to health outcomes.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The searcher wants information about how work affects health—whether job-related physical strains or occupational health problems limit activity at work or home, cause sick leave, and how people rate their overall health. They are likely looking for survey questions or measures (often referencing the past 12 months) that assess work-related health issues and concerns about specific risks like BSE or coronavirus.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "gesundheit arbeit" when it explicitly links health and work — for example, survey items or text asking whether a person is exposed at work to physical strains that could harm their health, whether a work-related health problem limits them at work or home, or how long they could not work because of an occupational health issue (phrases in the paragraph like "Sind Sie bei Ihrer Arbeit körperlichen Belastungen ausgesetzt..." or "Wie lange konnten Sie wegen Ihres arbeitsbedingten Gesundheitsproblems ... nicht arbeiten" are strong signals). It is non-relevant when "Gesundheit" and "Arbeit" appear only separately or as isolated metadata (e.g., repeated codes like I046, V692) or when the health topic (BSE, coronavirus, spoiled meat) is discussed purely as a general/public-health item with no workplace context. Edge cases include survey codebooks or repeated questionnaire batteries: these are relevant if you seek measurement of occupational health (they show the exact questions asked), but less useful if you are searching for clinical studies, workplace interventions, or epidemiological evidence. In short, prioritize documents that describe the work–health nexus (occupational exposures, work limitations, duration of work absence) and deprioritize materials that only incidentally mention health or work without connecting them.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking German research instruments and surveys related to work and health, including validated scales for work addiction, psychosocial safety climate, and organizational climate, along with measures of health behaviors. They want resources (e.g., from RKI, FReDA, GIP, STEP) detailing questionnaire items, pretests, and validation for assessing employee mental/physical health, work conditions, and preventive behaviors.</desc>
	<narr>A document is most relevant if it explicitly links health (Gesundheit) with work (Arbeit), especially in occupational or organizational contexts, such as employee mental health, working conditions, or workplace climate. Clear matches include instruments and studies on work addiction, Psychosocial Safety Climate (protecting employees’ psychological health), the BOKX relating workplace meaningfulness/competence to well-being, and STEP items on last-job conditions and health in older workers. It can be partially relevant if it covers health and work adjacent topics without a direct workplace link—for example, a reforms survey that jointly addresses labor market and health policy, or skin cancer screening when tied to occupational exposure. Documents are not relevant if they discuss health without a work nexus (e.g., children’s physical activity, active transport without commuting-to-work framing, satisfaction with a doctor visit, or LoneCovid social networks) or work without health (e.g., job values or procrastination scales unless explicitly occupational-health related). Edge cases include terms where “Gesundheit” appears only as an institution’s name or “Arbeit” is generic (e.g., “Arbeitsorientierung”) without health implications—these should be treated as non-relevant unless the content clearly connects work and health.</narr>

<title>geschlechterrolle</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The query seeks scholarly research on gender roles and attitudes—their determinants, cross-national differences, and changes over time—especially how gender, religion, socioeconomic context, and policy shape family and work divisions. It emphasizes empirical studies using large surveys (e.g., ALLBUS, ISSP, EUREQUAL, FReDA) in Germany, Eastern Europe, and other contexts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively examines gender roles (Geschlechterrolle/Geschlechterrollen/Geschlechtsrollen/Rollenbilder) as social expectations or norms, including attitudes toward them, their determinants, and their evolution in family, labor, education, or public life. Empirical studies using survey data (e.g., ALLBUS, ISSP, EUREQUAL, FReDA) on topics like the division of housework, views on maternal employment, East–West differences in Germany, post-communist trends, or campus negotiations of masculinity/femininity count as strongly relevant. Theoretical or feminist-psychology works that define concepts (such as gender code vs. role), analyze stereotypes, and link gender roles to outcomes like leadership, wellbeing, or policy are also relevant. Edge cases include historical or cultural analyses (e.g., motherhood debates, militarization in Serbia, or antisemitism framed through differing gender-role projections) that are relevant when gender roles are a central analytic lens but less so if the term appears only in passing. Non-relevant items are those that use “role” in non-gender senses, focus solely on grammatical gender or biological sex without social role expectations, or discuss gender equality broadly without analyzing role norms or the gendered division of labor.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking information and datasets on gender roles—attitudes, norms, division of labor, and equality—and how these have changed over time. They likely want survey-based measures from German population studies (e.g., ALLBUS) and ISSP modules on family and gender roles.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “geschlechterrolle” if it discusses norms, attitudes, or behaviors related to gender roles, such as family and gender roles modules (e.g., ISSP “Familie und Geschlechterrollen”), division of housework, women’s employment, equality, or perceptions of men’s and women’s roles in institutions like the military. Survey descriptions that explicitly list “Geschlechterrollen,” “Rollenverteilung zwischen Männern und Frauen,” or “sich verändernde Geschlechterrollen,” and include items on value orientations, tolerance, or policy attitudes tied to gender roles are highly relevant. Mentions that only list “Geschlechterrollen” among many topics (as in ALLBUS overviews) are still relevant, but weaker if they contain no detail beyond the label. Non-relevant would be texts that use “Rolle” or “Geschlecht” in unrelated senses (e.g., grammatical gender, biological sex variables without role norms) or that focus solely on survey methodology without any gender-role content. Edge cases include documents centered on “Gleichstellung” or “Rolle der Frau” that imply gender-role norms (likely relevant), and time-trend or cross-national comparisons of attitudes toward gender roles (relevant even if brief).</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for information about "Geschlechterrolle" (gender roles)—a concise explanation of the social norms and expectations that assign behaviors and responsibilities to men and women, particularly within families. They may also be seeking the ISSP 2012 international survey on family and gender roles, including the questionnaire and instructions for completing it.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "geschlechterrolle" if it explicitly discusses gender roles, norms, expectations, or attitudes — for example survey items, analyses, or questions about "Familie und Geschlechterrollen" and how people view men’s and women’s responsibilities. The provided paragraph is highly relevant because it is a questionnaire instruction for an international social survey asking respondents about family and gender roles. Non-relevant material would be administrative boilerplate, repeated UI instructions, duplicates of the same form text, or cases where the word appears only in metadata or as a different meaning (e.g., a theatrical "role"). Edge cases include texts that use synonyms or translations (such as "gender norms," "gender division of labor," or English-language questionnaires) — these should be considered relevant even if the exact German term is absent — while documents that mention "role" in unrelated domains (legal roles, medical roles) are false positives.</narr>

They want details on how neighborhood social openness, control, and discrimination are measured and linked to egalitarian gender role attitudes in German panel studies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively discusses gender roles (Geschlechterrollen), gender norms, or gender equality, including research or surveys that measure attitudes toward traditional vs. egalitarian roles in family, work, or society. Examples include ISSP modules on “Family and Gender Roles,” questionnaires about gender justice, division of household labor and caregiving, or studies on how neighborhood openness and social control influence egalitarian gender attitudes. Methodological descriptions (e.g., cognitive interviews, web probing) are relevant when they explicitly test items about gender roles; if they only describe methods without gender-content, relevance is limited. A document is non-relevant if “Rolle” refers to unrelated meanings (theater roles, mechanical rollers) or if it focuses on social openness/control or discrimination without linking these to gender roles. Edge cases include work on pluralism, integration, or attitudes toward outgroups that is relevant only when it connects those themes to gender equality or gender role attitudes; synonyms like Rollenbilder, Gendernormen, or gender roles in English also qualify.</narr>

They want studies on determinants such as gender, socioeconomic context, region, religion, and socialization, and their implications for family/work division of labor, using survey datasets (e.g., EUREQUAL, ALLBUS, ISSP, FReDA).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it primarily analyzes, defines, measures, or debates Geschlechterrollen (gender roles), such as norms and expectations around family and paid work, gendered division of labor, or attitudes toward women’s and men’s roles. Strong examples include empirical studies using surveys like ALLBUS, ISSP, FReDA, or EUREQUAL to examine determinants and trends in gender-role attitudes (e.g., working motherhood in East vs. West Germany, post-communist Eastern Europe), as well as research on socialization, stereotypes, or policy impacts on role expectations. Theoretical or historical works from feminist perspectives and context-specific case studies (e.g., universities in Tanzania, Serbia’s post-socialist shifts) are relevant when they explicitly link behaviors, conflicts, or institutions to gender-role norms. Non-relevant items are those that only mention the term in passing, focus strictly on biological sex differences or cognitive traits without connecting them to social roles, or use “Rolle” metaphorically (e.g., theatrical roles). Edge cases include multi-topic studies (e.g., religion, work ethic, mobility/time use) where gender roles are just one dimension; these are relevant only if they directly analyze how role expectations shape the observed outcomes.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks survey-based information on gender roles—attitudes, norms, and their change over time—particularly in Germany. They are likely interested in datasets and findings from programs like ALLBUS and ISSP modules on family and gender roles.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly discusses gender roles in society (Geschlechterrollen), such as attitudes toward the roles of men and women, division of housework, women’s employment, equality, or how these norms change over time. Strong examples include survey descriptions or findings (e.g., ALLBUS or ISSP modules) that measure views on family and gender roles, questions about women in the labor market or military, or cross-national/trend analyses of gender role attitudes. Content is also relevant if it provides datasets, questionnaires, or detailed indicators specifically targeting gender roles. Non-relevant material would be pieces that only mention the term in a generic topic list without substantive detail, or texts focused on other themes (e.g., security policy) unless they explicitly examine gender roles within that context (such as opinions on women soldiers). Edge cases include German synonyms and related phrases (Rollenbilder, Rolle von Mann und Frau, Gleichstellung), duplicate or metadata-only records with no discussion, and works about grammatical gender or gender identity that lack a link to social role expectations.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The searcher wants a clear definition and overview of "gender roles" — the social norms and expected behaviors for men and women in family and society. They may also be looking for public opinion and research findings or cross‑country survey results (for example the ISSP 2012 questionnaire on family and gender roles).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "geschlechterrollen" if it directly addresses gender roles—e.g., survey questions, empirical results, theoretical discussions, or policy analyses about expectations for men and women. The provided paragraph is partially relevant because it explicitly names "Familie und Geschlechterrollen" and describes an international questionnaire on that topic, but its content is largely administrative (instructions for filling in the questionnaire) rather than substantive findings or analysis. Documents that are non-relevant include boilerplate UI text, consent forms, navigation help, or repeated duplicates that mention the phrase only as a label without discussing attitudes, measures, or results. Edge cases include texts that use the word in a different sense (historical usage, book title, or index entry), materials about related topics like "family" or "gender equality" that do not deal with roles per se, and poor OCR/translations where the term appears erroneously; these may be borderline and require checking context to decide relevance.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “geschlechterrollen” if it directly discusses gender roles, gender equality, or attitudes toward the division of roles in family, work, or society, including survey-based measurements of such views. The provided paragraph is relevant because it explicitly references the ISSP module “Familie und Geschlechterrollen,” tests items on gender equality and egalitarian attitudes, and examines how neighborhood social openness and control shape views on gender roles. Methodological content (cognitive interviews, web probing) remains relevant when it is used to develop or validate questions about gender roles; if it only describes survey logistics without substantive connection to gender-role content, relevance is weak. Documents focused on social openness, control, or discrimination that never tie these to gender roles, or that use “Rollen” in unrelated senses (e.g., theater roles, industrial rollers) or “Geschlecht” as purely biological/grammatical categories, are non-relevant. Edge cases include studies on immigrant integration or neighborhood dynamics that mention gender equality only tangentially (partial relevance) versus research on family policy, household labor division, or stereotypes explicitly framed as gender roles (clearly relevant).</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it defines, analyzes, compares, or empirically investigates Führungsstil (leadership style), whether in universities, public administration, classrooms, politics, or business. Clear examples include studies on gendered leadership styles in academia or social work, research linking teachers’ leadership styles to classroom interaction and learning, or biographies that explicitly examine a politician’s style (e.g., Angela Merkel’s moderating approach or Ernst Albrecht’s leadership). Also relevant are diagnoses of leadership deficits and modernization strategies that hinge on leadership style, or public-sector and entrepreneurship studies where supervisors’ Führungsstil affects participation, job security, or performance. A document is non-relevant if it uses the term only in passing as a label without substantive discussion, or focuses on unrelated history or careers without analyzing leadership behavior; borderline cases that use near-synonyms like Führungsverhalten, Leitungsstil/Leitungsaufgaben, or Klassenführung remain relevant if they connect to style constructs. Critiques that question the notion of a distinct “female leadership style” are still pertinent because they directly engage the concept, whereas texts about discrimination or career paths that never address how leadership is enacted are less relevant.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks research and survey evidence on leadership styles in organizations, examining supervisors’ behaviors, values, and management concepts/training. They want how leadership relates to employee motivation, communication, and workplace climate, with perceived vs. desired goals and analyses across corporate and military contexts, controlled for organizational and demographic factors.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it discusses leadership style directly—definitions, typologies (e.g., authoritarian vs. participative), measurements or scales, or evaluations of a supervisor’s or organization’s leadership approach. Examples include surveys that assess “Beurteilung des Führungsstils des unmittelbaren Vorgesetzten,” preferred own Führungsstil, leadership behavior in companies, or the Führungsstil in the Bundeswehr, as well as related factors like leadership training, written leadership principles, centralization of decisions, team work, control span, and manager–employee relations. It can also be relevant when leadership style is analyzed as a criterion in hiring or motivation, or appears in attitudes (e.g., acceptance of an authoritarian leadership style). Non-relevant would be material focused solely on wages, technical production, or consumption behavior without an explicit link to leadership style. Edge cases include synonyms such as Managementstil, Führungsverhalten, or Leitungsstil (relevant), and brief, incidental mentions without substantive content (only marginally relevant).</narr>

They may also be seeking practical guidance on how to identify, compare, or develop an effective leadership style for a given context.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "führungsstil" when it directly discusses leadership styles—definitions, typologies (e.g., authoritarian, democratic, laissez-faire, transformational), measurement tools, effects on team performance, or case studies in management contexts. For example, a German study comparing transformational and transactional Führungsstil in Mittelstand firms or a training manual describing how to adopt a participative Führungsstil would be highly relevant. Documents are non-relevant if they only mention the word in passing, use it as a metadata tag with no substantive content, or cover unrelated topics that happen to contain similar text (e.g., "Führerschein" or stylistic design guides). Edge cases include domain-specific treatments (military, nursing, software teams) that are relevant but narrow in scope, translations or documents in English that use "leadership style" instead of the German word, and OCR/typo variants like "fuhrungsstil"—these may be relevant but require normalization or user-intent clarification. Lastly, opportunistic content such as marketing blurbs or personality-quiz pages that superficially reference Führungsstil may be less useful for research despite matching the keyword.</narr>

The LMX captures relationship quality (trust, respect, encouragement, affection) via two main dimensions (supervisor promotion of employee self‑worth and satisfactory employee performance) and subscales for affection, loyalty, professional respect and perceived engagement, using everyday item wording.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "führungsstil" if it discusses leader–follower interaction patterns and measurement of leadership behavior, for example by describing the Leader–Member Exchange (LMX) scale, its dyadic focus, subscales (affection, loyalty, professional respect, perceived commitment), and core aspects such as trust, respect, encouragement and employee-rated items. Concrete signals of relevance are mention of Graen and Uhl-Bien (1995), the transactional leadership basis, that the questionnaire is completed by employees, or practical examples of how LMX captures differences in supervisory support and performance expectations. A document is non-relevant if it only uses the word "Führungsstil" in passing, treats leadership solely as administrative procedure, or focuses exclusively on unrelated topics (e.g., corporate policy or IT systems) without addressing interpersonal leadership patterns. Edge cases include psychometric validation papers (partially relevant if they discuss conceptual implications for leadership style, less so if they only report factor analyses) and translations or language-only descriptions that omit substantive links to leadership behavior.</narr>

It emphasizes critical refugee studies and empirical evidence on attitudes, aid, networks, and the lived experiences of specific groups such as women, LGBTQ+, and environmental refugees.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it centers on people with or claiming refugee status, their protection and rights, the institutions and laws that govern asylum, or their lived experiences of displacement, settlement, and integration. Studies of host–refugee relations in camps (e.g., Kakuma), UNHCR registration practices in Thailand/Malaysia, host-society attitudes in Lebanon or Germany, policy assessments (such as Uganda’s self-reliance model or France’s pandemic-era asylum adjustments), and group-specific analyses (Kurds, Oromo, Tamil, women, LGBTQ refugees) are clearly relevant. Pieces that theorize or represent refugee experience—Critical Refugee Studies, analyses of refugee photography, or work on militarized refugees and conflict diffusion—also qualify when refugees remain the primary focus; debates on “environmental refugees” are relevant despite legal contestation. Non-relevant items use “refugee” only metaphorically, mention it in passing, or discuss migration, labor markets, or border control in general without substantive refugee-specific content or distinctions. Edge cases include asylum seekers and IDPs (relevant when compared or linked to refugee frameworks), and methodological or conceptual critiques that depart from the 1951 Convention but still engage directly with refugee categories, rights, or experiences.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses refugees or asylum seekers—e.g., the situation of refugees in Germany or Europe, public attitudes toward them, impacts on crime or labor markets, integration progress, local reception, or evaluations of government refugee policy. Highly relevant examples include survey waves since 2016 on concerns about the influx, short- and long-term forecasts of advantages/disadvantages, Kantar’s 2021 polls on refugee policy, studies of local social cohesion that measure volunteer support and experiences with refugees, and accounts of personal engagement with refugees. Historical materials about GDR refugees or even colonial-era “refugees” identified via runaway advertisements can be relevant if the intent is broadly about people fleeing, but they are only marginally relevant if the focus is contemporary German refugee policy. Non-relevant content includes documents that merely list demographics, weights, IDs, or general political topics (e.g., digitization or climate) without substantive refugee-related measures, or texts that mention “refugee” only in passing or as metadata. Edge cases include duplicated survey waves, Berlin Cold War attitude studies, or datasets centered on traits like body height; these should be included only if they inform analyses of displacement or refugee experiences, and excluded when the query seeks current policy or integration outcomes in Germany.</narr>

	<desc>A set of survey questions measuring public attitudes toward refugees in Germany — asking whether refugees will bring more opportunities, more risks, or neither for the welfare state, economy, security, and social cohesion. It also asks whether politically repressed refugees should be allowed to stay and whether the EU should provide financial help to neighbouring countries to address internal conflicts.</desc>
	<narr>This document is relevant because it explicitly asks survey questions about refugees — e.g., whether recent arrivals to Germany will create opportunities or risks for the welfare state, economy, security, and social cohesion — and also asks about political repression, asylum, and EU financial assistance for neighbours, all central refugee policy topics. It is less relevant if a text only uses the word “refugee” in passing or discusses unrelated migration issues (e.g., labor migrants or historical refugee events) without addressing attitudes, policy, or impacts. Relevance increases when the document contains substantive questions or labels (mp16, mp17, mp18, V52, QC6) that map to welfare/economy/security/social-cohesion and asylum policy; purely duplicated or malformed questionnaire text still counts if those core items are present. An edge case is a document that contains the survey stubs or metadata but no plain-language questions — these may be borderline relevant because the intent is clear but the content may be unusable for analysis. Conversely, documents focused on administrative codes or unrelated “refuge” usages (e.g., software, shelters for animals) should be considered non-relevant.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking research on how to measure refugees’ social integration and well-being. They want validated multilingual tools (German, Arabic, Dari) for assessing sense of belonging, everyday discrimination, and health (SF-12), with evidence of reliability and measurement invariance in refugee samples in Germany.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “refugee” when refugees are the focal population or analytical lens—e.g., studies validating a Challenged Sense of Belonging Scale on thousands of adult refugees in Germany or adapting discrimination and health surveys (EDS, SF-12) for Arabic, Farsi/Dari, and German-speaking refugees. Methodological papers are still relevant if the instruments are developed, adapted, or tested specifically in refugee samples, or if they address refugee integration, belonging, discrimination, or health outcomes. By contrast, work on general immigrants or the “German-speaking population” without a clearly identified refugee subsample, or psychometric validations that never engage refugee status, would be non-relevant. Edge cases include studies on people with a “migration background” that mix migrants and refugees (partially relevant), papers focusing on closely related groups like asylum seekers or displaced persons (often relevant), and documents that only mention refugees in passing without empirical or conceptual focus (likely non-relevant).</narr>

Emphasis on cultural and organizational determinants, work–family balance, and comparative findings across age groups, regions, and countries.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly examines Führungskräfte (managers/executives) as a distinct group—their roles, conditions, competencies, behaviors, or outcomes—such as studies on part‑time feasibility and rates among executives, health and workload patterns of supervisors versus non-leaders, gender bias toward female managers, recruitment and retention of Fach- und Führungskräfte, or age differences in learning strategies. Empirical analyses using datasets (e.g., ALLBUS, PIAAC), organizational case studies, or models that explain determinants of leadership practice (e.g., culture, job demands-resources) are strong signals of relevance, including work on measurement instruments validated with German Führungskräfte. Documents are non-relevant when “Führungskräfte” is only mentioned in passing while the focus is the general workforce, when leadership is discussed purely abstractly without anchoring to people in managerial positions, or when the topic concerns unrelated “Führungs-” terms (e.g., certificates) or entirely different domains. Edge cases include mixed-sample studies: they are relevant if they report separate results for managers or derive manager-specific implications, and sector-specific leadership (universities, public administration, education) also counts if it centers on those leaders. Research about managers’ family/partner dynamics can be relevant when it analyzes work–family interfaces for Führungskräfte, but becomes less relevant if it focuses primarily on partners without managerial insights.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>Find empirical studies and datasets about executives/managers (Führungskräfte), mainly in Germany (with some European coverage), examining training and career development, selection and HR policies, roles and hierarchies, work practices and ICT use, compensation, leadership behavior and attitudes, public-sector reform, and related demographics.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it centers on executives/managers (Führungskräfte) as subjects—covering their roles, hierarchy, selection and evaluation practices, compensation and benefits, training/continuing education, workload and time allocation, leadership styles, or attitudes (e.g., surveys of German managers on ICT use, career paths, or public-sector executive reform perceptions). Employer-side descriptions of leadership structures and pipelines, criteria for executive hiring, and programs for Führungskräfteweiterbildung also qualify, as do studies explicitly targeting leitende Angestellte or “Manager” as respondents. A document is non-relevant if it only mentions the term in passing or in a different domain, such as election studies about “strong leaders” in politics, general workplace safety surveys focused on employees rather than managers, or profiles of other professions (e.g., safety engineers) where executives are not the primary focus. Edge cases include compound terms and synonyms (Leitende Angestellte, Manager, Führungskräftenachwuchs), and pieces where executives are either the topic or the surveyed population—both can be relevant if executives are central rather than incidental. Borderline items like functional role requirement analyses or firm “Führungsstruktur” descriptions are relevant, whereas social media datasets about party leaders’ campaign messaging are not unless they explicitly address organizational executives.</narr>

	<desc>The user is looking for the meaning and context of the German term "Führungskräfte" and for a concise summary of repeated survey question wording asking whether the "right people" occupy leading positions in German politics and business. They likely want the historical wording variations (1977–2017) and a clear translation or explanation of that survey question.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "Führungskräfte" if it explicitly discusses people in leadership or executive roles—e.g., corporate executives, political leaders, managers, or survey questions asking whether the “right people” occupy leading positions. Good examples include news articles about executive appointments, academic studies of managerial behavior, or public-opinion polls asking about “Leute in führender Stellung” or “Führungspositionen.” Documents are not relevant if they only use similar words in a different sense (for instance “führend” meaning “leading” in a descriptive way, or “Führerschein” which is unrelated), or if the term appears only once in passing without substantive discussion. Edge cases include texts about team captains or sports coaches (potentially relevant depending on user intent), historical questionnaire wording that repeats the phrase verbatim (relevant for tracking phrasing changes), and language/orthography variants (Führungskraft, Führungsposition, lowercase/uppercase, hyphenation) that should be treated as matches. In ranking, favor documents where the term appears in headings, abstracts, metadata, or in concentrated discussion about leadership roles rather than incidental mentions.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly focuses on Führungskräfte (leaders/executives) and their behavior, communication, relationships with employees, or training/evaluation, especially in German contexts. Clear signals include discussion of leadership communication from employees’ perspective, Leader–Member Exchange (e.g., LMX/LMX7 with facets like Affection, Loyalty, Professional Respect, Perceived Contribution), the SymCom Check for symmetric internal communication, or evaluation tools for leadership training in emergency services (FIRE PL/E/G/DO/EV/ST/CU) with psychometric evidence. It is also relevant if it reports validation details (factor structure, internal consistency, construct/criterion validity) of scales used to assess leadership or leader training outcomes. Non-relevant items include uses of “Führung” or “Kräfte” in unrelated meanings (e.g., steering, physical forces), generic firefighter training without a leadership focus, or workplace communication content that omits leaders. Edge cases: singular Führungskraft, synonyms like Vorgesetzte/r, Leitung, or Management count; English-only leadership constructs can be relevant if they pertain to leader–employee dynamics, whereas purely peer-to-peer communication or rescue exercises without leader evaluation would not.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks a synthesized overview of refugee studies, including critical theory and legal frameworks, host-country policies and attitudes, protection challenges and abuses, and mechanisms of identification and aid. They want comparative, evidence-based insights on integration and social cohesion across contexts and groups (e.g., women, LGBTQ, environmental refugees) with case studies from Europe, Africa, and Asia.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it centers refugees as the main subject—law, policy, protection, lived experience, or specific communities—and treats the topic with substantive analysis or evidence. Examples include studies of host–refugee relations in Kakuma camp, UNHCR registration practices in Thailand/Malaysia, attitudes toward refugees in Germany or Lebanon, accounts of refoulement and forced recruitment in West Africa, or integration and labor-market outcomes in Germany, Greece, Uganda, France, and the Netherlands; theoretical work in Critical Refugee Studies and focused topics on refugee women or LGBTQ refugees are also clearly relevant. Non-relevant items would only mention refugees in passing, conflate them entirely with general migration without distinguishing legal status, use “refuge” metaphorically, or discuss unrelated humanitarian issues without a refugee focus. Edge cases include work on asylum seekers, IDPs, or “environmental refugees,” and visual/representational studies; these are relevant when they explicitly connect findings to refugee status, rights, governance, or lived experiences, but less so when the link is tenuous.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking surveys and studies on refugees—primarily in Germany and Europe—that capture public attitudes, personal experiences and volunteering, evaluations of government asylum/integration policy, perceived societal impacts, and detailed demographics across multiple waves. The corpus may also include specialized datasets such as on GDR refugees and historical runaway advertisements with individual descriptors.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses refugees—e.g., public attitudes toward refugees and asylum policy, integration progress, local experiences with refugees/asylum seekers, impacts on crime or labor markets, or surveys and polls about the refugee situation in Germany or Europe. Materials that center on volunteer engagement with refugees, government performance in managing the refugee crisis, or historical analyses that explicitly describe refugees (including GDR refugees or ads describing refugees/runaways) are also relevant. Items that only mention refugees in passing, list methodological metadata (IDs, weights, dates) without refugee-focused questions, or discuss broad politics (taxes, digitization) without a clear refugee section are non-relevant. Edge cases include studies about “migrants” or “asylum seekers”: they are relevant if refugee-specific findings can be isolated; and colonial-era “runaways” or deserters are relevant only if framed as refugees fleeing and analyzed as such. For example, repeated survey waves tracking concerns about refugee influx and integration are relevant, while a dataset limited to respondents’ demographics with no refugee questions is not.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A request for survey-style public attitudes about refugees in Germany: whether recent arrivals will create more opportunities, more risks, or neither for the welfare state, economy, security, and social cohesion over the next few years. Also seeks opinions on whether refugees who suffered political repression should be allowed to stay and whether the EU should fund efforts to help neighboring countries deal with internal conflicts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses refugees and the specific topics in the query—questions or analysis about whether refugees create opportunities or risks for the welfare state, economy, security, and social cohesion, plus items on admitting people who suffered political repression and on EU financial help for neighbouring conflicts (for example, survey questionnaires, opinion polls, policy briefs or statistical reports covering those items). It is non-relevant if it only uses the word “refugee” in passing, discusses unrelated migration topics (e.g., general labor migration) without linking to asylum or the listed domains, or contains only metadata/variable codes or noise with no substantive items. Edge cases include documents about “migrants” or “internally displaced persons,” which may be partially relevant if they explicitly treat asylum status or the four domains, and historical or fictional mentions of refugees, which are usually not relevant to contemporary survey/policy questions. Repeated or duplicated question text (as in the paragraph) still counts as relevant because it contains the core survey items, though duplicates add no new information. Practical relevance signals are the presence of the keywords welfare/economy/security/social cohesion, references to political repression or EU neighbor aid, and a question/response format indicating a survey or public-opinion context.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking research on measuring refugees’ social integration and wellbeing, focusing on validated multilingual (German/Arabic/Dari) instruments—such as a Challenged Sense of Belonging Scale, the Everyday Discrimination Scale, and the SF-12—with evidence of reliability, validity, and measurement invariance in refugee samples in Germany.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “refugees” when it centers on refugee populations, their experiences, measurement tools validated in refugee samples, or policies/services affecting them. This paragraph is clearly relevant: it describes scales for sense of belonging, discrimination, and health (SF-12) that were adapted, pretested, and validated specifically with large multilingual samples of adult refugees in Germany (e.g., English, Arabic, Farsi/Dari speakers), and reports psychometric results like CFA and measurement invariance for those groups. Content that only discusses social integration or health in the general population without explicitly including refugees, or that mentions “refugees” only in passing or as a metaphor, would be non-relevant. Edge cases include studies on “individuals with a migration background” or Arabic/Dari speakers where refugees are part of a mixed sample; these can still be relevant if refugees are a defined subgroup or the tools are intended for refugee assessment, but less so if refugees cannot be distinguished from other migrants.</narr>

<title>führungskraft</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an overview of the role of a Führungskraft (manager/leader). They want research-based insights on competencies, part-time feasibility, health and workload, gender dynamics and stereotypes, training/learning, recruitment, and work–life balance, especially in Germany and in international comparison.</desc>
	<narr>For the query “führungskraft,” a document is relevant if it focuses on people in leadership or managerial roles in organizations and explicitly uses the term or close German synonyms. Highly relevant examples include studies on part-time work among Führungskräfte, analyses of their health and work demands, research on gender biases toward female Führungskräfte, discussions of leadership competencies and training, or tools for leadership categorization. Documents are non-relevant when “Führung” is used in other senses (e.g., guided tours, Führungszeugnis, Führungsschiene) or when “Kraft” refers to strength/energy, or when Führungskräfte are only mentioned in passing within a general workforce piece. Edge cases that should still count as relevant include texts using synonyms like leitende Angestellte, Vorgesetzte, Manager, Top-Management, or sector-specific leaders (e.g., pädagogische Führungskräfte), as well as spelling variants like Fuehrungskraft and the plural Führungskräfte. Conversely, very abstract leadership essays that never address the roles, conditions, or competencies of managers in practice may be marginal for a keyword targeting the German term.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking research and survey data on managers/executives (Führungskräfte), covering their development and training, hierarchical roles and selection, work practices and workload, compensation and career paths, and attitudes—primarily in German industry and the European public sector.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses Führungskräfte (executives/managers) as actors—their roles, hierarchy, selection and evaluation, training and development, workloads, compensation, or attitudes—for example surveys like “Manager und Computer,” “Gehalt und Position von Führungskräften,” COCOPS on public-sector executives, or descriptions of firms’ leadership structures and Führungskräfteweiterbildung. Content that analyzes organizational requirements for leadership posts, HR policies for executive selection, or executive education (e.g., Führungskräftepolitik, Führungskräfteweiterbildung) across sectors, including public administration or industry, is clearly in scope. Partially relevant are texts where Führungskraft appears only tangentially, such as workplace safety studies that merely note “Schulung von Führungskräften” or include a demographic flag “Führungskraft mit Personalverantwortung,” or studies about safety engineers that reference expectations of company leadership without focusing on them. Non-relevant are documents using the term in a purely political-normative sense (e.g., voter surveys about preference for a “starke Führungskraft” vs. democracy) or that discuss generic “Führung” or unrelated “Kraft” without referring to managerial personnel. Edge cases include morphological and spelling variants (Führungskraft/Führungskräfte/Fuehrungskraft, compounds like Führungskräftepolitik), synonyms such as leitende Angestellte or Manager that still target the same group, and metadata-only mentions where the main text is not about executives.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for information about survey questions and public‑opinion results on whether the “right people” hold leadership positions (Führungskräfte) in German politics and business. They want clarification of the question wording used in different years (1977–2017) and the resulting trends or responses.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "führungskraft" if it explicitly discusses managers or leaders (Führungskraft/Führungskräfte) — for example job ads seeking a Führungskraft, profiles of executives, academic studies of leadership, or survey questions asking whether the right people occupy leading positions in politics or business. Text that repeatedly contains the exact German survey wording you supplied (e.g., “Glauben Sie … die richtigen Leute in den führenden Positionen sind”) is highly relevant because it directly addresses perceptions of leadership. Documents are non‑relevant when the string appears only incidentally or as noise (OCR duplicates, codes like “V106”, or boilerplate repetition), when related words are used in different senses (e.g., Führung as tour guiding, or führend meaning “leading” in a descriptive rather than a role sense), or when the term appears only in metadata or an index without substantive content. Edge cases include translations or multilingual documents where the English term “manager/leader” is used instead of the German, and questionnaire archives that repeat the question across years — these can be partly relevant but may require checking adjacent sentences to confirm substantive discussion of leadership rather than mere structural repetition.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks German-language, validated tools to assess leadership and leader–member communication (e.g., LMX7, LMX-MDM, SymCom) and to evaluate training for rescue-service leaders (FIRE modules), including their subscales, factor structures, and psychometric validity.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it focuses on the role or behavior of a Führungskraft (manager/leader) in organizations, such as measuring leader–employee communication or relationships (e.g., LMX7/LMX-MDM, communication quality scales, SymCom for symmetric internal communication). Content evaluating or developing training for Führungskräfte, especially in the rescue services context (e.g., FIRE instruments for plan/einsatz exercises, group work, instructors, self-directed tasks, seminars, or the Führungsstab), is also clearly relevant. It can still be relevant even if “Führungskraft” appears in plural or via close synonyms (e.g., Vorgesetzte, Führungsperson) or if the leader–member concept is referenced using English terms (Leader–Member Exchange). Non-relevant documents would discuss “Führung” in unrelated senses (guided tours, criminal records/Führungszeugnis) or general communication/training not tied to leaders or leadership roles; borderline cases include purely psychometric discussions with no explicit link to leadership contexts.</narr>

<title>führung</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking comprehensive information on “Führung” (leadership), including core theories, models, and empirical research, and how leadership operates across management, education, military (Innere Führung), and political contexts. Key interests include cooperative leadership, gender dynamics, organizational learning and change, and European case studies (EU, Germany, Russia).</desc>
	<narr>For the query “führung” (leadership/management), a document is relevant if it explicitly analyzes leadership as a concept, practice, or role—such as summaries of leadership theories and styles, studies of cooperative leadership in organizations or EU politics, research on the Bundeswehr’s Innere Führung, or examinations of leadership in arts contexts (e.g., orchestras) and in socio-digital transformation. Empirical work on gender and leadership, university rector leadership using the Full Range of Leadership model, Delphi studies on top executives, or organizational learning and leadership in schools and nonprofits also qualifies. Historical-political analyses that scrutinize how national or party leadership operates and shapes outcomes (e.g., Italian prime-ministerial leadership, Russian/Belarusian state leadership, leadership changes in post-DDR transitions) are relevant when they treat leadership as a causal or structural variable. Non-relevant would be items where “Führung” is only a passing mention (a tagline, list entry, or proverb), or where it means something else (a guided tour, a technical guide/rail) without substantive leadership content. Edge cases: fixed terms like Innere Führung are still relevant; studies of “führerlose Gruppen” are relevant if they analyze the absence of leadership as a leadership construct; brief newsy mentions of a leader without analysis are likely non-relevant.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking survey items and data related to “Führung,” including guided tours in art exhibitions (participation, expectations, satisfaction) and leadership in political and organizational contexts (coalition/government leadership and management practices). They want to locate where and how “Führung” is measured or discussed across the listed studies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “führung” if it explicitly addresses leadership or a guided tour, for example political leadership formulations like “unter Führung der SPD/SED,” organizational management such as “Personalmanagement und Führung,” or museum/arts contexts like “Teilnahme an einer Führung” and “Zufriedenheit mit der Führung.” Mentions of party- or government-led coalitions (“aus SPD und CDU unter Führung der SPD”), or leadership evaluations of politicians also qualify. It is typically non-relevant if it discusses politics or culture without touching leadership or tours, or if it only matches the string inside unrelated words. Important edge cases include German compounds and variants: “Führungen” (plural), “Fuehrung” (ue spelling), and compounds like “Führungskräfte,” “Führungsstil” are relevant, while substrings in “Durchführung,” “Einführung,” or “Aufführung” are false positives. Context that clearly signals the sense (leadership vs. guided tour) strengthens relevance, whereas vague or idiomatic uses without that meaning do not.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants to know what the German term "Führung" means in the context of survey questions and how it’s used (e.g., managerial vs. supervisory roles). They are also looking to interpret or summarize poll items about a statutory female quota in leadership of large companies and public preferences about which party or leader should head governments (e.g., Merkel, SPD, CDU, Linke).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "führung" when it substantively discusses leadership, management or supervisory roles — for example texts about corporate leadership ("in der Führung von größeren Unternehmen"), political leadership ("Regierung unter Führung der SPD/CDU") or occupational status ("als Führungs- oder Aufsichtskraft tätig"), and policy measures tied to leadership such as a "gesetzliche Frauenquote". Variants and compound forms matter: occurrences like "Führung", "Führungskraft", "unter Führung", "Führungs-" or hyphenated forms should all be counted as relevant, and surrounding words (e.g. Unternehmen, SPD, Frauenquote) help confirm the leadership sense. A document is non-relevant if the term appears only as formatting noise, repeated survey metadata, OCR errors, or in unrelated senses (e.g. tactical/sports phrasing like "in Führung liegen" or unrelated compounds) without substantive discussion of management or governance. Edge cases include negated or perfunctory survey questions (which mention "Führung" but add little content), translations where the term is rendered differently, and ambiguous contexts where surrounding terms must be used to decide true relevance.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is looking for information on leadership assessment, specifically the German Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) that measures transformational leadership, its origins in Bass & Avolio (1995), and its withdrawn status.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it uses “Führung” in the leadership/management sense, especially in organizational psychology contexts (e.g., transformational leadership) and may reference tools like the German Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) or scholars such as Bass and Avolio; for example, a German description of the MLQ’s development based on Bass & Avolio (1995), even noting that version as withdrawn, is highly relevant. It is non-relevant if “Führung” refers to unrelated meanings such as a guided tour (“Museumsführung”), mechanical guides/rails (“Führungsschiene”), or administrative terms like “Führungszeugnis.” Edge cases include compound forms and orthographic variants such as “Führungskraft,” “Führungsverhalten,” or “Fuehrung,” which should still count as relevant, whereas a page that only lists the term in a bibliography or navigation menu without substantive discussion is weakly relevant. Documents in English that discuss “leadership” without the German keyword may be conceptually relevant but may not match a strict keyword query, while retraction notices that analyze why an MLQ version was withdrawn can still be relevant due to their focus on leadership measurement.</narr>

<title>geschlecht und geschlechterrollen</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The query seeks scholarly information on gender and gender roles, focusing on their social construction, feminist critiques, socialization, stereotypes, and the gendered division of labor. It also looks for comparative and longitudinal analyses of attitudes and policies across contexts (e.g., Germany, Serbia, Japan, Eastern Europe) and their impact on work, family, and equality.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it examines gender as a social category and explicitly analyzes gender roles—how they are constructed, enacted, or changing—such as feminist critiques of psychology, studies of socialization of boys and girls, stereotypes, division of labor, or time-use patterns that differ by gender. Empirical work using surveys (e.g., ALLBUS, ISSP, EUREQUAL) or case studies (East/West Germany, Serbia’s post-socialist transition, Japan–Germany comparisons) that measure attitudes toward maternal employment, retraditionalization, or “doing/undoing gender” in everyday practices also fits well. Thematic lenses like media representation of women leaders, right-wing party gender ideologies, or intersections with antisemitism are relevant when they tie differences in content or behavior to gender roles and their reproduction or contestation. Non-relevant items would be pieces that only treat Geschlecht as a biological variable without discussing roles, generic equality statements with no analysis of role expectations, or tangential references where “gender” appears but role norms are not a focus; duplicate summaries add little additional value. Edge cases include works using variant terminology (Geschlechtsrollen), studies focused on a single subgroup or setting (e.g., cemeteries) that still analyze role performance, and theoretical pieces on technoscience and gender identities that connect to the loosening of rigid roles.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is looking for survey data and analyses on gender and gender roles in Germany—e.g., family roles, equality, and division of labor—particularly from ALLBUS and ISSP modules. They seek sources enabling trend and comparative analyses across years (and possibly countries).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly discusses gender and gender roles, such as attitudes toward women’s and men’s roles in family and work, division of housework, equality/egalitarianism, or women’s participation in institutions (e.g., the military or politics), and especially if it reports or analyzes data from modules like “Familie und Geschlechterrollen.” Survey descriptions that explicitly include “Geschlechterrollen” as a topic (e.g., ALLBUS or ISSP waves covering family and changing gender roles) are relevant, particularly when they detail indicators, questions, or findings on norms and role expectations. Documents that only mention “Geschlecht” as a demographic variable or list it among many controls without discussing roles or norms are not relevant, and pieces focused on other themes (religion, political participation, social capital) are non-relevant unless they contain a substantive subsection on gender roles. Edge cases include records that merely name “Geschlechterrollen” in a long topic list without any measures or results (borderline) versus those that replicate gender-role items as part of a broader survey (still relevant if the items are included). References to “gender” in a grammatical sense or to biological sex/health without social role content should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants a clear explanation of the difference between "sex" (biological characteristics) and "gender/gender roles" (socially constructed identities and expectations), plus guidance on how these concepts are labeled or measured in household survey data (e.g., variables like GESCHLECHT or "Welches Geschlecht haben Sie").</desc>
	<narr>The query "geschlecht und geschlechterrollen" asks for material about gender (sex) and the social roles or expectations attached to gender. A document is highly relevant if it contains substantive discussion, analysis, or examples of both sex/gender and gender roles — for example an article comparing how men’s and women’s work is valued, or a survey report analyzing role attitudes by gender. The paragraph you supplied mostly repeats the label "Geschlecht" and survey variable codes (V504, V297, etc.), which makes it marginally relevant as evidence that sex/gender was recorded, but not relevant for "geschlechterrollen" unless those variables or surrounding text actually analyze roles; a codebook or raw field list without interpretation is low-value for the query. Edge cases include instances where "Geschlecht" appears in different senses (biological sex vs social gender), documents that use synonyms like "gender" or "Rollen," and noisy repetitions or metadata that mention gender without any discussion of roles.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks studies and survey instruments on how gender and gender roles are conceptualized and measured—especially in German social research (e.g., ISSP modules, demographic standards, cognitive pretests). They also want findings on egalitarian gender-role attitudes and the validity or invariance of related scales across groups.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to “geschlecht und geschlechterrollen” if it directly discusses the concept and measurement of Geschlecht (e.g., male/female/diverse, biological vs legal vs identity) and examines attitudes, norms, or egalitarianism regarding Geschlechterrollen, such as the ISSP “Family and Gender Roles” module or studies linking neighborhood openness/control to gender‑role attitudes. Material that debates how to capture gender identity in surveys or presents the status quo of recording sex is relevant for the “Geschlecht” part, and becomes fully relevant when connected to role expectations or policy implications. By contrast, studies that merely use Geschlecht as a control variable or report measurement invariance across gender for unrelated constructs (gratitude scales, curiosity inventories, attractiveness ratings) are non‑relevant or only tangential. Methodological notes on survey modes or panel design without substantive analysis of gender or roles are non‑relevant. Edge cases include analyses of nonmarital unions or same‑ vs different‑sex pair classification, which are only relevant if they address role distributions, division of labor, or role norms within partnerships.</narr>

<title>gender role attitudes</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks comparative research on how individual and societal gender role attitudes—including their level, consistency, and polarization—shape fertility and childlessness, marital attitudes, and women’s labor supply across countries and over time. They also want to understand how policy contexts, modernization, and regional differences moderate these relationships.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly measures or analyzes gender role attitudes—e.g., traditional vs. egalitarian views—and how these attitudes vary across individuals, regions, or time, or how they relate to outcomes like fertility, labor supply, marriage, or childlessness. Studies that construct indices from surveys (ISSP, EVS, ALLBUS), compare East–West contexts, examine polarization or dispersion of attitudes, or test multilevel effects of individual attitudes and societal norms all directly match the query. Papers focusing only on gendered behaviors, policies, or labor-market outcomes without assessing attitudes, or that discuss gender identity or schema theory without linking to gender role attitudes, would be non-relevant. Edge cases include work on “social norms” that does not measure attitudes but is tightly tied to them (often still relevant), and single-country case studies or methodological pieces that focus on how to measure gender role attitudes (relevant if attitudes are central, less so if they only mention the term in passing).</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking survey-based information on public attitudes toward gender roles and gender equality, including views on women’s roles (e.g., in the military), division of household and childcare labor, and changing gender norms. They likely want comparative or longitudinal data, especially from German and European studies such as ALLBUS/ISSP and recent EU voter surveys.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly measures or analyzes beliefs about gender roles—e.g., scales of “gender role orientation,” opinions on the division of household and childcare tasks, support for women’s employment or breadwinner–homemaker norms, or attitudes toward women in the armed forces. Broad social surveys that include modules like “Family and Changing Gender Roles” (ALLBUS/ISSP) or a specific question on gender roles (EES 2024) are relevant even if gender roles are only one subsection. Data on time use or household task distribution can be relevant when linked to attitudinal items (preferences, fairness judgments), but purely behavioral logs without any opinion measures are borderline or non-relevant. Documents that only list “gender” as a demographic, or focus on political/security issues without questions about gender-role beliefs, are non-relevant. Mentions of “gender equality” or “gender roles” are relevant only if they capture respondents’ evaluations or approval (e.g., acceptance of women soldiers); institutional descriptions or policy overviews without public attitudes are not.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>Asking where people think gender stereotypes are most widespread—e.g., in schools, the workplace, media, advertising, sport, politics, or elsewhere—to gauge public attitudes about the prevalence and sources of gender role stereotypes. The aim is to measure perceptions of how and where preconceived ideas about men’s and women’s roles contribute to inequality.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "gender role attitudes" if it explicitly addresses beliefs about appropriate roles and behaviors for women and men, measures those beliefs (for example with survey questions), or analyzes how those attitudes vary by context or group. The paragraph contains the exact survey prompt "Preconceived ideas about the image and role of women and men... In your opinion where do you think gender stereotypes are most widespread" and lists response categories (schools, work, media, advertising, sport, politics, none, other, DK), which makes it directly relevant because it captures both the attitude being asked about and the contexts used to elicit responses. It also contains a lot of repeated metadata tokens and duplicative text (qb9, d10, v601 and repeated question lines); such noise reduces usefulness unless the document includes actual response data or analysis rather than only labels. Edge cases: a codebook that only supplies the question wording and response codes is partially relevant (useful for measurement) but less so than a dataset with responses or a paper interpreting those attitudes. Conversely, a text that merely mentions the word "gender" without discussing role expectations or attitudes would be non-relevant.</narr>

	<desc>The user wants information on how gender role attitudes are defined, measured, and tracked in surveys, including key dimensions (ideology, consequences, economic), related constructs (work–family conflict, ambivalent sexism), and commonly used instruments (e.g., ISSP). They may also seek evidence of changes over time and guidance on operationalizing sex/gender in survey research.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly examines gender role attitudes—normative beliefs about appropriate behavior for women and men—and describes how these attitudes are conceptualized or measured. Clear signals include discussions of established scales or dimensions (e.g., gender role ideology, consequence and economic consequence dimensions, ISSP Family and Changing Gender Roles items), work–family conflict framed by gender, or ambivalent sexism toward men (hostility/benevolence with components like paternalism, maternalism, gender differentiation, and heterosexuality). Methodological pieces can also be relevant when they address how sex/gender is recorded, distinguish sex from gender identity, or test measurement invariance that affects interpreting gender role attitudes. By contrast, content on unrelated constructs (need for cognition, patriotism/authority, welfare state attitudes, workplace mobbing, interviewer training, or general epistemology) is non-relevant unless it explicitly links those constructs to gender role attitudes. Edge cases include studies that merely control for gender or discuss “roles” (e.g., workplace role conflicts) without a gendered attitudinal focus—these are typically non-relevant—whereas cohort/age analyses are relevant only when they explain variation in gender role attitudes.</narr>

They also want evidence on how these beliefs affect outcomes like relationship satisfaction, fertility, and behavior, and implications for family therapy and gender equality policy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses gender roles as social norms, stereotypes, attitudes, or behaviors assigned to men and women, such as traditional vs. egalitarian beliefs, male breadwinner/female homemaker expectations, or role orientations (e.g., androgyny), and links them to outcomes like relationship satisfaction, fertility, education, or therapy. Studies that operationalize or measure gender role attitudes (indices, multidimensional scales), compare societies or time (ISSP, EVS, cross-national analyses), or propose frameworks like CAGRIC are highly relevant. Papers that discuss “the role of gender” only as a predictor (e.g., whether men and women differ in math scores) without engaging social role expectations, or focus purely on biological sex differences or general gender equality without a role-attitude dimension, are not relevant. Edge cases include content using synonyms like gender norms, household labor division, or sex-role identity (Bem) which are typically relevant; by contrast, mentions of “role models” or “role of gender” phrased generically can be false positives unless they analyze gender role expectations.</narr>

<research_data>
	<desc>The user wants sources and measures on gender roles and gender role orientation—covering division of household labor, childcare, time use, partnership and employment histories, and attitudes toward gender equality. They are specifically looking for survey datasets and modules (e.g., ALLBUS/GGSS and ISSP Family and Changing Gender Roles) to analyze these topics, primarily in Germany and in cross-national comparisons.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “gender role” if it examines gender role orientation, attitudes toward gender roles, or the division of labor in family and work, such as surveys on “family and changing gender roles,” “distribution of household tasks,” “time use,” “childcare,” or attitudes toward women in the armed forces. Descriptions of datasets or modules explicitly titled “Gender role orientation,” “Gender roles,” or “Family and Changing Gender Roles (ISSP/ALLBUS)” are strong matches, even if embedded in broader survey overviews. By contrast, content focused solely on security policy, NATO, electoral behavior, or the “role” of politicians or institutions without a gender dimension is non-relevant. Edge cases include documents that mention “gender” only as a demographic variable (not relevant), or use “role” in unrelated contexts (“role of NATO”), versus pieces that link partnership quality or employment biographies to gendered norms in household work (relevant).</narr>

This could be to inform a survey response, research, or policy/action planning about where gender-role biases are most prevalent.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "gender role" when it directly addresses expectations, stereotypes, or social functions associated with women and men — for example discussions of how gender roles operate in schools, workplaces, media, politics, sports, or advertising, or analyses of how those roles produce inequalities. Items that present survey questions or coded categories about where stereotypes occur (e.g., entries about schools, media, work, sports) are relevant if they include explanation, results, or interpretation rather than just labels. Conversely, material that only repeats the word "gender" or contains administrative codes (qb9, d10, v601) and duplicated filler text without substantive description is non‑relevant. Edge cases include documents that mention gender only as a demographic variable (e.g., in clinical data) — these are partially relevant only if they link that variable to role expectations or stereotype effects — and long lists of response labels or truncated survey prompts, which are relevant only when accompanied by analysis or respondent answers.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “gender role” when it defines or examines gender role orientations/ideology, normative expectations for men and women, changes in these attitudes over time, or presents instruments that measure gender role attitudes. Examples from the paragraph that are clearly relevant include the ISSP Family and Changing Gender Roles items (consequence, ideology, and economic dimensions), the discussion on recording sex vs. gender identity in surveys, and scales capturing ambivalent sexism toward men (paternalism/maternalism, gender differentiation, heterosexuality). Content is only partially relevant when “gender” appears merely as a demographic control or invariance check without engaging gender role norms (e.g., LWMS or curiosity/empathy scales reporting invariance by gender, AR1 controlling for evaluator gender). Non-relevant material includes general survey methodology (interviewer recruitment/training, open-ended question analysis) and unrelated psychometric scales (need for cognition, workplace mobbing, team performance, study satisfaction) unless explicitly tied to gender role ideologies. Edge cases include uses of “role” that are not about gender (e.g., workplace role conflicts or role-play evaluations); these remain non-relevant unless they explicitly analyze those conflicts through gendered expectations such as work–family interference framed by gender role ideology.</narr>

<title>gender roles</title>
<publication>
	<desc>Find research on gender role attitudes and norms—how they are measured and differ across societies—and their effects on interpersonal, family, and demographic outcomes (e.g., relationship satisfaction, fertility, academic behavior). Include multidimensional measurement approaches (beyond traditional–egalitarian scales) and implications for couple/family therapy and social policy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly examines gender roles as norms, attitudes, or expectations and their effects, such as studies using ISSP or EVS data to compare traditional versus egalitarian views, or frameworks like CAGRIC linking gender role beliefs and behaviors to relationship satisfaction. Papers that measure multidimensional role expectations (e.g., male breadwinner, female homemaker, female earner) or track determinants and change over time (education, religiosity, employment, policy regimes) are also relevant, including methodological work on cross-national measurement equivalence of gender role attitudes. Non-relevant items are pieces about gender equality or gender differences that never address role norms (e.g., performance gaps without linking to role attitudes) or texts that only mention “gender roles” in passing without analysis. Edge cases include research on gender role identity or sex-typed identities (relevant if tied to role beliefs/behaviors), non-English abstracts that centrally analyze gender roles, duplicated summaries, and domain-specific outcomes like academic procrastination or fertility when gender role orientations are explicit predictors. Overall, priority goes to empirical or theoretical treatments that classify, measure, or explain gender role norms and their social consequences, especially those moving beyond a single liberal–conservative scale.</narr>

<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks survey-based data on gender roles, including division of household work and childcare, employment and partnership histories, and attitudes toward gender equality. They likely want sources such as ALLBUS/GGSS and ISSP “Family and Changing Gender Roles” modules for trend and cross-national analysis.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly addresses gender roles—such as attitudes toward gender roles, gender role orientation, changing gender roles in families, division of household labor and childcare by gender, or evaluations of women’s roles in institutions (e.g., women in the armed forces). Clear signals include modules titled Family and Changing Gender Roles, measures of gender role orientation and self-perception, and survey content on time use, distribution of household tasks, partner history, and childcare analyzed through a gender lens. Documents are non-relevant when “role” refers to institutions or politicians (e.g., role of NATO, role of the opposition) or when “gender” appears only as a demographic control in studies focused on security, elections, or general politics. Mixed-topic surveys are relevant if a distinct module or item set explicitly covers gender roles, even if other modules focus on unrelated issues; items like quality of partnership or employment biography are only relevant if tied to gendered expectations or comparisons. Edge cases include broad “gender equality” mentions without role-specific measures, which may be weakly relevant unless they include explicit attitudes or behaviors about expected roles.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>A person searching "gender roles" is seeking a clear definition of gender roles/gender stereotypes and how these preconceived ideas about men and women contribute to inequalities. They likely want examples of where such stereotypes are most widespread (e.g., schools, work, media, advertising, politics, sports) and to understand their impacts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "gender roles" when it explicitly addresses social expectations, stereotypes, or prescribed behaviors for men, women, and other gender identities — for example discussions of how schools, workplaces, media, sports, politics, or advertising shape or reinforce gendered roles. Empirical materials such as survey questions, coding labels (e.g., qb9 entries about "gender stereotypes in schools/work/media") or analyses of examples from advertising or sport are highly relevant because they show where and how roles are enacted. Documents that are not relevant merely repeat the word "gender" as a tag or include boilerplate text without substantive commentary, or they focus exclusively on biological sex or medical issues without treating social roles. Edge cases include questionnaire dumps or duplicated survey prompts: those are useful if the user needs raw data or survey design, but less useful for someone seeking theoretical explanation or rich case studies; likewise, a piece narrowly about one context (e.g., gender roles in sports) is relevant but may miss broader generalizations.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks information on how gender role attitudes are defined and measured in social surveys, including key scales (e.g., ISSP), their dimensions (ideology, consequences, economic), evidence of change over time, and current practices for recording sex versus gender identity.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly examines gender roles as normative expectations for how men and women should behave, measures gender role attitudes, or tracks changes in these attitudes over time (e.g., ISSP’s Family and Changing Gender Roles module or dimensions like Consequence, Gender Role Ideology, and Economic Consequences). Studies debating how to record sex versus gender identity can be relevant when tied to understanding or measuring role attitudes and their societal implications. Content focused only on general survey methods, interviewer training, or unrelated psychometric scales (e.g., empathy, need for cognition, workplace mobbing) is not relevant unless it directly links those constructs to beliefs about appropriate male/female roles. Edge cases include measures of ambivalent sexism toward men or work–family conflict scales, which can be relevant when framed as consequences or manifestations of gender role ideology, whereas mere mentions of “gender” as a demographic control or measurement invariance across gender are insufficient.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks German-focused scholarly resources on Erziehung (education/child-rearing), spanning theoretical frameworks and sociological perspectives alongside practical issues like school–family–youth services cooperation, selection, inequality, gender, multiculturalism, and the public–private division of educational responsibility.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively discusses Erziehung (upbringing/education as a pedagogical practice or system), for example studies of Hilfen zur Erziehung, Heimerziehung, cooperation between youth welfare and schools, or theoretical treatments like Luhmann’s Erziehungssystem or Weber’s views on Erziehung within authority and culture. Compound and closely related terms (Erziehungssystem, öffentliche Erziehung, Erziehungswissenschaft, Erziehungsnotstand) and analyses contrasting Erziehung with Bildung also indicate strong relevance. Content that only mentions Erziehung in passing—such as a table of contents listing many topics, a brief media reference like “Super Nanny,” or a policy piece where Erziehung is peripheral—would be weakly relevant. Edge cases include works focused mainly on Bildung: they are relevant only if they explicitly tie schooling or socialization to Erziehung, and items about discrimination or gender are relevant when framed as “Erziehung gegen Rassismus” or gender in Erziehung rather than general sociology. Mentions limited to quotations, metadata, or unrelated senses (e.g., animal training) should be considered non-relevant.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking information on “Erziehung” (child-rearing/educational upbringing) in German social surveys, including parental practices, values, and styles, political and religious education, and how these relate to family background, schooling, work, and child outcomes. They likely want datasets or study summaries containing variables on upbringing within broader demographic and socio-economic contexts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “erziehung” when it explicitly addresses upbringing or child-rearing, such as parenting styles and discipline, religious or political socialization, or family roles in children’s development—for example, surveys on Erziehungsziele and Erziehungsstil, parental involvement in kindergarten, or media influences on children. Content that treats Erziehung within institutions also qualifies if the focus is socialization or pedagogy, like school-based political education, religious education, or policies affecting child-rearing (e.g., Erziehungsgeld) coupled with parental practices. It is less relevant when “Erziehung” appears only as a peripheral variable in broad topic lists (e.g., general life-course or economic surveys) or when the main emphasis is on unrelated domains such as employment history, income, or interview logistics. Edge cases include education-focused materials (Schul- und Berufsbildung) that lack discussion of values or socialization—only partially relevant—and studies of physical development or sports that merely note grades in Körpererziehung without analyzing pedagogical or parenting aspects.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The query seeks how parents prioritize specific child-rearing goals—such as independence, school success, diligence, good manners, assertiveness, empathy, responsibility, self‑confidence, and openness to criticism—when raising a roughly 10‑year‑old. It also asks about the role and importance of religious education in the family’s upbringing and current parenting.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "erziehung" when it directly discusses child‑rearing or parenting goals, practices, or evaluations — for example when it lists specific upbringing objectives (self‑reliance, good school performance, diligence, manners, assertiveness, responsibility, self‑confidence, willingness to accept criticism, understanding of others) or asks respondents to rate their importance for a ~10‑year‑old. Texts that present survey items or instructions about how to judge these aims (e.g., “use the scale on the cards”) and explicit mentions of the role of religious education are clearly on‑topic. Non‑relevant documents either use “Erziehung” in a different sense (e.g., institutional school policy, teacher training) or contain only isolated or incidental occurrences of the word without any parenting context. Edge cases include machine‑readable exports or repeated code labels (fe01, fe05, V494) which are relevant if they can be mapped to the described parenting goals but less useful if they lack explanatory labels; similarly, mentions of “religious education” may be ambiguous between family practice and institutional religion and should be examined for intent.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks information on Erziehung (child-rearing/education), focusing on key dimensions of parenting and family socialization, and how these are assessed in educational research (e.g., teacher self-concepts) and situated within classification frameworks like ISCED.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “erziehung” when it substantively discusses upbringing or education, such as parental child-rearing practices, religious socialization, or educational processes in early childhood and schooling. This paragraph is clearly relevant because it covers dimensions of parental Erziehungsverhalten (e.g., loving support and religious upbringing), poses questions about the Erziehung of children in family studies, and references ISCED’s coverage of vorschulische Erziehung. Content about the ERBSE-L instrument is relevant if it addresses the “Erziehung” subscale of teacher self-concepts, but would be less relevant if it only treated other subscales (e.g., Media or Diagnostics) without touching upbringing/education. ISCED material is relevant when it frames Erziehung within organized learning pathways; purely technical classification details without any link to upbringing or educational practice would be borderline. Edge cases include compounds and inflections (Erziehungsverhalten, erzieherisch), which count as matches, whereas passing mentions in citations or acronyms without explanatory context would be weakly relevant.</narr>

<title>religionszugehörigkeit</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking empirical research and data on religious affiliation in Germany—its distribution and how it correlates (and sometimes fails to predict) religiosity, attitudes, and behaviors (e.g., civic engagement, diversity views, family and political outcomes), including among youth, refugees, and across regions and denominations. The aim is to assess the social significance of religious affiliation relative to other factors and its implications for integration and policy debates.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly examines religious affiliation (Religionszugehörigkeit) as a measured category—such as reporting its distribution across regions or time (e.g., ALLBUS Christian/atheist shares, East–West differences) or analyzing its associations with outcomes like social capital, civic engagement, or divorce risk (e.g., lower risk among Catholics), or among refugees and youth. It is also relevant when it compares denominations (Protestant/Catholic/Muslim), uses ALLBUS/SOEP to model effects, or critically evaluates whether affiliation is an adequate proxy for religiosity, because these still center the concept and its measurement. Only marginally relevant are texts that mention the term in passing—listing it as a control in studies of family ties, including it in CV policy debates about removing private data, or legal pieces that say “regardless of religious affiliation” without analyzing affiliation. Not relevant are works about religion or secularization that never classify people by affiliation, or studies focused on other determinants (e.g., party identification, parenting roles) without claims about affiliation. Edge cases include attitude studies where results hinge on affiliation categories (e.g., homophobia linked to Islamic affiliation—relevant) and church-internal analyses of antisemitism that become relevant only if they test links between Christian affiliation and attitudes using population data.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks historical, regionally detailed statistics on religious affiliation in Germany—especially West Germany and North Rhine-Westphalia—drawn from population censuses. They want denominational distributions by state/region across time (circa 1871–2011) to analyze trends such as secularization and post-reunification shifts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it reports or analyzes religious affiliation (Religionszugehörigkeit) as legal membership categories, ideally with numeric distributions over time and/or by geography. Highly relevant examples include census-based tables for West Germany or NRW from 1871–2011 showing absolute or percentage shares of Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, and other/none, broken down by Bundesland, Regierungsbezirk, Kreis, or cities like West Berlin, and noting harmonized versus census-specific classifications. Partially relevant are broader demographic or election datasets that include Religionszugehörigkeit as one variable among many, or proxies such as church membership/church tax counts, especially when they discuss territorial changes or classification shifts across censuses. Non-relevant are texts that discuss religion in general (beliefs, religiosity, religious practice, religious education) without affiliation categories or distributions, or items where “Zugehörigkeit” refers to non-religious groups; coverage limited to unrelated regions/timeframes may also be off-topic. Edge cases include 2011 census non-response for minority religions, spelling/term variants (Religionszugehoerigkeit, Konfession), and documents clarifying that official data measure legal membership rather than personal belief—these still support relevance.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for standard survey wording and response categories for "religionszugehörigkeit" (religious affiliation), e.g., options like Catholic, Evangelical/Protestant, other, and none, often reported as percentages of the population. The underlying goal is to collect comparable data on respondents' religious denomination for analysis or presentation.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "religionszugehörigkeit" if it discusses religious affiliation directly — for example survey items, census tables, or questionnaires that list response categories like Catholic, Evangelical/Protestant, Other, or None, or that report percentages of the population by religion. Items such as interview instructions, codebooks with numeric response options (1 = Catholic, 2 = Evangelical, 3 = Other, 4 = None), or questions about preferring to live in a predominantly Catholic or Protestant village are clearly relevant because they capture denominational belonging. Documents that are not relevant include theological essays, descriptions of religious rituals, institutional histories, or organizational mission statements that do not address individual affiliation or demographic coding. Borderline cases include texts that mention "religion" only as an explanatory factor (e.g., church tax laws) or that discuss belief/practice rather than formal affiliation — these can be partially relevant depending on whether they treat membership categories (Konfession, Religionsgemeinschaft) or only attitudes. Also consider language and form variations: German synonyms (Konfession, Religionsgemeinschaft) and translated questionnaires or scanned forms are relevant, though scanned images may require OCR to extract the affiliation data.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking information on how religious affiliation is measured in standardized social science surveys in Germany, including the design and cognitive pretesting of questions and their translations. Context includes related items on COVID-19 and household income and their use in a study of Islamist attitudes among Muslim youth.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses Religionszugehörigkeit (religious affiliation) as a measured variable, question item, or data field—for example, survey instruments, pretests, or datasets that include questions on respondents’ denominational belonging, wording, translations, or coding. The provided paragraph is relevant because it states that pretested items include Religionszugehörigkeit, describes cognitive interviews around those items, and notes translations (e.g., Turkish and Arabic) and related constructs like identification with religion. Non-relevant documents would discuss religion in general (theology, religious freedom, Islamist attitudes) without asking or reporting affiliation, or only mention the term in passing without operational content. Edge cases include synonyms or variants such as Konfession, Glaubenszugehörigkeit, religious denomination/belonging in English, hyphenation or plural forms, mentions confined to variable lists or metadata, and legal/privacy discussions that reference religious affiliation but provide no measurement or data. Even if Religionszugehörigkeit appears alongside other topics (e.g., pandemic or household income) in a survey context, it remains relevant; mere thematic overlap with “religion” without affiliation does not.</narr>

<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking research on Generation Y (millennials)—who they are and how their attitudes and behaviors differ from other cohorts—particularly regarding family and gender role values, consumer/sports hero preferences, and adoption of digital health technologies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly focuses on Generation Y (also called Gen Y or Millennials), defines the cohort by birth years, and examines their attitudes, behaviors, or needs—such as comparisons with Generation X, marketing responses, or health technology usage. Examples of clearly relevant items include studies of Israeli Gen Y views on family and gender roles, research on Canadian Gen Y youth’s sport-hero preferences for endorsement strategy, and analyses of Gen Y preferences for transparency and efficiency in digital health tools. Content that only mentions an age band (e.g., 18–29 or “born after 1978”) can be conditionally relevant if it explicitly maps that band to the Generation Y cohort; otherwise, adolescent or youth studies without cohort framing are not. Non-relevant documents include those where “generation” and “y” co-occur incidentally (e.g., Spanish texts where “y” is the conjunction “and”) or materials about diasporas, labor markets, or politics that do not analyze the Gen Y cohort. Edge cases include region-specific cohort cutoffs that differ by country, mislabeling younger teens as Gen Y, and technical uses of “Y” (e.g., Y chromosome or engineering terms) that produce false positives.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks a definition of Generation Y (Millennials), including the birth-year range that defines the cohort and their typical characteristics, values, and behaviors, possibly contrasted with other generations.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “generation y” when it explicitly discusses the cohort also known as Millennials (typically born 1981–1996), uses synonyms like “Gen Y,” or analyzes their attitudes, behaviors, demographics, or outcomes (for example, Millennials’ political preferences in the 2009 EU elections or workplace expectations). It can also be relevant if it defines the cohort by birth years and segments results accordingly, such as “voters born after 1980 showed higher support for X.” By contrast, content that merely uses the letter “y” in unrelated ways (e.g., “y axis” on a political spectrum) or describes a survey and its policy statements without any age or generational framing is non-relevant, even if it includes general demographics. Edge cases include documents that provide raw age or birth-year fields enabling a clear mapping to Generation Y; these become relevant only if the cohort is actually segmented or discussed. Mentions of “young people” are relevant only when tied explicitly to the Millennial birth range rather than generic youth.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>User seeks survey-based information on Generation Y’s political behaviour and personal values — specifically which party they voted for in the most recent general election and how important they consider aspects like family, work, friends, religion, leisure, politics and living with a partner. They also want attitudes about the effects on children of family changes (divorce, single-parent households, and remarriage).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "generation y" when it explicitly addresses Generation Y (Millennials) — e.g., uses the labels Generation Y, Gen Y, or Millennials, or gives birth-year ranges or age bands (commonly born ~1981–1996) so the cohort can be identified. Relevant content usually examines Millennial-specific behaviours and attitudes such as voting patterns, political party choice in recent general elections, personal priorities (family, work, leisure, religion, friends), living arrangements (living with partner, one-parent households), or beliefs about effects on children, especially when results are reported for that cohort. Non-relevant documents include generic survey instruments or repeated question codes (v656, v688, Q92, etc.) that list items like “Which party did you vote for?” with no age/cohort information, pieces focused solely on other generations, or texts where “Y” is just a variable name and not a cohort label. Edge cases to watch for: articles that only mention Millennials in passing or give national-level results without age breakdowns are only partially relevant; documents that use synonyms (Millennial, Gen Y) or specify birth years without the label are relevant, while documents with ambiguous shorthand (just “Y”) require confirmation of meaning before counting as relevant.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user likely wants a concise definition of Generation Y (Millennials), including their birth-year range and core characteristics. They may also seek research-based insights into this cohort’s attitudes, values, and behaviors, possibly in comparison with other generations.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “generation y” if it explicitly discusses the Millennial cohort—using terms like “Generation Y,” “Gen Y,” or “Millennials”—or analyzes people born roughly 1981–1996 (with stated birth-year ranges), including their attitudes, behaviors, demographics, or comparisons to Gen X/Gen Z. It also counts if a study’s sampling, results, or interventions are targeted specifically at this cohort (e.g., workplace preferences of Millennials or survey findings segmented by Millennial birth years). By contrast, documents that use “generation” generically (e.g., intergenerational fairness), discuss “young people” without defining the Generation Y birth cohort, or focus on survey methods and general scales—as in interviewer training or broad population instruments—are non-relevant. Edge cases include mentions of “generation” in unrelated contexts (power generation, variable “y,” genetics) or materials in other languages that still clearly denote “Generation Y/Millennials,” which can be relevant if the cohort is unambiguously identified. A piece that includes many general scales but lacks a cohort-specific analysis is non-relevant, whereas a document that segments results by birth years aligning with Millennials is potentially relevant even if it doesn’t use the term “Generation Y.”</narr>

<title>generation</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The query seeks an overview of research on generations and intergenerational dynamics, focusing on cohort differences and trends in religion, trust, education and immigrant assimilation, political participation, national identity, and legal/ethical frameworks for intergenerational justice and future generations’ rights. It also notes methodological and data-generation approaches used to analyze these patterns.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it uses “generation” to mean age cohorts or intergenerational relations (e.g., analyses of first/second immigrant generations, the 1968 generation, secularization across younger vs. older generations, or legal debates about the rights of future generations), or if it uses “generation” in the production sense (e.g., data generation mechanisms or generated populations for simulations). Items focused on “generalized trust,” “generalization,” or “generativity” are typically non-relevant despite lexical overlap, unless they also explicitly analyze generations as cohorts. Strong examples from the paragraph include studies of UK ethno-generational educational attainment, Mexican American vote choice by generation, national pride shifting by birth cohort, and intergenerational justice in climate law; the “state of the art of data generation mechanisms” is also relevant in the creation sense. Edge cases include plural and compound forms like “generations,” “intergenerational,” and “next-generation” (relevant), cross-language uses such as German “Generation” (relevant), and past-tense “generated” which is relevant only when tied to the act of producing something (e.g., datasets), not when embedded in unrelated words like “generalized.” Documents that merely mention generations in passing while centering other constructs (e.g., trust without a cohort focus) may be only weakly relevant.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is looking for datasets and studies that operationalize “generation” (e.g., school cohorts, voter generations, Generation Z) and analyze cohort-specific patterns in education, political behavior, mobility, and attitudes. The focus is largely on Germany/Prussia from the 19th century to the present, including how “school generations” influenced Reichstag voting.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if “generation” is a central analytic unit, especially in the sense of age cohorts, named cohorts (e.g., Generation Z), or inter-/intragenerational dynamics. Clear signals include defining cohort boundaries (by birth years or schooling periods), comparing outcomes across cohorts (for instance, Prussian “school generations” and voter behavior 1816–1927 or youth generations 1919–1933), or coding results by “generation groups.” Methods sections or datasets that segment variables by intergenerational or intragenerational mobility, or tables explicitly labeled “generation” or “generational” are also relevant. Non-relevant material uses “generation” in unrelated senses (electricity or text/content generation), as marketing boilerplate (“next-generation”), or only incidentally (e.g., “generated variables”) without cohort-based analysis. Edge cases to include are hyphenated and variant forms (multi-generational, Gen Z) and synonyms like cohort, while near-string matches such as “General” or country names should not be treated as hits.</narr>

Also requests ratings of how important various personal domains (partner, family, friends, work, religion, leisure, politics) are and whether certain family situations (divorce, living with one parent, remarriage with a new child) have generally positive or negative effects on children.</desc>
	<narr>A relevant document will explicitly ask which party the respondent voted for at the most recent general election (e.g., “Which party did you vote for at the last General Election of [month/year]?”) or contain the same survey variables/IDs (v656, v688, v482, v1298, etc.), plus the related blocks about personal importance (family, work, friends, religion, leisure, politics) and child‑outcome questions (effects of divorce, living with one parent, remarrying). Items that reproduce the question wording, response categories, coding instructions, or respondent‑level answers are highly relevant because they map directly to the query’s content. A document that only mentions “voting behaviour” in generic terms, only records turnout (did you vote) without asking “which party,” or only discusses unrelated elections or years would be less relevant or borderline. Edge cases include templates or headers that repeat the question text without answer options (partly relevant), translations or paraphrases of the same questionnaire (still relevant), and metadata lists of variable names with no question text (low relevance).</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks social survey resources related to “generation,” such as instruments measuring intergenerational fairness and name-generator questions used in egocentric network studies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is most relevant to the query “generation” when it centrally discusses generations (age cohorts), the act of generating something (e.g., generating data, names, or content), or process-oriented “generation” such as energy generation. In this paragraph, there are weak matches: “intergenerational social support” aligns with the cohort sense, and the social network section where respondents “generate names” aligns with the verb sense; these are relevant only if the user’s intent includes those meanings. Most of the text focuses on interviewer training and various social science scales, so incidental appearances do not make it strongly relevant; words like “General” in survey names are false positives. Edge cases include brief, isolated mentions (e.g., a single item on intergenerational fairness) or uses embedded in proper nouns, which should be treated as low relevance unless the query is intentionally broad. If the user intended technical senses like text generation or electricity generation, this document would be non-relevant despite the lexical overlaps.</narr>

<title>abtreibung</title>

	<desc>The user seeks an overview of abortion as a contested social issue, including its legal regulation, historical evolution, feminist and political debates, and public attitudes. The focus is on Germany (East/West differences and post-reunification changes) with comparative perspectives from other countries.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “abtreibung” if it substantively addresses induced abortion (using terms like Abtreibung, Schwangerschaftsabbruch, Abtreibungsrecht), for example by analyzing legal frameworks (e.g., DDR vs. BRD and the 1995 law), sociological or feminist debates (such as Boltanski’s work), public opinion data (ALLBUS surveys), counseling practices, or cross-national developments (Poland, Argentina, Switzerland, USA, Russia, France). Materials that compare abortion to related issues like assisted reproduction or broader reproductive rights remain relevant when abortion is a central analytical thread, not just a passing mention. Synonyms, compounds, and variations (e.g., Abtreibungspolitik, Abtreibungsregulierung) count toward relevance; historical narratives and media discourse studies are also relevant if abortion is the focus. Non-relevant items include texts that only name “Abtreibung” in a list of topics without discussion, use the term metaphorically, or deal solely with miscarriage (Fehlgeburt) or generic gender policy without engaging abortion. As an edge case, documents centered on adjacent themes (e.g., school prayer or environmental ethics) are only weakly relevant unless they explicitly tie their arguments to abortion policy or activism.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks information on abortion—particularly public attitudes, policy preferences, and related factors like religion, politics, contraception, and demographics—across multiple social surveys and datasets. It aims to identify where abortion is measured within broader studies (e.g., church and youth work, family planning, electoral behavior, EU issues) and what variables or questions are included.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses abortion (Abtreibung), including legal frameworks (e.g., §218 StGB), moral or religious debates, access and policy, or measured attitudes and behaviors, and it may use synonyms like Schwangerschaftsabbruch. Examples of relevance include survey modules asking about permissibility under conditions (rape, health risk to the mother, fetal impairment, social/economic reasons), church modernization debates that mention a more liberal stance on abortion, youth or family planning studies linking abortion with contraception, and political content such as referenda or EU policy discussions that reference abortion laws. Materials on reproductive health that explicitly include abortion alongside pregnancy, contraception, or adolescents’ knowledge and attitudes also qualify. Non-relevant cases include texts where “abtreibung” appears only incidentally in metadata, or documents focused solely on miscarriage/stillbirth (Fehlgeburt, Totgeburt) or veterinary/animal “abortion” rather than human pregnancy termination. Edge cases: a brief mention of abortion as one item in a long list is only weakly relevant, whereas documents using the synonym Schwangerschaftsabbruch or rating scales of abortion acceptance are relevant even without extensive discussion.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>Looking for survey items and variable codes that measure public attitudes toward abortion—specifically whether respondents approve or disapprove of abortion in different scenarios (unmarried woman, fetal handicap, threat to the mother’s life, couple not wanting more children). The query likely aims to map or interpret the dataset variables/questions (e.g., V229, AT46, Q53D) that record these approval/disapproval responses.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant when it contains the actual survey items, codebook entries or questionnaire text about abortion attitudes — for example the German phrases “Abtreibung,” “Beurteilung Abtreibung,” or question stems like “Billigen Sie eine Abtreibung unter den folgenden Umständen…,” and the specific scenario items (child likely handicapped, mother’s life endangered, woman unmarried, couple doesn’t want more children) or the variable IDs shown (V229, Q53D, V178, AT46, etc.). Relevant examples include survey questionnaires, variable documentation, codebooks, dataset metadata, or translated question lists that reproduce those exact items and response options (approve/disapprove). A document is non‑relevant if it only discusses abortion medically or legally without reporting survey question wording or variable codes, if it merely mentions “abortion” tangentially, or if it lists unrelated variables that do not match the displayed item codes and scenarios. Edge cases: aggregated reports that give results for these items but omit the original question wording or response coding are partially relevant (useful for results but not for wording), while documents containing the codes but corrupted OCR or missing scenario text may be ambiguous and require inspection to confirm relevance.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking the specific legal paragraph(s) on abortion in German law (commonly §218 StGB), including the statutory text, what conduct is prohibited or permitted, applicable exceptions, penalties, and any procedural rules or recent legal changes.</desc>
	<narr>Relevant documents explicitly address "Abtreibung" together with the legal paragraph or statutes that govern it (for example discussions of Germany’s §218 StGB), court decisions, official government guidance, medical protocols for lawful terminations, or scholarly/legal commentary that quotes or analyzes the specific paragraph. Examples of strong relevance are the text of the criminal code, explanatory notes from a health ministry, legal blogs that cite the paragraph number and its amendments, or news stories that explain how a particular paragraph was applied in a court case. Non-relevant documents merely use the term in passing, use "paragraph" in a typographic or editorial sense, discuss unrelated statutory paragraphs, or focus only on personal anecdotes without linking to legal text. Edge cases include historical or comparative pieces that mention an old version of the paragraph (relevant for context), translations that use "abortion" instead of "Abtreibung" (still relevant), and opinion pieces that reference the paragraph number but do not explain its content (partially relevant). Look for clear signals of legal citation, quoted statutory language, or authoritative sources to determine strong relevance.</narr>

<title>klima</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks a comprehensive overview of climate and climate change, including anthropogenic drivers, historical variability, modeling and future scenarios, and sectoral impacts. They also want analysis of how food systems, energy and biofuels policy, and multi-level governance (EU, G7, UN COPs) shape climate action, with case studies (e.g., Poland, Ukraine) and related social, spatial-planning, and security dimensions.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “klima” when it addresses climate in the environmental sense—e.g., anthropogenic greenhouse gases, climate change impacts and variability, climate models and scenarios, mitigation/adaptation, or climate policy and diplomacy such as COP24/COP29, EU 2040 targets, G7 “Klimaclub,” emissions reduction, and climate finance. Sectoral links like food systems and land use (diet-related emissions, agricultural vulnerability in Ukraine) or energy/industry topics framed as “Klima- und Energiepolitik” also count as relevant. By contrast, uses of “Klima” as a metaphor for social or political mood (e.g., attitudes toward gender roles, civility of debate, “politisches Klima” around parties) are non-relevant unless explicitly tied back to environmental climate governance. Edge cases include hyphenated compounds and derivatives (Klimawandel, Klimaschutz, Klimaanpassung), one-off mentions that don’t substantively discuss climate, or “Klima” referring to air conditioning/brands or a surname, which should be excluded. German-language content is expected, but English pieces about “climate” can be relevant if the retrieval is cross-lingual and the topical focus matches.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user wants surveys and datasets related to “klima” (climate), spanning environmental climate change and climate protection as well as measures of social, political, and organizational climate. The focus is on German and EU contexts, including youth and general population attitudes, school/workplace climate, and broader public opinion.</desc>
	<narr>A document is clearly relevant to the query “klima” if it addresses environmental climate topics or climate change, such as surveys on “Klima und Umwelt,” youth attitudes toward climate protection, or historical time series on “Umwelt, Klima und Natur” (e.g., the Hamburg BUS survey, the youth climate study, or Deutschland in Daten). It is also relevant when “Klima” appears in compounds like Klimaschutz, Klimawandel, or Klima- und Umweltpolitik. Partially relevant or ambiguous are metaphorical uses like “soziales Klima,” “Unterrichtsklima,” “Arbeitsklima,” or “politisches Klima” (e.g., teacher surveys on collegial climate or Eurobarometer modules on social climate), which match the keyword but may not satisfy an environmental-climate intent. Non-relevant are documents that do not mention “Klima” at all or only use unrelated senses (e.g., “Klimaanlage” for air conditioning or idioms like “ein Klima der Geborgenheit”) without any environmental context. Edge cases include case-insensitive matches, hyphenation, and German compounding, so hits like “Schutz von Umwelt und Klima” should be counted, whereas items focused solely on school cooperation or voter behavior without a climate facet should not.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for information about "klima" (climate) in the context of survey and media-topic data — specifically public interest in climate/weather disasters and coded media topics, and survey responses on whether recent floods are attributed to climate change. They likely want the relevant survey question results, coding categories (e.g. Klima/Wetterkatastrophen, Hochwasser), and summary statistics on public belief about climate-change causes of flooding.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "klima" when it explicitly discusses climate or climate change — e.g., occurrences of "Klima", "Klimaveränderung", "Klima Wetterkatastrophen" or sentences like "das Hochwasser ist hauptsächlich eine Folge der Klimaveränderung" that link weather events to climate. Lists of media topics that contain entries such as "Klima Wetterkatastrophen" or repeated mentions of "Hochwasser" in the context of climate are also strong relevance signals. A document is non‑relevant if "klima" appears only as a numeric code, a stray token, or in a different sense (for example "political climate" or an unrelated compound where meaning is ambiguous) without substantive climate content. Edge cases include negated statements (people saying flooding is not due to climate change—which are still relevant because they address climate perceptions), OCR/truncation errors like "KLIMAVERäND", and language issues (German text is fine, but ensure the term is used in climate sense). For ranking, give higher weight to prominent, repeated, or contextualized mentions (headlines, survey questions, or explanatory sentences) and lower weight to single incidental occurrences.</narr>

They want to know the dimensions these tools assess (e.g., positive emotional climate, leisure, organization, control, intellectual-cultural orientation; meaningfulness and competence) and their use as brief screening instruments for well-being and performance.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “klima” if it discusses “Klima” in German, including social/organizational contexts (e.g., Familienklima, Betriebsklima) as well as meteorological climate. The given paragraph is relevant because it explicitly treats Familienklima via subscales (positive-emotional climate, control, organization, etc.) and introduces an Organisations-/Berufs-Klima-Index (BOKX) measuring perceived meaning and competence. Terms like “Familienklimaskalen,” “Organisationsklima,” and “Klimaindex” should count as matches since German compounds and hyphenations contain the “Klima” stem, and matching should be case-insensitive. Non-relevant content would include occurrences where “Klima” appears in unrelated compounds (e.g., Klimaanlage/air conditioner) or where BOKX is discussed purely as a wellbeing or performance tool without any climate framing. Edge cases include documents using synonyms without the exact token (e.g., “soziales Klima,” “Betriebsklima”), which are topically relevant, and meteorological pieces (e.g., Klimawandel) that match the keyword but are thematically less aligned with this paragraph’s focus on family/organizational climate.</narr>

<title>islam</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an academic overview of contemporary Islam and Islamism, emphasizing the distinction between moderate and radical currents, their relationship to democracy and secularism, and economic dimensions such as Islamic banking. They want comparative case studies (e.g., Indonesia, Turkey, West Africa, Europe, Russia) showing how Islamic discourse shapes politics, society, and global diplomacy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “islam” when Islam—the religion, its communities, doctrines, movements, or institutions—is the central focus, indicated by substantive, frequent use of terms like Islam, Islamic, Muslim, Shari‘a, or Islamism. Analyses of political Islam/Islamism in Arab societies, Indonesia’s “moderate Islam” diplomacy and Islamic higher education, Islamic banking and finance in Germany or Tajikistan, or studies of Islam and democracy (such as national surveys in Indonesia) are highly relevant because they use Islam to explain politics, economics, or society. Works on Sufism or Islam in Africa, Islamic entrepreneurs in Turkey, or historical debates on secularism within Islamic thought remain relevant if Islam frames the argument, while pieces that only mention Muslims in passing or treat globalization with a brief nod to Islam are marginal. Items that match the string incidentally (e.g., place names like Islamabad, brand names, or “Islamic” used loosely without engaging Islamic beliefs, institutions, or communities) are non-relevant; likewise, generic banking or legal articles without a Shari‘a dimension should be down-ranked. Edge cases include critiques centered on “Islamism” (still relevant because they analyze movements rooted in Islamic discourse) and discussions of pre-Islamic contexts or “Islamicate secularities” that are relevant only when explicitly tied to how Islam is defined, practiced, or contested.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking empirical datasets and studies on Islam/Muslims in Germany that estimate population size and composition and detail demographics, religious practice, integration, and schooling. They also want surveys of broader public attitudes toward Islam and related political issues in Germany and Europe, accounting for census limitations and methodological notes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “islam” if it directly addresses Islam or Muslims—for example, estimating the number of Muslims in Germany, describing Islamic beliefs and practices, or analyzing integration, headscarf use, Islamic education, or recognition of Islamic associations (e.g., DITIB, ZMD, VIKZ). Surveys that measure public attitudes toward Islam—such as “Islam belongs to Germany,” monitoring Islamic communities, compatibility of Islam and democracy, or perceptions of “Islamic fundamentalism”—are also relevant, even when framed as security or foreign-policy items. By contrast, texts focused solely on Christian church membership trends or generic religion without Islam-specific data, or datasets where Muslims are only tangentially mentioned (e.g., in a long list of religions) or omitted due to non-response with no imputation, are non-relevant. Edge cases include documents where “Islam” appears only as an example, where affiliation reflects legal membership rather than belief, or where Alevis are included/excluded ambiguously; these are weakly relevant unless they analyze Muslims or Islam-specific outcomes. Technical details about sampling, geocoding, or weighting are not relevant unless they specifically enable Islam-focused estimates or subnational analysis of Muslims.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The query asks for a personal opinion on whether German state schools should offer Islamic religious instruction (as opposed to only Christian instruction or no religious instruction) and asks respondents to indicate agreement or disagreement with a series of statements about Islam and Muslims (e.g., whether Muslims cause conflicts, whether Muslim faith should be limited or monitored by the state, whether Islam fits into German society, and whether a Muslim mayor would be acceptable).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "islam" if it substantively discusses Islam or Muslims — for example debates about Islamic religious instruction in state schools, public attitudes toward Muslim mayors, or policy measures like monitoring Muslim communities or limiting the exercise of Muslim faith. Strong relevance is signaled by explicit phrases such as "Islamic religious instruction," "Muslim children," "state schools," "exercise of Muslim faith," or the survey/item codes (ma08, mm01–mm05) that map to these topics. A document is non-relevant if it only mentions Islam in passing, uses the word as an unrelated acronym, or contains duplicated boilerplate survey prompts without new content; however, a repetitive survey transcript that contains those exact items can still be relevant for analysis despite low narrative value. Edge cases include texts about general "religious instruction" that do not specify Muslims (less relevant) and multilingual or mis-tagged documents where the word appears but the substance is about a different issue (not relevant).</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking details about a survey scale that measures attitudes toward Islam in Germany, specifically the instrument used in the 2012 ALLBUS study. They likely want its purpose, items/methodology, and key findings or availability.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “islam” if it substantively discusses Islam as a religion, culture, or social phenomenon—covering beliefs, practices, history, demographics, Muslim communities, or societal attitudes toward Islam. For example, the paragraph describing a scale that measures attitudes toward Islam in Germany and its use in the ALLBUS 2012 survey is clearly relevant because it directly analyzes perceptions of Islam. Documents using related terms like “Islamic” or “Muslim” in meaningful contexts (e.g., Islamic law, Islamic art, Muslim populations in Europe) are also relevant. Non-relevant cases include uses of “Islam” as a personal surname, place names like “Islamabad,” or brief, incidental mentions where Islam is not the subject. Edge cases include articles on groups like “Islamic State” or security topics that use the term “Islamic” but focus solely on geopolitics or militancy without discussing Islam itself, which may be only tangentially relevant.</narr>

<title>klimawandel</title>

	<desc>The user seeks scholarly resources on climate change that analyze its political framing and governance, including mitigation and adaptation strategies—particularly in urban and regional planning. They also want insights into social impacts and vulnerabilities (gender, poverty, conflict, migration, human rights) with region-specific cases from Europe, Russia, Africa, and developing countries.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses climate change (Klimawandel) as a phenomenon or policy problem—its causes (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions), impacts (sea-level rise, extreme weather, water/food insecurity), or responses (mitigation, adaptation), including political discourse and governance. Examples include analyses of party platforms in Germany/Austria/Switzerland, urban and regional planning tools for climate adaptation, gendered effects of climate policy, links between climate and conflict or migration, human-rights and development implications, or region-specific discussions (e.g., Russia’s climate debate, Africa’s vulnerability). Works that define concepts (glossaries), frame Klimawandel theoretically (e.g., “super wicked problem”), or evaluate adaptation programs and funding are also relevant. Non-relevant are texts that use “Klima” in unrelated senses (business/organizational climate, air-conditioning), pieces that only name-drop Klimawandel without analysis, or content limited to short-term weather with no climate link. Edge cases include broader planning or security papers where climate change is just one driver; these are weakly or partially relevant unless the depth and proportion of discussion on adaptation/mitigation or climate impacts is substantial, and synonyms like “global warming” or “greenhouse effect” also count.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is looking for surveys and datasets on public opinions about climate change and climate policy in Germany and the EU, including views on mitigation measures, renewables vs. nuclear, oil and gas supply, and the energy transition. They also seek methodological and demographic details from sources such as GIP, Eurobarometer, and ISSP.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses climate change (Klimawandel) itself—its causes, impacts, or responses—such as public attitudes toward climate policy, CO2 emissions, renewable energy, nuclear power, adaptation, extreme weather, or willingness to pay for climate protection. Survey descriptions and questionnaires that include dedicated “Klimawandel” modules, questions on EU or national measures, personal behaviors (e.g., flying, energy saving), or policy instruments (CO2 tax, tempolimits, subsidies) are clearly relevant. Materials that only list climate change as one of many topics without further detail, or that discuss adjacent issues (EU elections, poverty, or general environment) without explicit linkage to climate change, are weakly or non-relevant. Edge cases include energy-security discussions or “Energiewende” content that are relevant only if tied to emissions and climate goals, and documents where “Klimawandel” appears merely as a keyword tag or passing mention, which should be treated as low relevance. Synonymous or related terms in German or English (e.g., Klimaschutz, globale Erwärmung, greenhouse gases) also signal relevance when they directly concern climate change.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is asking whether climate change is a serious problem, what its impacts will be for people in Germany, and whether the world is likely to succeed in limiting or reversing it (including whether they should be worried). They likely want a concise summary of causes, projected local impacts, and the prospects for mitigation and adaptation.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "klimawandel" when it contains substantive discussion of climate change—its causes, impacts, mitigation, policy, or public opinion—especially if it focuses on Germany (e.g., an article titled "Ist der Klimawandel für uns in Deutschland..." or a survey analyzing German attitudes). Simple metadata or repeated headings such as "V265 Klimawandel gr. Problem" or long blocks of duplicate lines add little relevance unless they link to full content; for example, an index entry “V295 KLIMAWANDEL GR. PROBLEM” is less useful than a paragraph explaining why it’s a problem. Language and lexical variants matter: German terms, capitalization, synonyms like "Klimakrise" or English "climate change"/"global warming", and common OCR/misspellings should be matched to avoid false negatives, while question forms (“Ist der Klimawandel…?”) often indicate survey or opinion material that is still relevant. Edge cases include noisy schedule fragments ("in Woche 50"), repeated IDs, or transcript headers—these reduce standalone value but may be relevant if they point to substantive transcripts or linked articles, so deduplication and context checks are important.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “klimawandel” when it substantively discusses climate change—its attitudes, impacts, policies, or measurement—such as project descriptions or survey modules focused on climate change and energy. For example, descriptions of PAWCER’s work on welfare-state attitudes alongside climate change/energy, FReDA W6a items on climate change and fertility, or FGZ panel questions about climate change all clearly qualify. Content that centers on other topics (e.g., antisemitism, gender equality, left–right scales, or income redistribution) and only mentions climate change in passing is only weakly relevant. Methodological reports (cognitive interviews, web probing) that reference “Klimawandel” merely as labels for test items may match the keyword but be less useful to users seeking substantive findings. Edge cases include documents using synonyms like “Klimakrise” or “Erderwärmung” or related domains like energy policy (topically relevant but may not match a strict keyword), and uses of “Klima” to mean social climate or branding, which are non-relevant.</narr>

Also looks for differences across occupations and demographics and the importance of supportive home conditions.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it discusses “home office” as working from home/telework, including access, usage, policies or contracts, time recognition, impacts on stress or work–life balance, and conditions that make home working effective or harmful. Examples of relevance include surveys on telework during COVID-19, analyses of who can use home office and how much, studies of “home office environment,” and accounts of freelancers performing editorial work from their home offices; synonyms like telework, remote work, WFH, and German-language “Homeoffice” also count. Non-relevant items use “Home Office” to mean the UK government department, refer to “office” or “home” in unrelated contexts (statistical offices, branch offices, private offices/cabinets, officer corps), or describe work done in clients’ homes (e.g., psychiatric teams’ field visits) or home gardening. Edge cases include “home office” as a corporate headquarters or central admin (“return to the home office”), missionary “home office management,” or interior design of a home-office room—these are only relevant if they concern employment practices of working from one’s residence. Capitalization differences and multilingual usage should be considered, but the core criterion is a focus on employment performed from home rather than government agencies, physical offices, or unrelated “home” activities.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is looking for survey data on home office/remote work in Germany, including whether and how often people work from home, shifts to home office during COVID-19, and reasons or barriers. They also want attitudes toward legal regulation or a right to home office, along with related demographics.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “home office” when it discusses working from home as a form of paid employment, including measurement of workplace location (e.g., “at home in the home office”), remote/telework or hybrid arrangements, changes in work patterns during COVID (“more home office”), or attitudes toward policies such as a legal regulation on home office and reasons for wanting or rejecting it. It remains relevant if home office is only one module among many topics, as long as it contains concrete items or results about prevalence, interest, or regulation of working from home. By contrast, texts about “old people’s homes,” nursing homes, or housing, and mentions of “offices” as public authorities (Press and Information Office, employment office, social services office) are non-relevant because they do not concern remote work. Edge cases include “work at home” referring to unpaid housework or historical piecework; count it only if it clearly means paid job tasks done from home, and ignore uses of “Home Office” as the UK ministry unless the document is specifically about that institution. Strong relevance signals include variables on current place of work, shifts to home office during the pandemic, and questions about legal regulation or personal interest in home office.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A query for "home office Paragraph" is looking for survey questionnaire items and response codes about political authority (whether the Head of State can dismiss/demote or promote high‑ranking officers), the respondent’s job (e.g., professional officer) and the main business activity of their workplace. It also seeks items on awareness/use of EC information offices and aid agencies (ECHO, UNICEF, UNHCR, WFP, USAID), public computer access, access to dental care, use of tourist information offices, and attitudes/knowledge about smoking regulations.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "home office" when it specifically addresses an office located in a private residence (e.g., working-from-home arrangements, home-based business classifications, home office tax deductions, or guidance on setting up a room as an office) or when the user likely means the proper noun "Home Office" (the government ministry) and the text discusses that department. Relevant examples include survey items that ask whether you work at home, references to a home-based establishment, or policies and services provided by a government Home Office. The paragraph above mostly lists generic or institutional "offices" — EC information offices in Brussels or Copenhagen, tourist information offices, dentist's office, public offices, and questions about computer use at public access points — which are non-relevant because they do not pertain to a residential workspace or the Home Office ministry. Edge cases to watch for: a line like "office ... where you work" can be relevant if elsewhere it specifies "at home" or "home-based," and documents that only contain the token "office" (codes, repeated inventory text, or translations like ECHO) are false positives unless they explicitly connect to "home" or the Home Office entity.</narr>

	<desc>The user likely wants guidance on setting up and managing a home office for remote work, including workspace design, essential equipment, ergonomics, productivity practices, and any relevant workplace or tax policies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “home office” if it substantively addresses working from home or a home-based workspace—e.g., telework policies, ergonomics and equipment, productivity practices, tax/legal issues, or statistics on remote work prevalence—and, in an alternate sense, if it pertains to the UK Home Office as a governmental body. The provided paragraph concentrates on German Microcensus methods, cohabiting unions, the EGP class scheme, and psychometric scales, none of which discuss home-based work arrangements or the UK ministry. Mentions of “office workers” or “Access to Home Familiarity” are incidental and relate to measurement scales, not to home-office setups or remote work practices, so they don’t satisfy the query. Edge cases that would count include a survey methodology paper specifically measuring home-office use or telework in the Microcensus, or a policy analysis from the UK Home Office; merely containing the words “home” and “office” separately is not sufficient.</narr>

They want scholarly overviews, frameworks, empirical findings, and insight into current trends, rankings, and controversies (e.g., extremism prevention, professionalism, and the relation to democracy education).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly treats politische Bildung as its subject—defining its aims and core concepts (e.g., the “Politikbegriff”), debating its relationship to Demokratiepädagogik, outlining didactics and methods, or analyzing its institutional settings in schools, vocational education, and adult or out-of-school youth education in German-speaking contexts. Clear examples include studies that compare curriculum time for political education (Sekundarstufe I rankings), analyses of political education in vocational schools, empirical mappings of adult political education, or theory-led pieces applying Bourdieu or Laclau/Mouffe to political learning, participation, and Mündigkeit. Adjacent topics are also relevant when explicitly situated within political education, such as extremism prevention in curricula, the aesthetics of political mediation in classrooms, professionalization/teacher training, or critiques of neoliberal competence frameworks that shape political education practice. Non-relevant are documents that discuss politics or sociology in general without linking to political education, education policy pieces not about the political/civic domain, or texts that only mention the term in passing; likewise, work solely on democracy education is borderline unless it connects or contrasts with politische Bildung. Edge cases: cross-national or historical-institutional treatments (e.g., journals, associations) are relevant if they center on political education, and English synonyms like civic or citizenship education typically qualify when the focus matches the field of politische Bildung.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking surveys and datasets on political education and civic engagement, including political interest, media use and preferred information sources, knowledge and trust in institutions, participation, and related attitudes, with demographic breakdowns. The focus is primarily on Germany (e.g., Saxony) and includes references to institutions and studies such as the Bundes-/Landeszentrale für politische Bildung, the German Internet Panel, and media literacy research.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly treats politische Bildung (civic/political education) as its focus, for example by surveying interest in political learning, preferred and used sources for political education, trust in and use of institutions that provide it (e.g., Bundes- oder Landeszentralen für politische Bildung, political foundations like Konrad Adenauer or Friedrich Ebert, parties, Volkshochschulen, universities), participation in educational events, or the likelihood of seeking offerings. Studies on media literacy and journalism use are also relevant when framed as civic education (e.g., Sächsische Landeszentrale studies on media competence, continuing education needs, and support for media pedagogy). Non-relevant are datasets centered on elections, party preference, EU or security policy, or general socio-economic attitudes without an explicit link to political education programs, institutions, curricula, or learning outcomes (even if they mention political interest or demographics). Edge cases include documents about “Bildung” or media use: they count only if they connect to civic/political learning goals, methods, or providers; pure campaign polling, generic political attitudes, or international cases without a civic-education component should be excluded. Evaluations or positions on state support for civic education in schools and society, and assessments of how such institutions contribute to democracy, are strongly relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user seeks information on "politische Bildung" in the context of German public-opinion survey questions about education policy, government/coalition formation, and state budget priorities (cuts vs. investment). They likely want explanations of these survey items, summaries of public attitudes or trends, and how political parties and coalitions influence education funding and policy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "politische Bildung" when it explicitly addresses civic or political education topics — for example discussions of curricula for democracy education, party positions on school civics, state funding for civic programs, or surveys asking about opinions on political-education policy. Mentions of "Bildung" that concern education funding, investments in schooling, or statements like "SPD fordert deutliche Erhöhung staatlicher Investitionen in Bildung" are likely relevant because they tie education to public policy. Documents are non-relevant when "Bildung" is used in a different sense (e.g., the formation of a government: "Bildung einer Koalition") or when the text only concerns vocational training, internships, or general continuing education without political/civic content. Edge cases include texts that mention coalitions and party negotiations: these are relevant only if they contain explicit debate about political-education policy or curricula; otherwise they should be treated as irrelevant political procedural content. Duplicate or noisy survey fragments that repeat questions without substantive content about civic education should be deprioritized.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses civic or political education (politische Bildung), such as curricula, pedagogy, learning objectives (e.g., political literacy, democratic values, participation), program providers (e.g., bpb), or evaluations of educational interventions—especially in school, youth work, or adult education. Studies that use measurement tools like political efficacy scales (e.g., PEKS) are relevant when they assess learning outcomes in an educational setting, but not when they are used in general population surveys without a teaching/learning component. Documents focused on general educational attainment or classification (e.g., ISCED), education policy (Bildungspolitik), electoral behavior panels, or political attitude scales (e.g., KPZ) are non-relevant unless they are directly tied to civic education aims or pedagogy. Edge cases include research on political socialization or self-efficacy among youth, which is relevant only if situated in educational contexts, and training for politicians or party academies, which is typically non-relevant unless framed as citizen-oriented civic education. Content may be in German or other languages; works on “citizenship education” in other countries are also relevant if they address the same civic education goals and methods.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking comprehensive scholarly information on homosexuality, spanning historical and psychoanalytic theories, legal and policy regimes, education and religion, media/sports discourse, and the lived experiences of gay and lesbian people. The goal is to understand how homosexuality has been conceptualized, regulated, and stigmatized across time and institutions, particularly in German/European contexts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses homosexuality (Homosexualität) as identity, practice, social/medical concept, policy target, or cultural discourse—e.g., psychoanalytic treatments of homosexual patients, school and religious-pedagogy approaches, National Socialist constructions and persecution, football “outing” debates, Russia’s 2013 “propaganda” law and hate-crime trends, or studies of Berlin youths’ attitudes. Comparative works that analyze homosexuality alongside intersexuality, transsexuality, or heterosexuality are relevant when they devote meaningful sections to homosexuality or use it centrally to argue about gender/sexual science; historical or synonymous terms such as Homophilie, Sodomie, gleichgeschlechtliche Liebe, schwul, and LSBTI also signal relevance. Empirical studies (surveys, interviews, statistics) and theoretical critiques (e.g., Foucaultian analyses, social-construction debates) qualify as long as homosexuality is a primary object, not a passing example. Non-relevant items include texts that only mention the term in passing, works focused solely on other gender/sexuality categories without substantive discussion of homosexuality, or duplicate summaries that add no new content. Edge cases include male-centric historical overviews (still relevant but narrow in scope) or analyses within period-specific frames (e.g., Roman active/passive norms, Nazi “deficit” narratives), which remain relevant if they critically engage homosexuality in those contexts.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively discusses homosexuality as identity, behavior, attitudes, or policy—e.g., surveys measuring “Einstellung zur Homosexualität,” studies of coming out, same-sex relationships, discrimination, or contact with gay/lesbian people, or modules linking homosexuality to health topics like HIV/AIDS. Materials that analyze acceptance of homosexuality within broader value indices (World/European Values, Eurobarometer), or that focus on specific contexts such as students, the military, youth socialization, or evaluations of films about homosexuality are also relevant. Documents that only list the word “Homosexualität” in passing, treat it as a minor checkbox among many unrelated items without any findings or description, or that discuss unrelated concepts (e.g., homophones/technical terms) are non-relevant. Edge cases include broad social surveys where homosexuality is one of several attitude scales (still relevant if the variable is present and described) and datasets aggregating acceptance as a subcomponent (relevant if the role of the component is clear).</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>The user wants information about homosexuality in professional football, specifically how active players who come out are perceived and whether they would receive acceptance and support from teammates, fans, and institutions. They are asking about current attitudes, prevalence of openly gay active players, and examples or evidence of support or discrimination.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "homosexualität" if it directly treats homosexuality as its subject—e.g., news reports or interviews about Thomas Hitzlsperger coming out, pieces on whether active professional footballers can or do come out, public reaction, anti-discrimination policies, or social-science research on attitudes toward gay athletes. Concrete examples of relevant documents include a German-language press article quoting Hitzlsperger, an interview with an active player about coming out, or an opinion piece on acceptance in football. Non-relevant documents merely containing the word in passing (for example a match report that briefly mentions a player's sexual orientation without discussion), using a different meaning, or unrelated pages (spam, unrelated biographies) should be excluded. Edge cases include content about homosexual behavior in animals or legal definitions of homosexuality—which may be tangentially relevant depending on user intent—as well as ambiguous mentions, translation errors, or private-person speculation that raise privacy and sensitivity concerns.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>A short informative paragraph that defines homosexuality — the pattern of romantic or sexual attraction to people of the same sex — and summarizes its social, cultural, and legal context. The user likely wants a concise, neutral explanation suitable for an essay, schoolwork, or general background.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "homosexualität" if it substantially discusses homosexuality—its definitions, history, legal status, health issues, social attitudes, cultural representation, or policy debates—especially when written in German or using closely related terms like "homosexuality," "gay," "lesbisch," or "LGBT." Relevant examples include scholarly articles on the history of homosexuality in Germany, news reports about LGBT rights, advocacy pages, medical or psychological analyses, and law texts that explicitly address the status of homosexual people. A document is non-relevant if the term appears only incidentally (e.g., a single passing mention, a filename, or metadata), if the content is about an unrelated subject that only uses the word in a quote or list, or if the page is purely an image with no textual discussion. Edge cases include pornographic or hate sites that mention the term—these are topically relevant but may be low quality or unsafe—and documents that use compound or misspelled forms (e.g., "homosexualitätsdiskurs" or "homosexuality") which should still be considered relevant if the core topic matches. Title and heading mentions usually indicate higher relevance than brief body mentions, and translations or synonym-heavy pages should be evaluated for depth of coverage rather than keyword presence alone.</narr>

<title>kriminalitätsfurcht</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks scholarly research on fear of crime, including its dimensions (cognitive/affective/behavioral), gender differences and determinants (resources, norms, neighborhood, lifestyle, media/policing), the mismatch with objective crime trends, and methodological critiques of standard measures, with evidence from German and comparative surveys (e.g., ALLBUS, GSS, victimization surveys).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses Kriminalitätsfurcht (fear of crime) as a concept, its dimensions (e.g., cognitive risk appraisal, affective fear, and conative avoidance), its predictors (gender differences, incivilities, neighborhood composition, police presence, media exposure), or its trends across time or countries using surveys like ALLBUS, GSS, SOEP, or local victimization studies. Analyses that critique measurement—such as the validity of “feeling unsafe alone at night” as a standard indicator, factor-analytic tests, or nonresponse bias in victimization surveys—are also highly relevant, as are models framing fear as a stress process or linking it to punitivity. Examples include studies showing women’s persistently higher fear, the decoupling of objective crime rates from fear, or the impact of egalitarian gender norms on fear without eliminating the gender gap. Non-relevant are pieces that only report crime rates, policing data, or general urban disorder without connecting them to perceived fear, or texts about “fear” unrelated to crime. Edge cases include discussions of “broken windows” or media effects that mention fear indirectly (relevant if they measure or theorize fear), or purely political commentaries on urban governance that invoke fear rhetorically without empirical or conceptual treatment (usually not relevant).</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks German survey data and documentation on fear of crime, including measures of perceived safety, victimization across offense types (e.g., theft, assault, burglary, cybercrime), reporting behavior, and protective actions. They also want how these metrics relate to demographics and political attitudes/voting, with details on methodology, regional coverage, and longitudinal comparisons.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “kriminalitätsfurcht” if it measures or analyzes fear of crime or perceived safety, for example via survey items on Sicherheitsgefühl in the neighborhood at night, Beunruhigung about being assaulted or burglarized, delikt­spezifische Kriminalitätsfurcht (theft, assault, burglary, cybercrime), expected victimization probabilities, and avoidance or protective behaviors taken due to fear. Studies and datasets that explicitly include a Kriminalitätsfurcht module or closely related constructs such as Sicherheitsempfinden, Beunruhigung, incivilities/disorder, and fear of terrorism or online crime (phishing, identity theft, malware) are clearly relevant; examples include the Deutscher Viktimisierungssurvey and “Sicherheit und Kriminalität in Sachsen 2022,” as well as election or opinion polls that ask about one’s own Kriminalitätsfurcht. Documents are non‑relevant when they focus solely on crime control policy (Kriminalitätsbekämpfung), party preferences, general demographics, or raw victimization counts without assessing fear, or when Kriminalitätsfurcht is only name‑checked without corresponding questions or measures. Edge cases that should still count include sections using synonyms like Sicherheitsempfinden or items such as “Sicherheitsgefühl nachts in der Wohngegend” even if the exact term Kriminalitätsfurcht is absent, and modules on fear tied to specific settings (public transport, workplace) or to internet security. Conversely, election studies that mention crime only as a policy competence area, or datasets where Kriminalitätsfurcht appears in a keyword list but no related variables are present, should be treated as non‑relevant or borderline.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants to know whether there are any areas — especially within about one kilometer or elsewhere in their town/municipality — that people consider unsafe to walk alone at night. This information measures personal fear of crime and the perceived spatial distribution of neighbourhood safety.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "kriminalitätsfurcht" (fear of crime) if it addresses people's perceptions of safety—especially references to not wanting to walk alone at night, descriptions of specific local areas or neighborhoods within a short distance (e.g., within one kilometer), survey questions or interview transcripts asking about such avoidance, or first‑hand reports like “I avoid the park after dark.” The repeated paragraph here clearly contains a survey/interview prompt about local night‑time avoidance, so any document containing that text would be highly relevant as it directly measures fear of crime in the immediate vicinity. Documents that only give raw crime statistics, legal definitions, or policy descriptions without linking them to residents’ perceived safety are generally non‑relevant, because they do not capture the subjective fear the query targets. Borderline cases include materials about crime prevention or policing that imply changes in fear (relevant if they report residents’ reactions) and noisy transcripts or repeated lines (like this paragraph) which are still relevant if they reflect the original survey wording or respondent answers.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks information on how the EU AUDITS project measures “fear of crime” and related perceptions of safety—via citizen surveys and a cognitive online pretest using web probing—to inform local security and prevention policy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “kriminalitätsfurcht” (fear of crime) when it explicitly discusses citizens’ fear of crime or perceived safety, especially in contexts like surveys, methodological tools, or policy design—as this text does by describing an EU project that pretests questions on fear of crime and subjective security in municipalities using web probing. Materials that detail measurement instruments (e.g., questionnaires on perceived safety), analytical approaches, or findings about fear of crime, including related constructs like “subjektives Sicherheitsempfinden” or “perceived safety,” are also relevant. By contrast, content focusing only on traffic safety, general security policy, or “audits” in unrelated domains (e.g., financial or IT security audits) without addressing fear of crime would be non-relevant. Edge cases include documents that mention kriminalitätsfurcht only in passing within a broader safety framework, which may be marginally relevant, and pieces that use synonyms (e.g., fear of victimization) or are in German/English but clearly analyze the construct, which should still be considered relevant.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks analyses and best practices about higher education institutions (Hochschulen), especially in German-speaking contexts. Key interests include anti-discrimination and equality policies, accreditation and quality assurance, student selection and rankings, sustainability and regional engagement, innovation support, and inclusion measures for groups such as women, refugees, and students with children.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “hochschule” when it substantively addresses higher-education institutions (Universitäten, Hochschulen, Fachhochschulen) and their policies, practices, or roles, such as anti-discrimination frameworks on campus, student selection and rankings, sustainable regional engagement, continuing education, accreditation/quality management, or academic employment conditions. Analyses, case studies, or guidance aimed at university governance and services—e.g., discussions of complaint offices under the AGG, examples from Universität Augsburg or Hochschule Darmstadt, or initiatives for student parents or refugee integration—clearly match the query. By contrast, texts that only mention the word in passing, use it as part of a name (publisher, street, or organization), or discuss education without a higher-education context are non-relevant. Edge cases include pieces centered on women’s equality or innovation that are explicitly situated in universities (relevant) versus general labor-market or K–12 topics that merely drop the term once (non-relevant), and documents using synonyms like Universität or plural forms (Hochschulen), which should still be treated as relevant.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking comprehensive information and datasets on German higher education institutions, including surveys and time-series statistics on students, staff, governance, equality structures, digital learning, knowledge transfer, admissions, grading trends, and employer perceptions. They likely want sources such as HISTAT and DFG data handbooks that compile historical and contemporary data on universities and vocational schools across regions and time periods (including the former DDR).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it clearly concerns higher education institutions (Hochschulen) and related topics such as universities/Fachhochschulen, professors and students, governance, equality offices, digital teaching, admissions/selection, grading, or statistical time series about Hochschulen (e.g., HISTAT datasets on staff, funding, or student numbers). Concrete examples include surveys of Hochschullehrer on knowledge transfer, monitors of digital learning at the Hochschule, studies on grade inflation in university exams, or datasets distinguishing Universitäten, Technische Hochschulen, and Fachhochschulen. Material that only covers non-tertiary schooling (e.g., Berufsschulen) without a higher-education angle, or uses “Hochschule” merely in a name without substantive discussion of higher education, is non-relevant. Edge cases include DDR data that explicitly treat the Hochschulwesen (relevant), mixed documents that cover both Berufliche Schulen and Hochschulen (partly relevant if the higher-ed component is substantive), and content using synonyms/compounds like Universität, Uni, FH, Hochschulpolitik, or Hochschulzugang (relevant even without the exact keyword). Conversely, strings containing “hoch” or “schule” in unrelated compounds or geographic names, or generic tech/equipment mentions not tied to a Hochschule context, should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants to establish whether a person studied at a Hochschule (higher‑education institution/university) and to capture details of their higher‑education history — institution type (e.g., university, technical university, pedagogical college, engineering school, art or design academy), which schools were attended, and whether the studies were completed. They also need related facts: the highest degree obtained, any later schooling, the institution’s location (in Germany or which federal state), workplace/school location, and the commute distance.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "hochschule" when it explicitly discusses higher education institutions or activities related to them — for example mentions of Universität, Technische Hochschule, Fachhochschule, Pädagogische Hochschule, Kunstakademie, studying, degrees, or enrollment questions like "Haben Sie an einer Hochschule studiert?". Relevant texts often include survey items about attendance, completion of studies, highest university degree, location of the institution (Bundesland, Germany), or commute distance to the Hochschule. Documents are non-relevant if "Hochschule" appears only incidentally (e.g., as part of a company name), if the focus is solely on primary/secondary schools, or if the term is used in an unrelated idiomatic sense. Edge cases include compound words and related terms (Hochschulreife, Hochschulabschluss), common abbreviations (TH, PH), German-language vs. translated text, or listings of institutions that do not address attendance or degrees — these may be borderline and require checking context to decide relevance.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks information on higher-education (Hochschule) resources, particularly university-affiliated research projects and validated measurement instruments for assessing digital readiness, study demands, dropout risk, and training quality. They want tools applicable to students, educators, and related professional training programs in German-speaking institutions.</desc>
	<narr>This paragraph is highly relevant to the query “hochschule” because it repeatedly references higher education settings and institutions, including explicit mentions of Hochschulen and named entities like Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hochschule der Sächsischen Polizei, and the Duale Hochschule Baden-Württemberg (DHBW). It describes instruments and studies conducted in university contexts, such as the IDR‑24 for teachers and learners at Hochschulen, a study-requirements scale validated across four Hochschulen, and a dropout-risk measure for dual-study students at DHBW. Even sections on hand hygiene and internet-enabled pharmaceutical crime remain relevant because they are framed as projects run by Hochschulen or in cooperation with universities. An edge case is the firefighter training instrument, which is less directly academic but still touches higher education via scales adapted from Lehrevaluation an Hochschulen. A document would be non-relevant if it discussed only general schools, hospitals, or public safety without any link to Hochschulen, or if it mentioned only “Universität” and an exact-match search required the keyword “Hochschule.”</narr>

<title>politische partizipation</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks a comprehensive overview of political participation—its definitions, functions, forms (conventional, unconventional, online), measurement, and theoretical foundations—along with empirical evidence from Germany. They want determinants and disparities across groups (education, gender, age, religiosity, social capital, media use, migration, disability), East–West differences, and trends over time, often using ALLBUS data.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it defines, theorizes, measures, or empirically analyzes political participation as citizen involvement in democratic will-formation and decision-making, covering forms such as voting, contacting officials, working in organizations, petitions, demonstrations, boycotts, or online participation. Especially relevant are studies of determinants and contexts—e.g., religiosity (practice vs denomination), political knowledge types, social capital and networks, media use (TV vs internet), institutional multilevel settings, and group differences by region (East/West Germany), gender, age, education, migration background, disability, or youth—ideally using survey data like ALLBUS (1992, 1998, 2008, 2018). Methodological contributions that operationalize participation (intentions vs manifested behavior), compare cross-sectional and panel models, or map dimensions and typologies of participants also qualify. Non-relevant are texts that use “Partizipation” in non-political domains (e.g., classroom or social work participation) or describe general volunteering without linking it to political influence on policy or representation. Edge cases: normative essays count if they situate participation within democratic theory or functions (intermediation, socialization, legitimacy), and digital participation pieces are pertinent when they distinguish meaningful engagement from “pseudo-participation” and tie it to political outcomes.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks survey datasets and studies on political participation, interest, and civic engagement—primarily in Germany—including ALLBUS/ISSP modules, SOEP-based analyses, and local urban renewal case studies, with rich measures (protest, political culture, media use, social capital) and demographics. The goal is to analyze determinants, patterns, and trends in participation across different populations and contexts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly treats political participation (politische Partizipation) as behavior, attitudes, or measures—such as voting, protest/demonstrations, civic/petition activity, membership, political interest, efficacy, and engagement scales—and examines determinants or contexts of these activities. Survey-based descriptions and study reports are highly relevant when they include participation modules or indices (e.g., ALLBUS/ISSP items on conventional and unconventional participation, political alienation, media use, political knowledge, trust) or analyze participation in local contexts like urban renewal cases in Cologne/Oberhausen/Wuppertal or Andernach. Content on political education is also in scope if it links information sources, event attendance, or readiness to participate to political engagement; youth studies discussing protest participation, left–right self-placement, party ID, and participation indices likewise qualify. Non-relevant material includes texts that only list demographics without analyzing participation, or that use “Partizipation” in non-political domains (workplace, school) unless explicitly tied to political involvement; generic program overviews that mention participation but provide no measures or findings are borderline. Edge cases include cross-national gender-representation surveys that measure political participation (relevant) and documents where “participation” appears in long topic lists—these should be included only if they contain concrete indicators or analyses of political participation.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants to understand citizens' political participation and related attitudes — especially public opinions on the political course of parties (CDU/CSU, SPD, Greens), support for inter-party cooperation, views on the EU’s future, comparisons of political conditions since the DDR, and tolerance toward political opponents — likely to design or interpret survey questions measuring political engagement and party preferences.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "politische Partizipation" when it directly addresses how citizens engage in politics — for example descriptions or measures of voting, party membership, protests, petitions, contacting officials, civic volunteering, or willingness to participate asked in surveys. Texts that only discuss party strategy or ideological shifts (e.g., whether the CDU is moving left, or whether the SPD’s course prevailed in coalition talks) are not relevant by themselves, because they focus on party positions rather than citizen engagement. Borderline cases include pieces on political attitudes or tolerance: these do not count as participation per se but can be relevant if they are analyzed as predictors of participatory behavior. Historical or institutional discussions (e.g., political conditions in the former DDR or EU governance changes) are relevant only when they explicitly link those contexts to changes in participation rates or opportunities. Finally, relevant documents often contain concrete indicators or survey items (e.g., “Did you vote?” “Have you attended a protest?” “Would you join a citizens’ initiative?”) rather than just general commentary about politics.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks surveys, scales, and pretested questionnaire items that measure political participation and related attitudes (e.g., efficacy, cynicism, engagement), along with methodological details. They want German/European sources such as ALLBUS, ESS, and CSES, including question wording, validation, and cognitive pretest results.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “politische partizipation” if it directly measures, analyzes, or describes citizens’ participatory behaviors or capacities (e.g., voting, campaigning, political engagement, or political efficacy as a precursor to participation). Clear positives here include ALLBUS waves when the theme is Political Participation, the DDR project on political engagement, SOWI instruments that include Politisches Engagement, the Trier scales that cover political and environmental engagement, PEKS (political efficacy), RISS items on efficacy for political life, and CSES content when it includes turnout or contact behavior. Materials focused mainly on attitudes (immigration, antisemitism, national pride, conservatism, political cynicism) are only relevant if they explicitly link those attitudes to participation outcomes; otherwise they are non-relevant. Methodological pretests are relevant only when the pretested items concern participation (not, for example, purely asylum, climate, or gender-equality attitudes), and broad surveys like ESS/ALLBUS count only for modules that actually cover participation. Edge cases include “Digitale Partizipation” within the IDR 24 (likely about participation in digital learning, not political participation) and projects on inflation expectations or social networks during COVID, which are non-relevant unless they measure political engagement behaviors.</narr>

They want cross-national evidence on how these factors shape private and public actions, activism, policy support, and environmental justice.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively examines environmental topics—such as ecology, sustainability, climate change, pollution, conservation—or the social, behavioral, and policy dimensions of these issues. Examples include studies of environmental concern and pro-environmental behavior, analyses of environmental governance and collective action, discussions of environmental justice or refugees, assessments of environmental monitoring, and work on green purchasing or information sources that shape environmental actions. A document is non-relevant if “environmental” appears only in passing or in a different sense, e.g., business “environmental scanning” (market context), software “environment variables,” or generic mentions of an experimental environment without ecological implications. Edge cases like trade-and-environment, environmental security, or demographic moderators (age, wealth, education) are relevant when they explicitly link to environmental impacts, policies, or behaviors. Conversely, pieces where “environmental” is present only in an organization’s name or as a historical aside without substantive environmental analysis would not meet the query’s intent.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking comprehensive survey data on environmental awareness and behavior—primarily in Germany—including attitudes toward environmental protection, consumption and mobility habits, climate and energy policy preferences, and consumer protection. They also want methodological details, demographic variables, time‑series context, and coverage of recent waves such as the 2024 study.</desc>
	<narr>For the query “environmental,” a document is relevant when it substantively addresses environmental awareness, conditions, policy, or behavior—such as surveys on attitudes to pollution and climate change, measures of conduct harmful to the environment, perceived noise and air/water pollution, willingness to pay for eco-friendly products, waste separation, eco labels, and energy or mobility transitions (e.g., the Energiewende). The paragraph is highly relevant because it details repeated German survey programs on environmental consciousness, including scales on attitudes and behaviors, assessments of environmental quality at local, national, and global levels, readiness to change lifestyles, and policy preferences on taxes, traffic, agriculture, and climate. Content that is only tangential—consumer protection or political participation without an environmental link, demographic fields, or survey logistics—is peripheral and not directly responsive unless tied back to environmental outcomes. Edge cases include documents using “environmental” in unrelated senses (e.g., business or software environments) or only name-dropping the term; these would be non-relevant, whereas historical or regional angles (e.g., GDR comparisons, EU agricultural policy) remain relevant if they analyze environmental protection or impacts. Similarly, sections on vocational training or MMM tasks are non-relevant unless they explicitly connect to environmental attitudes or behaviors.</narr>

The user is likely seeking or designing survey questions and/or analyzing public attitudes and trust related to environmental information and policy trade-offs.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "environmental" if it contains substantive content about environmental topics — for example questions or text contrasting environmental problems vs solutions, attitudes toward environmental protection versus economic competitiveness, or which actors (scientists, governments, media, family, companies, NGOs) people trust on environmental issues. Short excerpts of survey items that explicitly ask “Do you know more about environmental problems or solutions?” or list trust options (scientists, newspapers, EU, companies, etc.) are clearly relevant because they address public knowledge, preferences and trust related to the environment. Documents are non‑relevant when they lack any environment-specific content (e.g., unrelated survey modules, generic metadata codes, or text about non‑environmental domains like health or education) or when the word “environmental” appears only as an attribute with no contextual meaning. Edge cases include code‑only records (e.g., Q48, Q45) which may be relevant if you can map the codes to survey questions, noisy/repeated transcriptions that are topically relevant but low quality, and ambiguous uses of “protection” or “problems” that refer to non‑environmental contexts.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks an overview of environmental psychology measurement scales—especially environmental efficacy—detailing what they assess (awareness, norms, coping styles, behaviors), their structure, and psychometric quality. They also want information on cross-cultural reliability and measurement invariance (e.g., ISSP 2020) to identify validated tools for assessing pro-environmental attitudes and behavior.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “environmental” when it substantively discusses environmental topics such as ecological impacts, pro-environmental behavior, environmental attitudes or efficacy, chemical exposures, policies, or tools for measuring these constructs. For example, texts detailing pro-environmental efficacy, ISSP environmental modules, scales of environmental awareness and coping styles, littering norms, or psychometric results (e.g., reliabilities, cross-cultural invariance) are clearly on-topic. It is non-relevant if “environmental” appears only in unrelated contexts—like computer “environment variables,” software “test environments,” or generic “work environment” discussions—without ecological content. Edge cases that should still count as relevant include methodological or clinical pieces (e.g., measurement invariance analyses of environmental attitudes, or idiopathic environmental intolerance linked to environmental chemicals) because the focal constructs are environmental. Conversely, occurrences limited to organization names, citations, or boilerplate with no substantive environmental discussion should be considered non-relevant.</narr>

Specifically, they want to understand how macroeconomic conditions, individual characteristics (e.g., religion, age, class), cultural/regime contexts, taxation, migration, and globalization shape support for government responsibility, deservingness views, and policy/political outcomes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it examines social welfare as public assistance or the welfare state—such as attitudes toward government responsibility, welfare regime models, funding and taxation, fraud and deservingness, or how macroeconomic conditions, religion, migration, or FDI shape welfare policy and opinions. Empirical studies using surveys like WVS/EVS/ISSP, cross-national comparisons of liberal vs social-democratic regimes, and country cases (e.g., Sweden, Netherlands, Australia, China, Korea) are strong matches because they directly analyze welfare systems and politics. Theory pieces that define or critique welfare regimes (e.g., Esping-Andersen frameworks, Confucian welfare cluster) or debate reform concepts like activation, rights/responsibilities, and workfare also count as relevant. Documents become less relevant when “welfare” means generic well-being, employee benefits, or animal welfare, or when it’s a passing mention not tied to social policy, redistribution, or public programs; welfare economics focused only on abstract social welfare functions without policy implications is borderline. Edge cases include religious or civil-society “welfare” provision and welfare crime/fraud—these remain relevant if they concern the administration, legitimacy, or outcomes of the welfare state.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks empirical data and studies on welfare in Germany, including profiles of recipients, evaluations of youth welfare institutions, and public attitudes toward the welfare state and social justice. They also want analyses of conflicts among welfare workers and longitudinal social indicators tracking welfare and quality of life (1950–2013).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it addresses public welfare/social assistance systems, their recipients, administration, and outcomes—for example, profiles of aid recipients (age, marital status, nationality), reasons for granting aid, duration and amount of benefits, or the role and evaluation of Youth Welfare Committees and departments. Materials that measure welfare broadly—such as social indicator systems tracking life satisfaction, income, health, social isolation, or other quality-of-life metrics over time—also count as relevant. Studies of organizations serving welfare clients (e.g., Caritas) that detail clients’ income, housing, unemployment benefits, support payments, experiences with authorities, and pathways into or out of welfare are clearly on-topic. Edge cases include texts on “welfare workers” and workplace conflict: these are only marginally relevant unless they explicitly link to public welfare service delivery; theoretical “welfare economics” or “well-being” pieces are relevant if they operationalize or assess social welfare, but not if they use the term loosely. Non-relevant documents would use “welfare” in unrelated senses (animal welfare, corporate employee welfare, police welfare checks) or discuss general socioeconomics without any substantive tie to welfare policy, benefits, or welfare-state institutions.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for survey items and measures about "welfare," specifically public attitudes toward social welfare systems (coverage, cost, exemplar status, and expectations for 2030) and farm animal welfare (importance, definitions, and whether buying welfare-friendly products helps). They likely need concise question wording or a set of standardized survey questions capturing these topics.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "welfare" when it substantively discusses welfare topics such as social welfare systems (coverage, cost, future outlook), animal welfare (farm animal protection, welfare-friendly products), or public attitudes and behaviors toward welfare policies. The pasted paragraph contains many survey items about national and community social welfare systems and questions about the importance of farm animal welfare and purchasing welfare‑friendly products, so those passages are clearly relevant. Documents that merely include the word "welfare" as a code fragment, in repeated metadata lines, or as a company/product name without substantive discussion are not relevant. Edge cases include narrowly focused documents — for example, a study only about consumer purchasing of welfare‑friendly products is highly relevant for animal‑welfare intent but less so for someone researching social welfare policy, and texts that use similar words (wellbeing, welfare check) may be ambiguous without context. To resolve ambiguity, prefer documents with full question text, explanatory context, or topic tags indicating "social policy" or "animal welfare."</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it discusses the welfare state, public assistance or social services, or empirically examines attitudes toward welfare policies and distribution principles such as need, equality, and merit. Studies that validate scales measuring welfare attitudes (e.g., factor analyses, correlations with empathy or belief in a just world) or compare views across social contexts like work, welfare, and friendship are strongly relevant, even if they focus on measurement rather than program details. Content about policy debates, welfare reform, benefit eligibility, or public perceptions of welfare recipients also counts, including synonyms like social assistance, safety net, means-tested benefits, or programs like TANF. Non-relevant items use “welfare” to mean general well-being, animal welfare, player/employee welfare, or child welfare unrelated to state benefits, or purely theoretical “welfare economics” without linkage to social policy. Edge cases include “corporate welfare” (often relevant if tied to state subsidies) and historical or cross-national discussions that don’t say “welfare” explicitly but clearly address welfare-state services.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively discusses refugees (Flüchtling) in German, including definitions, legal status, lived experiences, public attitudes, or policies, and uses the term itself or its morphological/compound forms (e.g., Flüchtlinge, Flüchtlingspolitik, Flüchtlingsunterkünfte). Strong examples include theoretical debates about who counts as a Flüchtling versus migrant or Asylbewerber, empirical studies on housing, integration, education or labor market outcomes, surveys like ALLBUS on attitudes, or case studies such as Eritrean refugees in Tel Aviv or Syrian refugees in Jordan, as well as historical discussions of “echte Flüchtlinge.” Documents that address migration generally without linking to refugees, focus exclusively on other categories (e.g., only Binnenvertriebene or labor migrants), or only mention the word in passing without analysis, are less relevant. Edge cases: texts analyzing the discursive construction of “Flüchtling,” or using compounds and inflected forms, are relevant; pieces focused solely on “Flucht” (flight) without designating persons as Flüchtlinge, or metaphorical/proper-name uses of “Flüchtling,” should be treated as peripheral. Spelling variants (Fluechtling, missing umlaut), capitalization differences, and historical/regional subsets (DDR-Flüchtlinge, palästinensische Flüchtlinge) remain relevant when the subject is refugees.</narr>

They also seek insights on volunteer engagement, expectations of government, related political opinions, and demographic breakdowns.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly discusses refugees/asylum seekers or refugee policy, including compound and plural forms such as “Flüchtlinge,” “Flüchtlingspolitik,” “Flüchtlingshilfe,” or related terms like “Asyl,” and covers themes like German/EU asylum policy, the impacts of refugee inflows, and personal engagement with refugees. Strong signals include content on neighborhood experiences with refugees, perceived effects (crime, meeting skilled labor demand, cultural enrichment, demographic change, financial strain), expectations of return, and concrete volunteering actions (donations, hosting, language tutoring, supporting shelters). Political or social-cohesion materials are relevant when they link elections, party preferences, or community cohesion directly to refugee topics (e.g., views on Merkel’s refugee policy, EU reform, acceptance of local refugee housing); similar content without a refugee component is non-relevant. Broad migration/diversity or integration discussions are only relevant if refugees/Asylbewerber are explicitly addressed rather than immigration in general. Edge cases include historical DDR refugees (still relevant), and datasets where “Flüchtling” appears only in variable lists or passing mentions—these are weakly relevant unless the substantive focus centers on refugees.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for information about refugees ("Flüchtlinge") in Germany, particularly public attitudes and survey questions about integration, crime concerns, and whether refugees will be successfully integrated. They also want details on legal/status distinctions (refugee vs. Heimatvertriebener), political responses (e.g., CDU/CSU), and EU burden-sharing for migrants arriving in countries like Italy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "Flüchtling" if it substantively discusses refugees or displaced persons — for example news or analysis about refugees from North Africa arriving in Italy, EU rules on which country must take asylum seekers, German debates about integration, surveys asking “Wird es gelingen die Flüchtlinge bei uns…”, or questions about origin country, asylum policy, and crime perceptions. Short question texts, opinion-polls, legal texts about asylum responsibility, and reports on “Heimatvertriebene” (expellees/displaced persons) are also relevant because they address the same subject matter. Documents are non-relevant if they only contain the token “Flüchtling” as noise or duplication, are purely metadata or lists with no substantive content, or use similar words in a different sense (e.g., the adjective “flüchtig,” an animal fleeing, or a person’s surname). Edge cases include historical material on Heimatvertriebene (related but distinct from contemporary asylum issues), very short survey snippets or repeated keyword dumps (contain the term but offer little usable information), and documents in other languages — which can be relevant if they meaningfully discuss refugees but less useful if they lack context.</narr>

	<desc>The user is looking for information about refugees (Flüchtlinge), specifically research on improving healthcare and service structures for asylum seekers — in this case the RESPOND project at Heidelberg University Hospital, its goals to create evidence for more effective, efficient, and needs-based care, and the methods used (cognitive interviews in multiple languages with remote simultaneous interpreters).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "Flüchtling" if it directly discusses refugees or asylum seekers (German: Flüchtlinge/Asylsuchende), their legal status, access to services (healthcare, housing, education), or policies and research aimed at improving their care. For example, the RESPOND paragraph is relevant because it explicitly targets Asylsuchende and describes a research project testing interview materials in multiple languages to improve healthcare provision. A document that only mentions migration broadly, tourists, or uses the string "flüchtig" in an unrelated sense would be non‑relevant, and reports that aggregate migrants without separating refugees may be only partially relevant. Edge cases include texts that use synonyms or foreign-language equivalents (refugee, refugiado, Schutzsuchende), studies of internally displaced persons or mixed-migrant flows (which can be relevant depending on scope), and methodological papers that include refugees as a minor subgroup rather than the main focus.</narr>

They want evidence on innovations (nature-integrated and digital/self-guided therapies), factors that influence outcomes and therapist/patient preferences, and broader social contexts shaping psychotherapy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it primarily addresses psychotherapy—its practices, modalities, outcomes, settings, or professionals—such as surveys of nature-integrating psychotherapy, studies linking psychotherapy to institutional trust after GDR repression, or trials of self-guided internet-based therapy for depression. Empirical work (RCTs, naturalistic effectiveness studies, qualitative case studies), theoretical frameworks, book reviews, and critiques that analyze psychotherapy as a discipline (e.g., positive psychotherapy, digital transformation of care, therapist preference predictors) are also relevant. Documents focusing on adjacent domains like counseling or coaching can be relevant when explicitly situated within psychotherapeutic theory or clinical practice, but pieces where “psychotherapy” is only a passing mention, a journal header without substantive psychotherapeutic content, or discussions of non-mental-health “therapy” would be non-relevant. Edge cases include studies where psychotherapy is a predictor rather than the main topic (still relevant if it analyzes psychotherapy use or effects) and multilingual variants: German “Psychotherapie,” “psychotherapeutisch,” and English “psychotherapy/psychotherapist” all count. Content on specific populations (infants/toddlers in parent–child therapy, adolescents, outpatient practice) and diverse orientations (psychodynamic, humanistic, systemic, behavioral) strengthens relevance.</narr>

	<desc>Seeks survey-based information on psychotherapy among Freiburg physicians, focusing on doctors’ attitudes toward psychotherapy and related treatment patterns within the broader context of their professional characteristics, patient mix, and continuing education.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly discusses psychotherapy—its use, attitudes toward it, training, policies, or how physicians engage with it—such as a survey that measures doctors’ “attitude to psychotherapy” or their participation in psychotherapy-related continuing education. Content about mental health treatment modalities, referrals to psychotherapists, or the prevalence of psychological illnesses connected to therapeutic approaches also counts. It is not relevant if it only covers doctors’ economic conditions, administrative workload, demographics, or medication prescribing without addressing psychotherapy itself, and terms like psychology or psychosomatic issues alone do not guarantee relevance. Edge cases include long lists where “psychotherapy” appears as one item (still relevant but shallow), language or morphological variants (Psychotherapie, psychotherapeutisch, Psychotherapeut), and potential false positives like physiotherapy or psychopharmacology mentions that lack a psychotherapeutic component. For example, this survey text is relevant because it directly includes “attitude to psychotherapy,” even though many other topics are listed.</narr>

	<desc>The user wants a clear, concise explanation of psychotherapy—what it is, how it works, and when it’s used—plus basic information about common approaches (e.g., CBT, psychodynamic), expected outcomes, and how to find or access a therapist.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "psychotherapie" if its main topic is psychotherapy—definitions, treatment methods (CBT, psychodynamic, humanistic, etc.), clinical evidence, indications, provider qualifications, access and insurance issues, or practical guidance for patients and clinicians. Highly relevant examples include clinical guidelines on psychotherapy for depression, research studies on therapeutic effectiveness, directories of licensed psychotherapists, and patient information pages explaining what psychotherapy entails. Non-relevant documents mention the word only peripherally (e.g., a news article that fleetingly references psychotherapy), focus on unrelated "therapy" topics (physical therapy, machine learning "therapy" metaphors), or use the term in a purely bibliographic list with no substantive content. Edge cases include pages about psychotherapy training, regulation, or accreditation (potentially relevant depending on intent), documents in other languages that nevertheless use the exact term "psychotherapie" (more relevant than generic translations), and compound or specialized terms (e.g., "Kunsttherapie" or "Psychotherapieforschung") which may be partially relevant depending on whether the user seeks general psychotherapy information or a specific subtopic.</narr>

They likely want to know what each tool measures, how it’s structured and validated, and how it’s used clinically for screening, differential diagnosis, and treatment planning.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "psychotherapie" if it discusses psychotherapeutic assessment, diagnosis, treatment planning, referral to therapy, intervention methods, or outcome monitoring — for example descriptions of instruments used to identify patients who need psychotherapy or to track symptom change during therapy. Psychometric descriptions become clearly relevant when they are tied to clinical decisions: the Whiteley Index’s use to detect hypochondriacal beliefs for referral to specialized treatment or the PSWQ’s role in identifying excessive worry as a target for CBT are directly pertinent. By contrast, purely technical validation studies, isolated scale item lists, or descriptions of somatic-sensory questionnaires that do not link findings to therapeutic action are less relevant. Edge cases include German-language instrument manuals (language does not reduce relevance), preventive screening tools that recommend interventions (relevant), and historical DSM citations that affect diagnostic criteria used in therapy (relevant), whereas instruments presented only for research or psychometric benchmarking without clinical application are borderline or non-relevant.</narr>

<publication>
	<desc>Find scholarly research on family dynamics, strengths, functioning, and policy—including work–family conflict, socioeconomic and cultural influences, and pandemic effects—and how these factors relate to well-being, child outcomes, and fertility across countries.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if “family” is its core subject—e.g., it analyzes family relationships, functioning, or well-being, treats the family as a unit of analysis, or evaluates family-focused policy. Studies measuring family constructs such as commitment, communication, cohesion, coping, and competence, or topics like family climate during COVID-19, fathers’ work–family conflict, or meta-analyses linking family strengths to personal and family outcomes are clearly relevant. Policy and cross-cultural work that examines family roles, intergenerational care, fertility, or the institutional status of families (for example, Slovak family policy, Mediterranean caregiving, or trends in Swedish family change) are also relevant. Edge cases include medical or genetic studies of “familial” conditions or “family aggregation”: they are relevant only when they address family dynamics, caregiving, or household impacts, but not when they focus solely on biological inheritance; likewise, workplace research is relevant if it links to family outcomes but not if “family” is merely mentioned. Non-relevant items use “family” in a different sense (taxonomic family, “family of models/products”) or only in a title, venue, or affiliation without substantive analysis of families.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks survey-based datasets and analyses on family structures and dynamics—including multigenerational living, caregiving and financial support, custody models, celebrations, and intergenerational ties—and their links to health care use, employment and gender roles, and policy. They want methodological details and demographic coverage across countries and time.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it examines “family” as a social unit—structures, relationships, roles, support and care, custody arrangements, intergenerational ties, or family-related policies and wellbeing. Examples include surveys on post-separation family models and joint custody, household composition and caregiving, attitudes to marriage and childrearing, kinship networks (e.g., KINMATRIX), and studies linking family circumstances to outcomes (such as childcare, financial support, or media use). Partially relevant items treat “family” as a significant subtheme in other domains—healthcare (family doctor, relatives in need of care), economics (family businesses, remittances), or education—when they analyze impacts on or practices within families rather than merely naming them. Non-relevant material uses “family” only as a label detached from human kinship (e.g., product families, mathematical families) or contains only incidental mentions with no substantive discussion. Edge cases: historical genealogy tables are relevant if they map relationships across generations; a study on internet use is relevant when it explicitly ties trajectories to family context but not if it reports usage trends without familial factors.</narr>

Also identify related variables on how you or a family member received clinical infection risk information (doctor, hospital staff, TV, internet, radio, brochures, NGOs, etc.).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "family" when it explicitly concerns households or household members — for example, statements about family income (monthly income, income per family member, income quartiles), family type and roles (changing roles of husband and wife, which family model one prefers), or living arrangements described as "detached family house" or multi-family housing. Items that list survey questions or answers like "you or a member of your family received this information" or variables named RU_INC09 / BG_INC etc. are also highly relevant because they directly encode household-level information. A document is non-relevant when "family" appears only incidentally (e.g., in a company name, a biological "family" of viruses, or a single isolated token) or when only opaque technical codes are present without human-readable family content. Edge cases include records that mix relevant family labels with repetitive metadata or code lists: if readable labels or context (income amounts, role descriptions, housing types) are present the document should be considered relevant, but if it contains only numeric codes or duplicated lines with no explanatory text it may be borderline or require codebook lookup. Overall, the more distinct family-related fields and human-readable descriptions a document contains, the higher its relevance.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively examines family as a social unit or construct—e.g., measures of work–family conflict, family climate, parenting/religiosity, educational aspirations shaped by families of origin, or microcensus-derived variables that define households, families, and living arrangements and show how to reconstruct them (SPSS/STATA). Content that operationalizes or analyzes family-level variables (such as “Family and Changing Gender Roles” modules or scales on justice in the family) is directly on point, as are studies using family-of-origin information (e.g., books in the family home) to explain outcomes. Material in German using “Familie” and “Haushalt” is also relevant when it enables family-level analysis, with “household” counting when it is explicitly tied to family relationships or life-forms. By contrast, pieces that only mention family in passing (e.g., national pride stabilizing family structures) or use “family” metaphorically (“family of products,” “family name”) are non-relevant. Edge cases include datasets focused on labor market or general households: they are relevant only if they provide identifiers or variables that reconstruct or analyze family units, otherwise they are borderline.</narr>

They want theoretical and empirical perspectives including environmental ethics and rights of nature, feminist care critiques, ANT, and studies of nature perception.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively discusses “Natur” (nature) as a concept or domain—e.g., treatments of zweite Natur/second nature, the nature–culture (Natur–Kultur) distinction, environmental ethics (Naturethik), perceptions of nature (Naturwahrnehmung), or legal/moral debates such as rights of nature—especially when “Natur” appears in German compounds like Naturwissenschaft(en), Naturverhältnisse, or Naturverständnis. It also counts when “Natur” is central to sociological, philosophical, feminist, or ecological analyses, such as studies of park landscapes, Gaia, or societal constructions of nature, rather than being a passing mention. Borderline cases include technical compounds where “Natur” is present but the focus is not nature itself (e.g., a brief nod to Naturwissenschaften in a purely methodological piece). Non-relevant hits are those where “natur” occurs only as a substring or filler (natürlich = “of course”), in unrelated English phrases like natural numbers or natural language, or in proper names/brands/journals (“Nature”) without thematic engagement with nature. Spelling variants and plurals (Naturen, naturnah, Naturbegriff) should be treated as relevant when they point to substantive discussion, not mere incidental usage.</narr>

<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking surveys and studies about “nature,” specifically German public attitudes and behaviors regarding nature and biodiversity, conservation, nature-friendly consumption, urban and agricultural landscapes, and landscape changes from the energy transition, including measurement scales, motivations, and demographic correlates.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it addresses “Natur” in the environmental or ecological sense—e.g., attitudes toward nature, nature experience, biodiversity, conservation (Naturschutz), urban nature (Stadtnatur), protected areas (Nationalparks, Natura 2000), agriculture’s impacts on nature, or landscape changes from the energy transition. German compound terms containing “Natur” such as Naturerleben, Naturschutz, Naturverträglichkeit, Naturpark, or biologische Vielfalt count as strong signals, as do survey instruments measuring responsibility for nature, frequency of time spent in nature (forest, parks, rivers), or willingness to engage in conservation. Content about nature-friendly consumption (Bio, regional/seasonal products, Naturkosmetik when tied to environmental impact) and policy/evaluation items (wildness areas, species protection, land-use, Gentechnik in agriculture) are also in scope. Non-relevant are uses where “natur” appears only tangentially or idiomatically (e.g., “the nature of a problem,” media lists that merely mention “Natur- und Tierfilme,” or topics like TV ratings, general religion, or politics without a substantive link to environmental nature). Edge cases include “Naturwissenschaft(en)” or “menschliche Natur”: these are only relevant if explicitly connected to environmental preservation or human–nature relations rather than science education or philosophical discussion.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A concise survey information need: assess respondents’ beliefs about nature (e.g., whether “nature is sacred” and support for protecting the environment) and how important environmental goals are for societal development. Also map those answers to a coding scheme of political perception levels (01 ideologue through 09 no-issue-content, 99 not asked).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "natur" when it explicitly addresses nature or environmental protection — for example texts that ask about "Schutz von Natur und Umwelt," survey items asking respondents to rate the importance of nature for societal development, or coding schemes that classify political attitudes toward environmental issues. Documents that include the survey scale, response options, or the listed variable codes (01–09) are especially pertinent because they show the content is about public attitudes and political perception of nature. Non-relevant documents merely containing the substring "natur" (e.g., in unrelated words like "international" or brand names) or using "natur" metaphorically without environmental meaning (e.g., "human nature" in a philosophical sense) should be deprioritized. Edge cases include texts in German versus English (German-language items such as "Schutz von Natur" are highly relevant), partial repeats or duplicated question blocks (which are relevant but signal redundancy), and documents that discuss economic or political decisions without any link to environmental consequences (which may be only tangentially relevant).</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user seeks information on how “nature” is conceptualized and measured in environmental attitude research, especially within the General Environmental Awareness scale. They want the distinctions between intrinsic and instrumental understandings of nature and “nature as a basis of existence,” and how these subscales are operationalized.</desc>
	<narr>This document is largely relevant to the query “natur” because it explicitly discusses environmental worldview, with subscales like intrinsic and instrumental “Naturverständnis” and “Natur als Existenzgrundlage.” It also contains other uses of “Natur,” such as “menschliche Natur” (human nature) and in “Naturwissenschaften” (natural sciences), which match the keyword but may be tangential if the intent is specifically environmental nature. The mention of “Nature Human Behaviour” refers to the journal title and is only relevant if the query targets the publication “Nature,” otherwise it is a false positive. Content on Machiavellianism, conservatism, and the crystalline intelligence short scale is generally non-relevant unless the user seeks links between these constructs and concepts of nature. Edge cases include substring and case-insensitive matches (e.g., “natur” hitting “Natur,” “Nature,” or compounds), and the German-language context may or may not fit an English “nature” intent.</narr>

	<desc>Seeks a comprehensive overview of Turkey’s relationship with the EU and its evolving geopolitical role. Focus areas include migration dynamics and the refugee crisis, energy security strategy, democratization and minority rights, European public attitudes, and the implications for EU accession and cooperation.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “turkey” when it clearly concerns the country—its migration patterns with the EU, accession politics, energy geopolitics, foreign policy, human rights, or domestic policy—using terms like EU-Turkey relations, Turkish migration, Ankara, or pipelines through the Bosporus. The provided paragraph is strongly relevant because it analyzes EU–Turkey migration (emigration/immigration, readmission), public attitudes toward Turkey’s EU bid, humanitarian policy for Syrian refugees, energy hub dynamics (BTC/BTE), climate strategy, minority rights under the Copenhagen criteria, and broader foreign and security ties. Documents about “turkey” as poultry (recipes, hunting, Thanksgiving), the slang sense of “a turkey” meaning a failure, or pieces that only name Turkey in passing without substantive discussion are non-relevant. Edge cases include comparative EU studies that mention Turkey briefly, items using “Türkiye,” “Turkish,” or “Anatolia” instead of “Turkey,” and datasets listing Turkey among many countries; these are relevant only if they provide meaningful, specific information about the state rather than incidental mentions.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks research and survey data related to Turkey, especially on Turkish migration and integration in Europe (notably Germany), identity, language, and discrimination. They also want public opinion datasets on Turkey’s potential EU membership and broader foreign policy perceptions involving Turkey.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “turkey” when it centers on the country Turkey or Turkish people, for example studies of Turks in Europe, surveys on migration to and from Turkey, or public opinion about Turkey’s potential EU membership, NATO, or foreign policy. Content about Turkish identity, language use, religion, discrimination, remittances, and attachment to Turkey, as well as references to Turkish cities (Ankara, Istanbul), demonyms (Turkish, Turk), or the country code TR that clearly indicate the state, also qualifies. Broad comparative surveys that devote specific questions or sections to Turkey (e.g., attitudes toward Turkish EU accession or views of Turkey among Europeans) are relevant, while lists that merely name Turkey among many countries without substantive discussion are only weakly relevant. Documents about “turkey” the bird, recipes, Thanksgiving, or a person/company named Turkey are non-relevant. Variants like Türkiye or references to Turkish parties, elections, or diaspora communities support relevance when they clearly pertain to the country.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>A search for survey questions and variable codes about public opinion in Turkey on EU accession — specifically whether people would favour Turkey joining the EU (once conditions are met), perceived obstacles (standards, democracy, human rights, economy, corruption, reconciliation, etc.), and related items like party attachment and regional identifiers. The query appears to target specific survey variables and datasets (ISSP/Eurobarometer, ZA/ v/Q codes) that record Turkish responses and regional breakdowns.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "turkey" when it substantively discusses the country Turkey — for example public opinion about Turkey’s EU accession, survey items on favourability (QD15, Q37, Q58, etc.), party attachment in Turkey, or dataset notes (ISSP ZA4950/ZA7570) that report Turkish responses. Short lists of variable names or question codes that clearly refer to Turkish modules or to Turkey-specific questions are relevant because they signal content about Turkey’s membership prospects, reforms (human rights, democracy, standards), or regional treatment (Western Balkans and Turkey). A document is non-relevant when "turkey" refers to the bird, a recipe, a company name, or appears only incidentally (e.g., a long list of country names where Turkey is mentioned but not discussed), or when the main topic is unrelated despite containing a TR country code. Edge cases include texts that use alternative spellings (Türkiye), documents in another language that nevertheless focus on Turkey’s accession, or files that contain only raw dataset codes without question text — these may be borderline and should be judged by whether substantive Turkey-specific content (questions, responses, or analysis) is present.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is seeking information about "turkey," an ambiguous term that could refer to the country Turkey, the bird (or its meat/dishes), or related topics like travel, history, recipes, or nutrition. They likely want concise facts, definitions, or practical guidance depending on which sense of the word they mean.</desc>
	<narr>The single-word query "turkey" is ambiguous, so a relevant document clearly matches the intended sense — for example, a recipe describing roasting a turkey (including details like oven temperature and cooking time), an ornithology paper on Meleagris (wild or domesticated turkeys), or a travel advisory, history, or news piece about the country Turkey (capital Ankara, geopolitical coverage). Non-relevant documents either only mention "turkey" in passing or use unrelated senses or idioms (e.g., a sports article about a "turkey" in bowling, the phrase "turkey shoot," or an article about turkey vultures) that don’t match the user’s intent. Edge cases include documents using different spellings or languages (Türkiye, Turquía) that are still relevant to the country, pages about vegan substitutes like "tofurkey" which are only tangentially relevant to the bird, and scientific texts that use Latin names — these should be judged relevant if the surrounding context aligns with the user’s likely meaning. Finally, relevance depends on prominence and specificity: a page devoted to turkey topics is more relevant than a long article where "turkey" appears once without substantive information.</narr>

They also want evidence on trust’s consequences for cooperation and policy-relevant attitudes (e.g., toward government, media, regulation, tax morale) and whether trust is declining over time.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it centers on trust as a social, political, organizational, or psychological construct—defining it, theorizing its processes, or measuring it (for example, studies on generalized vs. particularized trust, intergenerational transmission among immigrants, or how cultural factors like long-term orientation shape trust). Empirical works that model institutional or domain-specific trust—trust in media, government, EU institutions, regulatory agencies, or management during organizational change—and papers linking trust to outcomes such as cooperation, tax morale, technology acceptance (e.g., GM food), or responses during crises (e.g., COVID fears) are also highly relevant. Methodological contributions that review or improve trust measurement (e.g., WVS/EVS comparisons, HGLM/HLM analyses, survey scale audits) qualify as relevant. By contrast, documents where “trust” is incidental or used in a different sense (legal/financial trusts, antitrust law, zero-trust cybersecurity, or casual mentions where trust is a minor control variable) are non-relevant. Edge cases include work on distrust/mistrust, social capital or confidence as proxies, and philosophical treatments of trust in conflict—all relevant—whereas items like “trust region” optimization or proper nouns/brands containing “Trust” are not.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks surveys and datasets that measure public trust—toward governments, institutions, media, international organizations, and major powers—across countries and time. They want data connecting trust to issues like security/defense, EU integration, and GDPR/data privacy, with accompanying demographics for analysis.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly measures or discusses trust as an attitude, such as trust in institutions, political leaders, fellow citizens, media, or supranational bodies (e.g., “trust in NATO/OSCE/EU/UN,” “trust in the EU and its institutions,” “most/least trusted institution,” “general personal trust,” or “trust in data protection by Google/Facebook”). Mentions of mistrust/distrust, trust scales, trends or changes in trust over time, and reasons for trust judgments also count as relevant, including closely related phrasing like “confidence in the new leadership” when it clearly denotes trust in actors or policies. A document can still be relevant even if trust is one of many survey topics (e.g., security policy, EU enlargement, elections) as long as it contains explicit items gauging trust levels or evaluations. Non-relevant items are those that discuss wars, policy, or demographics without any trust measures, that use “confidence” in a statistical or unrelated sense, or that use “trust” only as a legal/financial term. Edge cases include topic lists where “trust” appears only as a passing keyword or as “confidence-building measures” without measurement; these should be deemed relevant only if they include explicit trust constructs like scales, most/least trusted rankings, or trust in problem-solving ability.</narr>

They need a survey-style question asking respondents to indicate their level of trust on a four-point scale (a lot, some, not very much, no trust at all) and whether they tend to trust or tend not to trust those institutions/people.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "trust" when it explicitly asks about or measures levels of trust — for example survey items that ask "How much trust do you have in the Russians/Americans?" or that list institutions like the European Parliament, European Commission, or European Central Bank and provide response options (a lot, some, not very much, none). Relevant examples include question codes and item text such as v25 Q7 TRUST IN RUSSIANS, qa10 1 EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT TRUST, or lists of trust-in-people items by nationality (British, Danes, Finns, etc.). Non-relevant documents are those that mention the word "trust" in unrelated senses (trust funds, legal trusts, idiomatic uses), or that only include a stray country name without any trust question or scale. Edge cases include noisy or duplicated transcripts where the core trust items are present among repeated text, translated or paraphrased surveys where the response scale is implicit, and documents that report aggregate “trust indices” (still relevant) versus documents that merely reference trustworthiness or reputation without measuring respondents’ trust (less relevant).</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “trust” when it directly defines, measures, or analyzes interpersonal or social trust, such as descriptions of validated scales (e.g., the ESS Social Trust Scale or the Interpersonal Trust Short Scale/KUSIV3), their psychometric properties, and cross-national comparability (e.g., metric invariance between the UK and Germany). Content tying trust to related constructs and outcomes—like how transparency dimensions (disclosure, clarity, accuracy, timeliness, relevance) relate to trustworthiness, trust, and job satisfaction—or detailing applications in organizational relationships (employee–superior trust) is also relevant. Technical details that support the measurement of trust (translation methods like TRAPD, item wording, completion time, reliability coefficients) remain relevant if they pertain to assessing trust. By contrast, documents about “trust” in unrelated senses (legal financial trusts, brand names, “antitrust” law, cryptographic trust stores) or about transparency without linking it to trust would be non-relevant. Edge cases include texts that use synonyms like generalized social trust or confidence in others (relevant), or pieces that mention trust only in passing without substantive discussion or measurement (likely non-relevant).</narr>

<title>psychische</title>
<publication>
	<desc>Find research and discussion on mental health burdens (psychische Belastungen): their prevalence, causes, and consequences across populations (parents of young children, students, workers, unemployed, refugees), particularly in Germany and amid recent crises like COVID-19 and the Ukraine war. Also sought are sociological perspectives and evidence on interventions, treatment, and support services.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it meaningfully uses the German adjective “psychische” in its content (title, abstract, or body), especially in phrases like “psychische Belastung,” “psychische Gesundheit,” or “psychische Störungen,” such as studies on parents’ mental strain, COVID-19 impacts, unemployment and mental health, or services for children of mentally ill parents. Items that discuss “psychische Systeme” in systems theory also match the keyword and are relevant for pure term retrieval, though they may be topically less aligned if the user intent is clinical mental health. A document is non-relevant if “psychische” appears only incidentally (e.g., in citations, lists of keywords, or tangential remarks) or if the topic is unrelated and the term is not integral to the main content. Edge cases include capitalization (“Psychische”), inflected forms (“psychischen,” “psychischer”), and hyphenation, which strict exact-match engines might miss but stemmed or lemmatized searches would capture. Likewise, texts using only English equivalents (“mental,” “psychological”) or abbreviations (“psych.”) won’t match unless the system applies synonym or cross-lingual expansion.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks survey datasets and questionnaires focused on psychological well-being and mental health indicators across diverse populations (e.g., children, adults, elderly), including attitudes, impairments, help-seeking, and prevalence. It also looks for associated modules on household telecommunications, internet access and child online safety, animal welfare attitudes, substance use, and detailed demographics and methodology.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses psychological or mental health content, especially survey-based measures of mental well-being or parents’ reports on children’s mental state. Clear signals include mood and affect scales (e.g., anxious, depressed, exhausted, happy), limitations in social or daily activities due to emotional problems, use of professional help or psychotherapy/psychotropic medications, diagnoses, and attitudes toward people with mental health issues. Examples of relevance are Eurobarometer modules on public health/psychological well-being, parent surveys about children’s emotional states, or datasets in which “psychische Auffälligkeit” is measured alongside outcomes. Documents focused on telecommunications, internet access, or animal welfare are non-relevant unless they tie those topics to psychological outcomes (e.g., the emotional impact of online harms on children or parental coping guidance). Edge cases: studies that merely note participants are “psychically healthy” as an inclusion criterion, or that list “psychische Belastbarkeit” without operational mental health measures, are typically non-relevant; addiction or homelessness datasets become relevant if they contain explicit measures of mental disorders or psychological functioning.</narr>

	<desc>Assess whether respondents were treated for a psychological or emotional problem in the past 12 months and capture repeated survey items about that treatment. Also determine whether respondents are exposed to work-related psychosocial stressors that negatively affect their wellbeing and whether their physical or mental health problems were caused or worsened by work (selecting the main reason where applicable).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it contains the exact survey items or variable definitions asking whether someone was treated for a psychological or emotional problem in the last 12 months (e.g., W33201, x33201, y33201) or if it asks about exposure to work-related psychosocial stressors that negatively affect wellbeing (EF1050) or health problems caused or worsened by work in the past 12 months (EK0900P). Highly relevant examples are the full questionnaire or codebook showing the German question text, response options, timeframe (“letzten 12 Monate” / “vor der Berichtswoche”) and the variable codes. Non-relevant documents include general mental-health literature that does not ask about treatment or workplace causation, materials with a different timeframe (e.g., past 6 months), or unrelated occupational topics; simple metadata or summaries without the question wording are only partially useful. Edge cases include translations (English versions can be relevant if they clearly map back to the German items), items that mention “psychische Belastung” without linking to treatment or last-12-months timing (partially relevant), and duplicated strings of the same question (redundant but still relevant if content matches). Prefer sources that preserve both the exact wording and the variable/code context so you can unambiguously map responses to these survey items.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The query seeks summaries and validation details of German-language instruments and projects measuring psychological health and related constructs in nonclinical and workplace contexts (e.g., depression, anxiety, irritation, psychosomatic complaints, idiopathic environmental intolerance, symptom interpretation, psychosocial safety climate, perceived job characteristics). It also asks for brief descriptions of associated studies and scales (e.g., HEALSEE, LoneCovid, FIFI-K, Human Flourishing Scale) including subscales, theoretical bases, and pretest methods.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses mental states or health, such as psychological symptoms, wellbeing, risk, or organizational supports for mental health, including measurement tools or models (e.g., questionnaires on depressivity, irritation, anxiety, psychosomatic complaints, or “psychische Jobanforderungen”). Examples of clearly relevant content include scales grounded in Beck or Lazarus models that assess cognitive/emotional irritation, instruments for idiopathic environmental intolerance that capture psychological complaints, Psychosocial Safety Climate tools about protecting employees’ mental health, or wellbeing measures like the Human Flourishing Scale that include mental health dimensions; projects like LoneCovid or HEALSEE are relevant when they explicitly query psychological complaints or illnesses. Documents are non-relevant if they focus solely on physical conditions or general methodology (e.g., cognitive interview procedures) without linking to psychological constructs, or if “psychische” appears only incidentally (e.g., in a title list) without substantive discussion. Edge cases that should still count as relevant include synonyms and compounds (psychological/mental, psychosocial, psychosomatic) when they concern mental states or wellbeing, organizational-level climate around mental health, or instruments that predict psychological wellbeing from other domains (e.g., leisure interests) with an explicit mental-health linkage. Conversely, materials that mention related terms but analyze only non-psychological outcomes, or that use “psycho-” in unrelated contexts, should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>

They also want evidence-based prevention and rehabilitation strategies, workplace reintegration approaches, supports for affected families and children, and insights on stigma and media influences.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively discusses mental illnesses (psychische Erkrankungen) as conditions—covering definitions/classification, prevalence and costs, treatment or prevention, rehabilitation, work reintegration, social policy/legal aspects, or societal representations and stigma. Examples include policy reports on prevention and disability pensions, studies on children of mentally ill parents or return-to-work after depression, analyses of “depression memes” and their implications, surveys of comorbidity, or historical/organizational perspectives on psychiatric care. Content focused on specific disorders (e.g., anxiety, schizophrenia, depression), on interventions (therapy, medication, coaching), or on risk frameworks in mental health practice is also relevant. Documents are non-relevant when they only mention the term in passing, discuss general stress/well-being without linking to diagnosable disorders, or address unrelated health or administrative topics. Edge cases include pieces about “psychiatric” vs. “psychological” disorders (both acceptable), methodological texts that use “psychische Belastung” without engaging illness concepts (likely marginal), and media/cultural analyses that qualify if they connect portrayal to mental illness understanding or outcomes.</narr>

<research_data>
	<desc>Find German survey-based information on mental illnesses, including prevalence, diagnosis and treatment, psychological wellbeing, and public attitudes. The user seeks data across populations (children, parents, adults, physicians) and related factors such as data sharing, digital health use, and socioeconomic context.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “psychische erkrankungen” if it directly discusses mental illnesses or mental health, for example by measuring diagnosis or treatment of psychische/psychische Störungen, reporting prevalence, hospitalizations for emotional problems, use of psychotherapeutic care or medication, or attitudes and stigma toward people with mental illness. Surveys that include variables such as “psychische Erkrankung” alongside other conditions, ask about chronic psychological conditions, psychotherapeutic treatment, or “psychisches Wohlbefinden,” or assess parental ratings of a child’s “psychische Verfassung” count as relevant. By contrast, materials primarily about politics, telecommunications, internet use, trade policy, or general health without an explicit mental-health component are non-relevant, even if they contain broad well-being or medical context. Edge cases include perinatal or pediatric studies mentioning “psychische und ärztliche Versorgung” or twin/personality research: these are relevant only if they include concrete measures of mental disorders or clinically framed mental health outcomes; personality tests or cognitive tasks without a disorder context are not. Content on substance use framed as psychological/psychiatric disorders or on “Psychologisierung” (societal labeling of problems as mental illness) can be relevant, whereas sections on unrelated domains like animal welfare or internet security are not.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>User is looking for survey items and branching logic about mental health ("psychische Erkrankungen"), specifically questions on recent non‑chronic illness (were you sick in the last four weeks), whether the respondent received treatment for psychological problems in the past 12 months, exposure to work‑related psychosocial stressors that harm well‑being, and whether work caused or worsened physical or mental health. The query also requests the conditional display rules (Einblendung) that show these follow‑up questions when certain prior disease codes/fields (e.g., F095, hd01, hd13) are selected.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "psychische erkrankungen" if it directly asks about or describes mental or psychological problems, their treatment, or work-related mental strain — for example the lines "Waren Sie während der letzten 12 Monate wegen eines psychischen oder seelischen Problems in Behandlung" and "Sind Sie bei Ihrer Arbeit psychisch belastenden Faktoren ausgesetzt" indicate clear relevance. The paragraph repeatedly asks about being sick in the last four weeks, treatment for psychological problems in the last 12 months, and whether work caused or worsened physical or mental health, so those items map tightly to the query. Edge cases include passages that only use generic terms like "Gesundheitsprobleme" or discuss chronic vs non-chronic illnesses without explicitly saying "psychisch" — these are borderline and may be partially relevant if context implies mental health. Non-relevant documents would focus exclusively on physical conditions, contain only administrative codes/variable names (hd16, V255) or routing logic without substantive mental-health content, or be in an unrelated language.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The query seeks German research instruments and surveys related to mental health and psychosomatic conditions, especially non-clinical measures of depression, irritation, anxiety, symptom interpretation, idiopathic environmental intolerance, and wellbeing. It also aims to find tools and studies on workplace psychosocial safety climate and healthcare-seeking behavior, including development, validation, and pretest reports.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly addresses mental illnesses or closely related constructs—such as depression, anxiety, psychosomatic disorders—and their assessment, prevention, diagnosis, symptoms, or treatment. For example, scales on depressivity, irritation (cognitive/emotional), and generalized anxiety in non-clinical contexts, instruments aiming to detect mental or psychosomatic disorders early, workplace “Psychosocial Safety Climate” measures tied to employees’ mental health, and surveys on healthcare seeking that include psychological complaints all match the query. Edge cases include idiopathic environmental intolerance and psychosomatic complaint scales (relevant when psychological symptoms or mental disorder risk are central), as well as Human Flourishing or leisure-interest instruments that touch mental health or predict well-being but may be only tangential unless explicitly linked to mental disorders. Non-relevant items focus primarily on physical conditions (e.g., a cardiology prevention survey without mental health content), administrative pretest details (layout, consent, data protection) without substantive mental-health constructs, or job-characteristic measures not tied to psychological outcomes. German terms such as Depressivität, Angst, psychische/psychosomatische Erkrankungen, and psychische Befindensbeeinträchtigung signal relevance—even in non-clinical settings—when the aim is prevention or identification of mental illness.</narr>

<title>psychische belastung</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking an overview of psychische Belastung (psychological strain), including its definition, prevalence and recent trends, risk factors, and impacts on health, work, and child development across various groups. They also want evidence-based assessment tools and interventions to reduce burden and promote wellbeing, particularly in the German context.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “psychische belastung” when psychological burden/strain is a central topic—defined, measured, or analyzed in depth—such as studies reporting prevalence and consequences among parents of infants, employees, prisoners (JD-R model), caregivers, migrants, or youth, or reports offering interventions and instruments (e.g., COPSOQ) to assess or reduce it. Highly relevant examples include analyses linking parental psychological burden to child developmental outcomes, Fehlzeiten reports on workplace mental strain and prevention, or meta-analyses of caregiver burden with predictors and intervention effects. Methodological or theoretical pieces that operationalize the construct (e.g., differentiating psychische Belastung from demands, or mediators like emotional competencies) are also relevant if they explicitly address measurement or mechanisms of psychological strain. A document is non-relevant if “psychische Belastung” is mentioned only in passing (e.g., as one item in a list of societal problems), if the focus is solely on physical workload, general economic policy, or psychiatric treatment without framing experiences as psychological burden. Edge cases include texts using close variants or synonyms (“psychisch belastet,” “psychische Belastungen,” “mental strain”), interdisciplinary volumes where burden is treated as a cross-cutting theme, or tools like emotion diaries—these are relevant when they directly engage with how psychological burden is assessed, mediated, or accommodated; they are not relevant when “Belastung” is merely metaphorical or unrelated to mental strain.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking survey-based information on psychological stress, including how it is measured, experienced, and influenced across contexts such as work, education, family/partnerships, and health. They want factors, prevalence, and effects on well-being and performance, particularly within occupational safety and organizational settings.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it meaningfully addresses psychological stress/burden (psychische Belastung) as a condition, cause, or outcome—using terms like seelische Belastung, psychisches Wohlbefinden, mental strain, stress, or burnout—especially in contexts such as work, study, family, health, or relationships. Clear signals include scales or indices of mental strain, questions on time pressure, social conflict, organizational problems, or “nervliche Belastungen,” and consequences like anxiety, depression, reduced performance, or absenteeism (e.g., “psychische Belastungen am Arbeitsplatz,” “psychische und physische Belastung,” “psychische Wirkungen” of experiences). Examples that qualify are teacher surveys on “Belastung durch Schüler,” workplace modules listing “psychische Belastungen” alongside hazards, or health sections capturing mental well-being and stress-related complaints. A document is non-relevant if “Belastung” refers only to physical, environmental, mechanical, or administrative loads without a mental component, or if “psychische” appears merely as a token in a list with no substantive treatment. Edge cases: combined phrases like “psychische und physische Belastung” are relevant; topics like AIDS, sexuality, addiction, or family life qualify only when they assess mental strain or well-being, whereas discussions of general “Belastung” or “Belastbarkeit” without psychological context do not.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A concise summary of whether and how people experience psychological (seelische) burden — e.g., whether they received treatment for mental problems in the past 12 months, are exposed to work‑related psychological or physical stressors that harm their well‑being, and have health issues caused or worsened by work. It also covers related concerns about financial burdens (monthly loan payments, extra costs from health‑care reform) and who (young vs. old) will carry future financial strains.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to this query if it explicitly addresses "psychische Belastung" or equivalent survey items — for example, questions about being in treatment for a mental or emotional problem in the last 12 months, exposure to psychological stressors at work, or work-related health problems that are mental or psychosomatic in nature. Relevant documents also include survey instruments or reports that contain the exact question wording or variable codes (e.g., q033as, V199, V217) and analyses linking financial burdens (monthly interest/repayment) or policy changes (healthcare reform) to mental well‑being. Non‑relevant documents are those that mention “Belastung” only in a purely financial, legal, or physical context (e.g., mortgage interest or tax reform) without any connection to mental health, or texts that list variable names without corresponding question content. Borderline cases include papers on economic hardship or healthcare reform that discuss general burdens — these are relevant only if they explicitly analyze mental health outcomes or cite the same 12‑month / work‑related framing; translations, paraphrases, or duplicate survey copies that preserve the meaning should be treated as relevant.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “psychische Belastung” when it explicitly measures, describes, or seeks to prevent psychological strain or mental burden, especially in non-clinical or workplace contexts. Clear positives include instruments and studies on irritation (cognitive/emotional), non-clinical depressivity or anxiety, psychosocial safety climate (organizational commitment to employees’ mental health), perceived job characteristics (job demands, decision latitude), teacher scales capturing experienced burden, and tools designed to detect preclinical intervention needs or psychosomatic complaints from ongoing stressors. Items about general well-being or mental health (e.g., Human Flourishing, LoneCovid social relations, healthcare-seeking) are only partially relevant unless they directly quantify psychological load or strain. Non-relevant examples include evaluation tools for exam quality or leisure interests (where “Belastung” may denote test difficulty or workload), or symptom-interpretation measures that focus on attribution rather than the level of psychological burden. Edge cases like idiopathic environmental intolerance can be relevant if framed as psychosomatic/psychological strain, and terms such as “Betriebsklima,” “Jobanforderungen,” or “psychische Befindensbeeinträchtigung” are strong relevance signals, whereas “Belastung” used purely for task load or administrative burden without a mental health frame is not.</narr>

<title>environment</title>
<publication>

They want evidence, frameworks, and measurement tools linking environmental contexts to health, cognition, safety, behavior, performance, and policy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “environment” when it treats an environment as the central object of analysis or intervention and examines how its features affect outcomes, whether that environment is natural, built/urban, institutional, learning, or workplace. For example, studies of the built environment’s association with obesity, urban environment quality and perceived safety, or the separate effects of home and institutional learning environments on children’s vocabulary are squarely relevant. Work on environmental policy and attitudes (e.g., ISSP Environment), virtual nature environments’ psychological effects, or trade agreements’ environment provisions also fit because “environment” is integral to the research question. By contrast, papers that mention “environment” only as a generic backdrop (such as “digital business environment” in a strategy overview) or as a passing label (e.g., retail “shopping environment” aesthetics) are less relevant unless the environment’s attributes are measured and causally linked to outcomes. Edge cases include uses in computing (software/runtime environments) or organizational culture; judge relevance by prominence (title/abstract), term frequency, presence of related concepts (ecology, urban design, sustainability), and whether the environment is operationalized with specific indicators.</narr>

Includes interest in instruments like the 2024 Environmental Consciousness in Germany survey and modules on environmental policy and nuclear energy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “environment” when it substantively addresses the natural environment or environmental issues, such as environmental awareness and behavior, pollution, climate/air quality, environmental policy, health–environment links, or willingness to support environmental protection (e.g., the Environmental Consciousness in Germany series, EU attitudes toward environment modules, or surveys on nuclear energy and environmental risks). Housing or neighborhood studies are relevant if they explicitly measure environmental conditions in the living environment—clean air, perceived environmental problems, expected changes in local environmental issues, or satisfaction with environmental conditions—even when embedded among broader housing topics. Items are only marginally relevant when “environment” appears as one life-domain among many (e.g., a general quality-of-life list) or as a single rating area for government performance without deeper environmental content. Documents using “environment” to mean social/professional/research settings (e.g., research environment of professors, functional illiteracy in the professional environment, crime in the local environment) are non-relevant unless they tie back to ecological or environmental protection themes. Edge cases include surveys focused on mobility, foreigners, or voting that become relevant only if they include dedicated sections on environmental attitudes, policies, or behaviors; mere keyword mentions in metadata or headings without topical discussion should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A concise description of survey items measuring public attitudes toward the environment, including personal willingness to protect it (e.g., paying higher prices or taxes, cutting standard of living), how important environmental protection is personally, perceived seriousness of various environmental problems (nuclear power, leaded fuel, industrial pollution, noise, etc.), opinions on public bodies’ effectiveness and preferred level of government involvement, and main sources of environmental information.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "environment" if it explicitly addresses environmental topics such as attitudes toward protection, willingness to bear costs (taxes, higher prices, lower standard of living), perceived seriousness of specific problems (aircraft noise, industrial pollution, nuclear power), information sources about the environment, or levels of authority involvement. For example, survey items like "How willing to protect environment," "OVERALL IMPACT INDUSTRIAL AIR POLLUTION," and "Which are your three main sources of information about the environment" are clearly on-topic and indicate the document contains public-opinion or policy-related environmental content. Edge cases include items that only mention “environment” tangentially (e.g., a one-line reference in a broader economic report), brand names or metaphors using the word “environment,” or discussions of taxes that are unrelated to environmental protection; these would be less relevant. Also note that repeated labels, metadata, and year markers (1988, 1992) suggest a survey instrument or codebook—highly relevant for research into public attitudes but less so if the user seeks scientific measurements or ecological impact studies.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking scholarly resources on measuring and analyzing “environment” in a social-science context—especially validated questionnaires for environmental attitudes, behaviors, and efficacy, and methodological guidance on using mobile and web-tracking data to study individual behavior in online/social environments.</desc>
	<narr>A document is clearly relevant if it addresses the natural environment or ecological issues, such as environmental attitudes, behaviors, and knowledge, or presents measurement tools like the Scale System for Environmental Consciousness (SEU), the Ecology Scale, perceptions of global ecological problems, or environmental efficacy. For example, questionnaires that gauge willingness to refrain from certain behaviors for the sake of the environment, to donate money for protection, or beliefs that pro-environmental actions make a difference (e.g., the ISSP environmental efficacy scale with seven items and cross-country psychometrics) directly match the query. Content focused on web tracking or mobile research methods is non-relevant unless it explicitly applies those methods to environmental topics (e.g., studies of climate change communication), as references to “online environments” alone are about digital contexts, not ecology. Mentions of “social environment” or a “sense of belonging” are edge cases that use the term in a social-psychological sense and would generally be non-relevant to an environmental query. Likewise, scales like Right-Wing Authoritarianism or interviews about app infrastructure are non-relevant unless they are tied to environmental outcomes or behavior.</narr>

They want perspectives contrasting mainstream and critical/non-mainstream approaches (e.g., clinical dominance, data sharing and publishing, nomological vs hermeneutic methods, indigenous/feminist/antiracist and cross-cultural currents) and their implications for teaching and practice.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses psychology as a discipline—its theories, methods, practices, or debates—such as interviews with psychologists, critiques of mainstream versus critical psychology, discussions of data sharing and infrastructures like PsychData, pedagogy, or the role of clinical psychology. Comparative, historical, or cultural perspectives (e.g., indigenous psychologies in China or Brazil, psychology under fascism, feminist/antiracist or postmodern approaches) are also relevant because they analyze psychology’s scope and impact. Non-relevant items are those that only mention “Psychologie” in passing (course listings, citation metadata, brand names) or focus primarily on adjacent fields (psychiatry, general philosophy) without linking back to psychological science. Edge cases include interdisciplinary work in neuroscience, linguistics, or anthropology: it is relevant if it explicitly frames implications for psychological theory or practice, but not if psychology is merely background. German-language usage and capitalization (Psychologie) match the query and are relevant; unrelated uses of similar terms or translations should be excluded.</narr>

They likely want datasets or documentation on variables and analyses tied to psychological diagnostics (e.g., psychometric quality in special education) across different populations.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “psychologie” if it substantively treats psychology as a discipline or practice—for example by discussing psychological constructs, psychometric quality of tests, mental health or counseling, or public attitudes toward psychology’s scientific status. Clear matches include surveys that measure interest in psychology, compare the standing of psychology among sciences, analyze personality and social behavior development in youth, or evaluate diagnostic/assessment procedures in educational contexts. Documents focused solely on international politics, economics, housing, or education policy without a psychological dimension, or that merely list “Psychologie” alongside other fields without psychology-specific variables or analysis, are non-relevant. Edge cases include multi-topic barometers: they are relevant only if they contain items on psychology (e.g., use of psychological counseling, attitudes toward psychology, psychometric criteria), while occurrences limited to journal titles, institutional names, or metadata are not. Another borderline case is science-comparison content (e.g., USSR vs. USA) that explicitly compares psychology among disciplines, which can be relevant; generic boilerplate mentions are not.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for a concise overview of "psychology" — what it studies (mind and behavior), its major subfields (e.g., clinical, cognitive, developmental, social), common research methods, and practical applications such as therapy, assessment, and career paths.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "psychologie" if its main content directly discusses psychology topics — for example papers on cognitive processes, clinical therapy methods, developmental stages, psychological research findings, or program descriptions for a "psychologie" degree. Relevance is stronger when the term appears in headings, abstracts, or detailed sections rather than just a passing mention; an academic article about cognitive biases or a mental-health blog post that explains therapy techniques are clearly relevant. Non-relevant documents merely containing the word (e.g., a company name, an unrelated news story that quotes "psychologie" once, or an SEO page repeating the term without substantive content) should be excluded. Edge cases include multilingual pages where "psychologie" appears but most content is in another language, interdisciplinary works (e.g., social neuroscience) that partially focus on psychology, and course listings that name "psychologie" but provide no description — these can be borderline and require judging whether the psychological content is substantive.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “psychologie” if it explicitly engages with psychology as a field—e.g., references to psychological theories, methods, institutions, or applications—and/or contains the term “Psychologie.” The provided paragraph qualifies because it mentions Medizinische Psychologie and an Institut für Psychologie and applies behavioral psychology to hand hygiene compliance and to evaluating digital teaching via validated questionnaires. By contrast, a text focused only on hygiene procedures, infection control metrics, or survey administration details without a psychological framework would be weakly relevant, even if situated in a hospital or university. Edge cases include mentions of “Psychologie” only in affiliations, bibliographies, or course listings without substantive psychological content, which are marginal; English equivalents (“psychology”) or adjacent fields (behavioral science, psychiatry) may be relevant depending on user intent. Likewise, documents about digital teaching that lack psychological constructs or institutional ties to psychology would not satisfy the query.</narr>

They also want perspectives on justice and security implications and the evolution of national climate policies.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “climate change” when it substantively addresses climate change/global warming—its causes, impacts, mitigation or adaptation, public opinion, or governance (e.g., IPCC assessments, decarbonization, net-zero). Analyses of trust in climate science, surveys of climate-friendly behaviors in the EU, how climate literacy conditions migration intentions in Africa, or framing climate impacts as security or human-rights issues are relevant because they explicitly link social or policy outcomes to climate change. Content on media communication of climate issues, country policy evolution (such as China’s or Japan’s climate policy), risk perception determinants, or education programs that aim to increase climate knowledge and action also qualify. Non-relevant items include pieces that use “climate” metaphorically (business/organizational climate), discuss weather events or disasters without attributing them to climate change, focus on COVID-19 or general politics without an explicit climate connection, or mention climate change only in passing. Edge cases: studies of recycling or energy choices are relevant if framed as climate mitigation; disaster case studies (e.g., typhoons) are relevant only when tied to climate change; and synonyms like global warming, climate crisis, decarbonization, or net-zero should be treated as in scope.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses climate change or closely related themes such as climate protection, mitigation/adaptation policies, public attitudes, and the energy transition—for example, surveys on CO2 taxes, speed limits, kerosene taxes, electric vehicles, or assessments of Germany/EU climate measures and their impacts. Methodological descriptions (sampling, demographics, randomization) are still relevant when they frame studies about climate change opinions or behaviors, like mobility choices tied to emissions or perceived climate risks. Mixed-topic surveys remain relevant if climate change is a major module, even alongside other themes (poverty, elections), and content using synonyms like “climate protection,” “energy transition,” or policy areas (transport, agriculture, power supply) aimed at emissions reduction qualifies. By contrast, documents where “climate change” appears only incidentally in long lists without analysis, or pieces focused solely on unrelated issues (e.g., healthcare reform, general lobbying without a climate angle, or “organizational climate”) are non-relevant. Edge cases include environmental-awareness studies that discuss noise or litter but not climate change (non-relevant), versus mobility or ticketing policies discussed explicitly as climate measures (relevant).</narr>

	<desc>A request for who within the EU is seen as responsible for tackling climate change — i.e., which actors (national governments, the EU, regional/local authorities, businesses/industry, individuals, “all of them,” none, or others) people assign responsibility to. This likely reflects a survey question asking respondents to indicate which of those categories should tackle climate change.</desc>
	<narr>This document is relevant because it explicitly contains repeated survey questions and coded responses about who within the EU is responsible for tackling climate change (answers including national governments, the European Union, businesses, regional/local authorities, individuals, “all of them,” “none,” and “don’t know”). A high-quality relevant document would provide clear, interpretable results or analysis (e.g., aggregated percentages, methodology, or commentary on public opinion across those categories). It would be less useful if it only contains raw, duplicated codes or transcription noise as here — still topically relevant but requiring cleaning and mapping of codes to meaningful labels. Edge cases include texts that mention “climate change” but discuss only scientific impacts (weather, ecosystems) without responsibility or policy, or documents about global responsibility frameworks that aren’t specific to the EU; those are partially relevant for context but not for the specific query about who within the EU is responsible.</narr>

	<desc>The user is looking for social and behavioral science resources related to climate change. Specifically, they seek methods and instruments to study climate change communication and to measure individuals’ awareness of global environmental consequences (e.g., web tracking guides and relevant scales).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “climate change” when it addresses Earth’s changing climate, its causes, impacts, mitigation/adaptation policies, scientific evidence, or public communication about climate change—for example, a guide that uses web tracking to study climate change communication or research that measures awareness of consequences for global environmental changes. In contrast, texts that use “climate” in a non-environmental sense (e.g., family climate, teaching climate, organizational climate indexes like BOKX) are not relevant, nor are materials focused on organizational change, acculturation, occupational classifications (EGP, Blossfeld), course evaluations, or general LLM overviews without climate-specific content. Brief or passing mentions, such as listing “climate change communication” among many example topics in a methods guide, are only marginally relevant unless the document contains substantive sections on that topic. An edge case is a psychological scale about “global environmental changes”: it may be relevant if it explicitly measures climate change attitudes or behaviors, but not if it treats environmental issues in a vague or unrelated way. Similarly, pandemic-related fear scales or gender role attitude surveys are non-relevant unless they explicitly link findings to climate change contexts.</narr>

<title>bildungsgrad</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an overview of educational attainment (Bildungsgrad) in the EU/Germany, including how it is defined/measured and recent trends by age and gender. They also want evidence on how education level correlates with employment, internet use, service utilization, civic/political attitudes, and health behaviors.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly discusses educational attainment (Bildungsgrad) or closely related terms, especially when measuring or comparing education levels across groups, regions, or time, or linking them to outcomes. Examples include analyses of secondary/tertiary completion rates, gender differences in university degrees, employment or internet use by education level, health behavior stratified by education, or survey-based results (e.g., ALLBUS, Mikrozensus) that report indicators by educational level. Texts using synonyms like Bildungsstand/Bildungsniveau, formal credentials (Hochschulabschluss, Sekundarstufe II, tertiär), or phrases such as niedrig/hoch gebildet are also relevant. Documents are non-relevant if they mention the word only in passing (e.g., in a list, footnote, or author bio), discuss “education” generally without referring to levels/attainment, or use “Grad” for non-educational meanings. Edge cases include OCR or inflected variants (Bildungsgrades, Bildungsgrads), hyphenations (Bildungs-grad), or proxies like “Volksschülerinnen ohne Lehre”; these should count if they clearly denote education level, while unrelated compounds should not.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks information on “Bildungsgrad” (educational attainment) as captured in socio-demographic surveys—especially variables for the highest education of respondents, parents, and main earners. They may also be looking for research on intergenerational effects, such as how grandparents’ education influences young adults’ attainment (e.g., Abitur).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “bildungsgrad” if it explicitly contains variables or analysis on educational attainment, such as “höchster Bildungsgrad des Befragten/Eltern/Großeltern,” years of schooling, or school-leaving certificates (e.g., Abitur), or if it centers an analysis on education outcomes (like the SOEP study on grandparental education affecting Abitur by age 21). Survey descriptions that list “Bildungsgrad,” “Schulbildung,” “höchster Schulabschluss,” or “Bildungsniveau” in the demographics for respondents, partners, parents, or household heads are also relevant, even if education is not the main topic. By contrast, materials focused on immigration, religion, politics, or lifestyle that lack any field capturing education level are non-relevant; if they only mention “Bildung” as a policy area or expenditure category (education spending) without an attainment measure, that is weakly or non-relevant. Edge cases include datasets where “Bildungsgrad” appears only in metadata (e.g., interviewer’s education) or as a single demographic item in a long topic list—these are still relevant but with low topical strength compared to studies primarily about educational attainment. Synonyms and related terms like “Bildungsabschluss,” “Schulabschluss,” or “länderspezifischer Bildungsgrad” should be treated as matches, while generic mentions of “Bildung” without a level or credential should not.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The searcher wants a clear definition of the German term "Bildungsgrad" — the level or degree of formal education someone has attained. They likely seek how it’s classified or measured (e.g., school leaving certificates, vocational training, university degrees) for surveys, statistics, or personal profiles.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "bildungsgrad" if it explicitly addresses educational attainment or "education level" — for example census tables, survey reports, academic papers, or datasets that define and report categories such as "no formal education", "primary", "secondary", or "tertiary." Relevant items will explain how the bildungsgrad is measured (question wording, age cutoffs, ISCED mapping), give breakdowns by demographics (age, region, income), or use the term in a German-language policy or research context. Non-relevant documents merely mentioning the word in passing, using "degree" in a non-educational sense (e.g., mathematical degree or temperature degree), or focusing on unrelated aspects of "Bildung" without classifying levels would not be useful. Edge cases include English-language sources that never use the German term but fully cover "education level" (these are relevant), and historical texts that use obsolete educational categories or inconsistent mappings — they may be relevant but require careful interpretation.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user wants a clear definition and translation of the German term "Bildungsgrad"—i.e., the level or degree of education—along with how it is measured or classified and common contexts or synonyms where the term is used.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant for the keyword "bildungsgrad" if it explicitly discusses a person's or group's educational level or attainment, such as descriptions of primary/secondary/tertiary education, years of schooling, degrees, qualifications, or survey statistics measuring education. Relevant examples include demographic studies reporting average bildungsgrad, CVs and application forms listing an applicant's bildungsgrad, policy papers on education levels, and datasets using ISCED codes or years of schooling as proxies. Documents are non-relevant when the word appears only once in passing, in unrelated boilerplate or metadata, as an OCR/artifact error, or in contexts where "grad" means degree/angle/temperature rather than education. Edge cases include texts using synonyms or translations ("educational level," "Schulabschluss") that are conceptually relevant despite not containing the exact keyword, and bilingual documents where the German term appears alongside an English explanation; these should be considered relevant if the educational concept is clearly addressed.</narr>

<title>politisches engagement</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks scholarly information on political/civic engagement, its forms, and the mechanisms that promote or hinder it—particularly the roles of associations/skills, education, income, migration, gender, and dissatisfaction. They also want evidence on trends in Germany (especially post-reunification), youth patterns, and how state policies and programs foster engagement.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly examines political engagement—such as voting, party membership, conventional participation, legal/illegal protest, activism—or the mechanisms, predictors, and effects behind it. Clear matches include empirical studies of Vereinsmitgliedschaft and skills acquisition as drivers of participation, ALLBUS-based analyses linking education and income to engagement, youth and migration studies that trace inequalities in political participation, or discussions framed in the input/output logic of the political system and post‑DDR protest dynamics. Civic or voluntary engagement texts are relevant when they explicitly connect to political participation or state “Engagementpolitik” (for example, how organizations, resources, or program designs affect political involvement). Non‑relevant items include pieces on volunteering as a tool for labor‑market reintegration without a political dimension, administrative program evaluations that don’t address participation, generic overviews of “bürgerschaftliches Engagement” with no political link, or uses of “Engagement” meaning employee, personal, or romantic commitment. Edge cases include union activism that straddles workplace and political arenas, development-policy engagement where only some activities are political, and studies on political interest—relevant when treated as a precursor to participation but not when disconnected from engagement behaviors.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks data and analysis on political and civic engagement in Germany—who participates, how, and why—spanning contexts like foundations, local politics, environmentalism, refugee aid, and youth activism. They want comparative insights across demographic and regional groups (e.g., women, LSBTIQ, students, retirees) on motivations, barriers, attitudes, and participation behaviors from multiple surveys.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it addresses political engagement as attitudes or behaviors such as political interest, party membership, voting, participation in protests or Bürgerinitiativen, digital activism, or volunteering with a political aim (e.g., refugee advocacy, environmental campaigning, local policy involvement). Survey descriptions that measure political participation, efficacy, policy preferences, or readiness to engage (especially among women, youth, retirees, or specific communities like LSBTIQ) are clearly on-topic; examples include items on demonstrations, petitions, civic organizations, or collaboration with authorities. Materials focused solely on non-political aspects—housing conditions, environmental quality, or philanthropic administration (e.g., foundation assets, legal form)—are non-relevant unless they explicitly link to civic or political action, motives, or policy influence. Edge cases include “soziales Engagement” that is purely charitable (borderline unless tied to public policy or advocacy) and documents using “Engagement” in other senses (e.g., employee engagement), which are not relevant. References to motivations, barriers, and outcomes of engagement (including digital and episodic forms) strengthen relevance, whereas demographic lists without a participation or politics component do not.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The searcher wants to know whether political participation can achieve real change and how people view getting involved in politics—seeking public-opinion information on the effectiveness of engagement, support for specific state measures (e.g., taxation, job-creation), attitudes toward party directions and cooperation (CDU, SPD, Greens), EU development, and tolerance of political opponents.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "politisches Engagement" when it explicitly addresses engagement in politics — for example questions or statements about whether people can achieve something through political engagement, descriptions of actions like voting, campaigning, joining parties, contacting representatives, protesting, or survey items asking about willingness to participate. The repeated survey item "GLAUBEN SIE DASS MAN DURCH ENGAGEMENT IN DER POLITIK ETWAS ERREICHEN KANN" is a clear positive signal, whereas lines about party positioning (e.g. "CDU politisch nach links entwickelt") are not relevant unless they are explicitly tied to mobilization or calls for participation. Watch out for false positives: phrases like "staatliches Engagement" (state intervention) or generic "Engagement" (volunteering for non-political causes) mention the word but do not concern civic/political participation. Edge cases include documents that only briefly mention engagement inside a long list of political items (partial relevance), or texts about political attitudes without any behavioral component (borderline relevant); relevance should be higher when the document contains concrete actions, efficacy evaluations, or repeated focused discussion of political engagement.</narr>

They want details on the constructs covered, psychometric properties, and pretesting methods, including examples from projects such as DDR participation studies and CSES Module 5.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly measures, analyzes, or describes political engagement or participation, such as instruments or studies on citizens’ political activities, interest, or efficacy (e.g., SOWI’s Politisches Engagement scale, the DDR “Eingabenkultur” project on participation, CSES items on political interest/participation, or PEKS as a close antecedent of engagement). It also counts if it targets engagement within a political domain like environmental politics when it involves public or collective actions (protests, petitions, contacting officials), not just private eco-behaviors. Documents are non-relevant when “engagement” refers to non-political contexts (workplace engagement in EXQ, “perceived engagement” in LMX) or appears as a subfacet label unrelated to political action (e.g., NFC’s “engagement” facet, ALLO-15’s engagement with outgroups), and when content focuses solely on ideology or attitudes without a link to participation (e.g., SECS-GER) unless tied to engagement outcomes. Edge cases include constructs like political cynicism or false consensus beliefs: they are relevant if framed as determinants or measures connected to political participation, but not if they only gauge attitudes with no behavioral or participatory implication. Historical or methodological pieces (cognitive interview pretests) are relevant when the items explicitly assess political engagement, even if the document’s primary focus is instrument validation rather than behavior.</narr>

<title>nachhaltigkeit</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an interdisciplinary overview of sustainability in the German context—how it is defined, balanced across ecological, social, and economic dimensions, and grounded in intergenerational justice. They want insights into implementation and communication (policy, work, media, education), public perceptions, and evaluations of progress and social impacts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses Nachhaltigkeit/sustainable development as a concept, framework, or practice—e.g., defining its pillars (ecological, economic, social), linking it to intergenerational justice, or detailing how it is operationalized through participatory decision-making, metrics, and evaluations. Examples of clearly relevant content include analyses of Germany’s performance on emissions and inequality, sectoral applications (transport policy, forestry and “forest bathing,” higher education access, development cooperation), and empirical studies or surveys on how people understand and act on sustainability. Meta-level treatments—such as discourse and risk-communication analyses, sociological debates (“second wave” of sustainability sociology), or methodological guides for detecting and resolving sustainability dilemmas—are also relevant. A document is non-relevant if it only name-drops the term, uses “nachhaltig” merely to mean “lasting” (e.g., “sustainable effects” in a generic program evaluation) without engaging sustainability as a normative or multi-dimensional concept, or employs the term as branding without substance. Edge cases: theoretical critiques (ideology vs. utopia) remain relevant; pieces focused solely on fiscal or “structural sustainability” are only partially relevant unless they connect to broader ecological/social aims; duplicates or near-duplicates contribute little additional value.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks empirical studies and survey datasets on sustainability—covering concepts, public attitudes, and behaviors (especially sustainable food consumption and climate protection)—with representative German/European samples, methods, and demographic breakdowns. It also looks for comparative social indicator time series that track sustainability alongside quality of life and social cohesion.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “nachhaltigkeit” when sustainability is a central focus, whether conceptual (definitions and dimensions) or empirical (attitudes, behaviors, or policies across environmental, social, and economic aspects). Strong examples include representative surveys on sustainability, analyses of sustainable food consumption and demand for Bio/Fair Trade products using methods like Multiple Correspondence Analysis, and indicator frameworks such as the European System of Social Indicators that treat sustainability as a core pillar. Partially relevant items are multipurpose surveys where sustainability is one module among others (e.g., COVID-19 polls that include climate protection/sustainability) or technology studies (e.g., urban drones) that explicitly measure perceived sustainability alongside safety and utility. An important edge case is the German use of “Nachhaltigkeit” to mean durability or lasting impact (e.g., program effectiveness or the legacy of events like World Youth Day), which matches the keyword but may not address environmental sustainability. Non-relevant documents are those that only mention the term in passing without substantive data, analysis, or discussion, or that focus on unrelated topics (e.g., smartphone usage) without a clear link to sustainability practices or outcomes.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A user searching "Nachhaltigkeit" is likely looking for a clear definition and overview of sustainability, including its environmental, social, and economic dimensions. They may also want practical strategies, examples, metrics, or policies for implementing and measuring sustainable practices at personal, organizational, or societal levels.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "nachhaltigkeit" if it directly addresses sustainability — for example discussions of environmental, social, or economic sustainability, corporate sustainability reports, lifecycle assessments, policy papers, or case studies of sustainable practices in energy, agriculture, or supply chains. Documents that only mention the word in passing (e.g., a single sentence in a long unrelated article), use it as a marketing buzzword without evidence, or treat it metaphorically are less relevant because they do not provide substantive information on the topic. Language and terminology matter: German-language content containing “Nachhaltigkeit” is an obvious match, but English texts using “sustainability” or domain-specific terms (e.g., circular economy, ESG, carbon footprint) are also relevant; misspellings, OCR errors, or translations can create edge cases where relevant material might be missed. Authority and timeliness affect relevance too — recent research, government guidelines, and NGO reports are typically more useful than outdated blog posts or product listings — while pages where the term only appears in metadata, comments, or unrelated contexts (homophones, names) should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking resources on sustainability in mathematics education. Specifically, they want assessment instruments that measure beliefs about the role of mathematics in sustainable development and learners’ self-efficacy in mathematical modeling, such as the BMNE and related scales developed and piloted in a teaching project.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “nachhaltigkeit” when it substantively discusses sustainability or sustainable development, including frameworks like “Bildung für nachhaltige Entwicklung” (BNE/ESD) or applications such as modeling sustainability-related topics (e.g., speed limits, heat pumps, electric cars). Content that measures beliefs or competencies tied to sustainability—such as scales assessing the perceived importance of mathematics for sustainable development or self-efficacy in mathematical modeling for sustainability—also counts as relevant. Mentions of recognized policy or competency documents (e.g., KMK/BMZ 2016 on Global Development competencies) strengthen relevance by situating the work in the sustainability education context. By contrast, documents that use “nachhaltig” only in a generic sense (like “lasting impact” or “durable”) or that include “Nachhaltigkeit” merely in a project title or funding note without substantive discussion are weakly or non-relevant. Edge cases include texts focusing on methodology (e.g., psychometric scale development) that still apply directly to sustainability themes—these are relevant—whereas methodological pieces with no clear link to sustainability topics would not be.</narr>

<title>politische werte</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user is seeking scholarly information on political values—how they are defined, measured, and structured, and how they relate to religion, demographics, ideology, and political participation. They also want evidence on value change and its effects across contexts (especially Germany but including comparative cases), plus methodological considerations (e.g., missing data) and the role of media/public discourse.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly analyzes political values or value orientations—defining dimensions like participation, egalitarianism, postmaterialism, or security/universalism; examining their correlates (e.g., with religion, age, education); or linking them to political behavior and attitudes (such as studies using ALLBUS, Eurobarometer, or GLES, SEM/LISREL to show value–voting links like nonconformist values and AfD support). Theoretical and comparative treatments that frame conflicts in terms of values—liberalism vs communitarianism, “Asian values,” headscarf regulations, or value change in transitions—are also relevant because they explicate which political values are promoted, contested, or evolving. Partially relevant are items that use “value” to mean utility in a political setting (e.g., the value of TV debates or the “publizistischer Wert” of media audiences), which match the term but do not analyze political value orientations. Non-relevant are methodological texts where “Werte” denotes data values (e.g., missing values in roll-call analyses) or uses of “value” unrelated to normative or attitudinal politics. Edge cases include general moral-philosophical discussions or subgroup studies (students, Russian elites); they are relevant when they explicitly connect values to political orientations or behavior, but not when they focus on measurement artifacts or generic worth.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is looking for empirical surveys and datasets that measure political values and orientations—such as political interest, efficacy, participation, and party preference—alongside demographic correlates. They want sources (e.g., Eurobarometer, youth/Gen Z panels) to analyze how political values have evolved over time in Germany and Europe, particularly among young people.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses political values or closely linked constructs such as value scales and orientations (e.g., importance of individual, occupational, or societal values; postmaterialism), ideological self-placement (left–right), authoritarian/libertarian attitudes, political interest/efficacy, trust in institutions, party preference, and participation. Surveys and applications like Eurobarometer, EU Profiler, or youth/Gen Z studies that analyze democracy satisfaction, EU integration attitudes, policy issue positions, and the salience of value priorities clearly fit, even when they use terms like Werthaltungen, Wertvorstellungen, gesellschaftliche Werte, politische Wirksamkeit, or Entfremdung von Politik. Non-relevant are items where “Werte” denotes numeric amounts rather than values (e.g., trade “Wert und Anteil” in export tables 1913–1933) or descriptions of workplace/industrial conditions without a substantive link to political value orientations. Edge cases include texts about life or religious values that lack a political connection (borderline) versus pieces on media use or civic engagement that become relevant when tied to political values or orientations. Documents in various country contexts or languages remain relevant if the central focus is the measurement or discussion of political values and related attitudes.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for a summary of survey items measuring political values and engagement: which political actions people would take (e.g., voting, demonstrations, petitions, party work, traffic blockades), scales for willingness to act and perceived personal influence (e.g., 1–7 or 1–10), and general evaluations of political parties and government. They want a concise description of these questionnaire measures and response scales.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "politische werte" if it addresses political values, attitudes or norms — for example survey items or scales that ask people to evaluate parties or the government, or that record willingness to take civic actions (voting, demonstrations, petitions, joining a party). The paragraph shown is clearly relevant: it lists response-coded items about political influence (V134–V144) and evaluative scales like "view government very bad — very good" and party ratings, which operationalize political values through attitudes and behavioral intentions. It would be non‑relevant if the text only uses the word "values" in an economic or appraisal sense, contains legal/administrative codes without attitudinal content, or is purely procedural (rules for protests) with no measure of personal or normative beliefs. Edge cases include questionnaire fragments that only show response scales or repeated instructions — these are borderline: they indicate a values survey (so relevant) but may lack enough context to interpret which political values are measured; similarly, translations or lists of variable codes without labels reduce usefulness. In short, prioritize documents that explicitly link opinions, norms or civic actions to evaluative scales or questions about the political system; exclude texts where "values" is unrelated or where only metadata appears.</narr>

They also want methodological guidance on handling missing data and response biases in surveys, plus references to relevant datasets and pretests (e.g., FGZ Cohesion Panel, CSES Module 5, PAWCER) for comparative analysis.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “politische werte” if it defines, measures, or analyzes political value orientations (e.g., tolerance, egalitarianism, conservatism, authoritarianism) or presents instruments and findings about them, such as the IRV short scale linked to the Schwartz value model, political efficacy (PEKS), political cynicism (KPZ), and German versions of social/economic conservatism (SECS GER). Content that ties specific issue attitudes to broader values—like items on climate change, antisemitism, gender equality, asylum policy, or environmental engagement—can also be relevant when framed as manifestations of underlying political values (e.g., tolerance vs. exclusion, universalism vs. tradition). Cross-national surveys and modules (CSES, PAWCER, left–right scales) are relevant if they map or compare political value structures, determinants, or consequences. By contrast, methodological pieces on missing-data imputation, response biases, or a teamwork SJT are non-relevant unless they explicitly connect to the measurement of political values; similarly, retrospective accounts of DDR participation are only relevant if they analyze value orientations rather than behavior alone. Edge cases include domain-specific attitude scales that may look topical (e.g., “authenticity of asylum claims”): they are relevant only when validated as indicators of broader value constructs (e.g., authoritarianism, outgroup threat) rather than narrow policy opinions.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks an overview of political attitudes, especially in Germany, including how they are defined, measured, and have changed over time. They are interested in East–West differences, youth and migrant attitudes, determinants (e.g., education, authoritarianism), and links to democracy, institutions, and participation, often using surveys like ALLBUS.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly examines, measures, or compares political attitudes of individuals or groups, such as East–West differences in Germany using ALLBUS data, youth views on democracy and trust in institutions, left–right positioning, or attitudes toward minorities and gender equality. Studies that analyze determinants or consequences of political attitudes (e.g., links between authoritarianism and ethnocentrism, effects of political knowledge, migration generation differences, or journalists’ ideological leanings) also qualify, as do DDR-era investigations that explicitly assess ideological attitudes. Comparative political-culture work on other countries or elites can still be relevant when it defines and evaluates attitudes toward political processes and institutions rather than merely describing systems. By contrast, pieces that focus on policy areas (e.g., family policy) or political communication without reporting attitudinal measures, or that only mention “politische Einstellungen” in passing, are non-relevant. Edge cases include handbooks or meta-reviews, which are relevant when they synthesize findings on political attitudes, but not when they are purely methodological or organizational without attitudinal results.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks survey-based data and analyses on political attitudes and participation in Germany—especially among university students, but also youth and the general public. Topics span party preference, left–right ideology, protest behavior, views on democracy and institutions, higher-education politics, foreign and security policy, media use, and demographics.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to “politische einstellungen” if it measures or analyzes people’s political attitudes such as ideological self-placement (e.g., Left–Right scales), party identification or preference, evaluations of politicians and institutions, and positions on concrete issues. Examples that clearly qualify include surveys of students in Köln covering preferences for university political groups and attitudes toward SDS/APO/DKP/ADF, views on emergency laws, banning the NPD, recognition of the GDR, Vietnam, NATO/Wehrdienst, as well as scales on political participation, protest, democracy, and trust. Documents become non-relevant when they only list demographics, media use, consumer behavior, or technical survey variables without linking them to political attitudes or values. Edge cases include mixed-topic datasets: they are still relevant if they explicitly contain constructs like Parteipräferenz, Links–Rechts, or “politische Werte,” but a text where “Einstellungen” means non-political “settings” (e.g., software) or where politics is only mentioned in passing would be non-relevant.</narr>

	<desc>The user needs a survey question to capture respondents’ political orientation by self-placement on a left–right spectrum and to assess their attitudes toward people from various religious groups. They want concise question wording that asks respondents where they would place their own political views on a left–right scale and how they feel about different religious groups.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "politische einstellungen" when it contains explicit material about political attitudes — for example German question wording or survey items that ask respondents to self-place on a left–right scale (terms like "links", "rechts", "Selbsteinstufung", "politische Einstellung"), scale labels or response options, and related attitudinal questions (such as feelings toward religious groups) that are used to measure political orientation. Concrete indicators of relevance include full question text, instructions for respondents, variable codes tied to survey items (e.g. pa01, po01, v54) and descriptions of the measurement instrument or coding scheme. A document is non-relevant if the words appear only as isolated metadata, repeated fragments with no substantive question text, unrelated uses of the same words (e.g. "politische" in a different topic), or if the content is corrupt/spammy and offers no usable survey content or conceptual discussion. Edge cases include codebooks or data dictionaries that only list variable names (which can be relevant if they link to question wording) and OCR'd/transcribed documents with heavy repetition — these may be borderline and require checking for the underlying question text or response categories to confirm relevance.</narr>

	<narr>A document is relevant if it operationalizes or analyzes political attitudes through survey items, validated scales, or pretests, especially within German/European studies. Clear examples include CSES Module 5 (interest, elites, immigrants, redistribution), ESS immigration wording experiments, SECS-GER for social/economic conservatism, KPZ for political cynicism, PEKS for political efficacy, and ALLBUS/FGZ pretests on climate change, antisemitism, and gender equality as political attitude domains. Methodological reports using cognitive interviews, web probing, or psychometric validation are also relevant when they evaluate how political attitudes are measured or interpreted. Non-relevant are general political news or policy descriptions, or projects on social networks or environment that lack explicit attitudinal measures (e.g., LoneCovid network questions without links to political trust/compliance, or purely behavioral environmental indices). Edge cases like DDR participation histories, authority/family-structure scales, or welfare-state opinions qualify when framed as attitudes toward state, authority, or redistribution, but not when they only present demographics or institutional background.</narr>

	<desc>The user seeks research on how political knowledge/sophistication, media consumption, interest, and trust influence political participation through mechanisms like internal political efficacy and civic duty. They want comparative, empirical evidence on how these relationships vary by type of participation (voting, conventional, unconventional) and across groups and contexts (youth, education/class, gender, local vs. national, regions).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “politics” when it substantively addresses political processes, institutions, or behavior—such as studies of political participation (voting, conventional and unconventional action), political knowledge and efficacy, media effects on attitudes, party competition, governance, or political symbolism. Empirical and theoretical works like twin designs testing whether attitudes cause participation, analyses of youth engagement across Europe, the role of political consumerism, or local democracy datasets clearly qualify, as do comparative and formal-model pieces on political trust and participation. Normative or conceptual treatments that define politics, political values, realism vs. idealism, and the culture–politics link are also relevant if they engage with power, authority, or civic action. Edge cases that still count include foreign-language abstracts about political engagement, political geography linking spatial context to behavior, and methodological papers when applied to political outcomes; however, mere incidental mentions of “politics,” workplace “office politics,” or purely methodological/statistical discussions without political application are non-relevant. Documents focused on non-governmental topics (marketing, general sociology, or culture) are non-relevant unless they explicitly tie back to political institutions, actors, or citizen behavior.</narr>

<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking comprehensive surveys and analyses on political attitudes, participation, and culture—especially post‑election developments—along with the role and credibility of traditional and social media, journalist–politician relations, and opinion polls. The information spans multiple countries and groups (e.g., Germany, UK, GDR) and covers voting behavior, trust in institutions, extremism, women and youth engagement, and political socialization with detailed demographics.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it substantively addresses politics as civic life and institutions—e.g., post‑election developments, citizens’ trust in parties and leaders, voting behavior and left–right self‑placement, political participation, or the role and influence of media and social networks on democracy and opinion formation. Empirical surveys and studies that measure political attitudes, media trust, opinion polls, journalist–politician relations, or demographic correlates of political behavior (such as youth, students, or women’s political engagement) are strong matches. Historical or country‑specific analyses that frame issues as political—like estimates of political prisoners in the GDR, foreign policy views, or satisfaction with democracy—are also relevant. By contrast, items that use “politics” metaphorically (office politics), general media usage without a political dimension, or purely technical/social media platform discussions without political information behavior are non‑relevant. Edge cases include education or culture studies: they are relevant only if they assess political knowledge, civic education, or college politics; otherwise they fall outside the scope.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for survey questions and measures about political parties and political engagement. Specifically they want items on whether parties are necessary, frequency of political discussion (in class/friends), political interest and participation, influence of politics on one's life, sources of political information, and preferences for the ideal party's characteristics.</desc>
	<narr>This document is highly relevant to the keyword "politics" because it contains many survey questions and items explicitly about political parties, political discussion frequency, political interest/participation, and how politics influences respondents’ lives. For example, it asks respondents to rate whether parties are necessary on a 1–5 scale, whether parties encourage political activity, how often politics is discussed in class, and what an ideal party would look like. However, the text is noisy and repetitive (many duplicated lines, item codes like A3014/C3036, and a COUNTRY placeholder), which can create false positives in retrieval systems or make it less useful for users seeking polished analysis or news. It would be less relevant if the user wanted policy analysis, current events, or detailed country-specific information rather than raw survey instrument content or metadata.</narr>

<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is looking for resources on measuring political attitudes and behaviors, including validated short scales for efficacy, participation, cynicism, conservatism, national pride, system satisfaction, and partisan identity. They also seek methodological guidance on using web tracking data and insights from research on social media’s effects on democracy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “politics” when it directly examines political behavior, attitudes, systems, or participation—for example, descriptions and validations of scales like Political Efficacy (PESS/PEKS), Left–Right Self-Placement, political cynicism, conservatism (SECS), satisfaction with the political system (SPS), or partisan identity. Content that analyzes how media and technology shape democracy and political communication, such as an interview summarizing research on social media’s effects on polarization and misinformation, is also clearly relevant. Methodological discussions remain relevant when they are applied to political constructs (e.g., psychometric validity, cross-national invariance for political measures, or web tracking used to study news use and political participation), but would be less relevant if they focused solely on technical procedures (like translation methods or software implementation) without a political application. Edge cases include topics like national pride or epistemology that become political when tied to regime legitimacy, discrimination, or public policy debates—these count if the political linkage is explicit. By contrast, documents that only mention “politics” in passing, treat “politics” as office dynamics, or discuss web tracking/health information without any political angle would be non-relevant.</narr>

<title>political trust</title>
<publication>
	<desc>Find scholarly research on political trust—how it is conceptualized and measured, how it varies across countries and over time, and what drives it (e.g., government performance, corruption, inequality perceptions, justice, social capital, issue salience). Also examine how political trust affects participation, media trust, and conspiracy beliefs, and how these relationships differ by context and period.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly examines trust in political institutions (e.g., government, parliament, courts, police) by defining, measuring, or modeling “political trust,” its trends, determinants, or consequences. Strong signals include use of cross-national surveys (WVS/EVS/ESS/Eurobarometer), analyses of performance, corruption, inequality, social capital, or links to behaviors like voting, protest, or direct action, as well as studies tying media trust to political trust (the “trust nexus”). Methodological work that interrogates how political trust is measured or compared across countries (e.g., unidimensionality, Rasch modeling, equivalence) is also relevant because it shapes interpretation of findings. Non-relevant items discuss “trust” only in non-political domains (interpersonal or brand trust) or mention political topics without analyzing trust, or cover media trust without connecting it to trust in political institutions. Edge cases are relevant when they clearly center institutional trust—such as emigrants’ trust in homeland institutions, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs explained by political trust, or effects of direct democracy on trust—while standalone media-trust pieces or generic participation studies without a trust component are only partially relevant.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking survey data and analyses on political trust—confidence in institutions, parties, politicians, and democracy—alongside electoral behavior and policy attitudes. They aim to compare levels, trends, and determinants of political trust across countries and over time using rich, demographically detailed datasets.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query “political trust” if it measures or discusses trust or confidence in political institutions, actors, processes, or regimes (e.g., parliament, government, courts, police, political parties and leaders, presidents/prime ministers, and international organizations like the EU, NATO, OSCE, and the UN). The paragraph contains many such examples: surveys listing “trust in institutions and political leaders,” “political trust,” “trust in the Senator,” “trust in democracy and politics,” or item batteries on trust in parliament, government, judiciary, and parties, as well as “most trusted/least trusted institution” and trust in NATO/EU/UN. Social cohesion or moral-orientation studies are also relevant when they include institutional trust at local, regional, or federal levels; by contrast, measures of generalized interpersonal trust (“trust in fellow citizens”) are only tangential unless explicitly linked to political institutions. Documents that focus solely on electoral behavior, party preference, media consumption, economic conditions, or demographics without any trust/confidence items are non-relevant. Edge cases that still count include historical or regime-specific “confidence” questions (e.g., trust in SED leadership or Gorbachev), and phrasing such as “confidence,” “most/least trusted politician/institution,” or “trusted source of political news” when these refer to political actors or institutions.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A survey-style query asking whether respondents tend to trust political parties (or not) and their level of trust in politicians. It also asks which sources of information about political matters they trust most (first and second choices) and which EU countries they consider politically trustworthy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "political trust" when it explicitly addresses trust in political actors, institutions, or information sources — for example items in the paragraph that ask whether people trust political parties or politicians, or which EU countries (Germany, UK, Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal) are seen as politically trustworthy. Survey instruments or results are especially relevant (QA5A/QA5B, Q57A, v211–v224 codes) because they show measured choices like experts, journalists, NGOs, bloggers, business leaders, friends/family, or “none/don’t know.” A document is non‑relevant if it contains only unrelated identifiers, boilerplate, or noise (repeated question text or stray variable codes) without substantive responses, or if it discusses “trust” solely in a non‑political context. Edge cases include options such as “NONE” or “OTHER SPONT” which are short but important survey responses that require interpretation, and overlapping categories (e.g. business leaders or NGOs) that may be tangentially political and need judgement to decide relevance.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is looking for validated survey instruments to measure political trust and closely related constructs, with details on scale structure, reliability/validity, and cross-national comparability. They want short, practical measures suitable for time-limited questionnaires (e.g., social/interpersonal trust, political efficacy, cynicism, and system satisfaction).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly addresses citizens’ trust in political institutions, authorities, or the political system, including definitions, determinants, trends, or measurement (e.g., scales of political cynicism, satisfaction with the political system, or external political efficacy as responsiveness of the system). Content about political cynicism (KPZ), political system satisfaction (SPS), or links between transparency and trust in institutions would count as relevant, as would validated short measures of political trust or distrust across countries. By contrast, materials focused on interpersonal or generalized social trust (e.g., KUSIV3, ESS social trust), organizational trust in employee–superior relationships, participation behavior, ideology (e.g., conservatism scales), national pride, or immigration attitudes are non-relevant unless they explicitly tie those constructs to trust in political institutions. Edge cases include studies on “trust” that do not specify the political target, or methodological papers whose validation is about non-political trust; these are not relevant, while cross-national validation of political-trust constructs would be. For example, an ESS module on generalized social trust is non-relevant unless it includes items like trust in parliament or government, whereas short scales capturing political cynicism or system satisfaction are directly relevant.</narr>

<title>political interest</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The query seeks research on the determinants, development, and group differences in political interest—especially among immigrants and youth in Germany/Europe—including how integration, discrimination, national identification, education, class, gender, and mental health shape interest (including transnational interest) and, in turn, political participation. It also looks for evidence on macro-level variation in political interest over time and contexts.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly examines “political interest” as an attitudinal construct—how much people are interested in politics—by defining or measuring it (e.g., survey items on interest in politics, macrointerest indices), analyzing its determinants (education, integration, discrimination, gender, class), or linking it to behaviors like voting and party activity. Studies that explicitly model political interest in specific populations (e.g., immigrants in Germany, adolescents in CILS4EU, gender differences, transnational interest in German vs. Turkish politics) or compare contexts over time or across countries are clearly relevant. Papers that focus primarily on adjacent constructs (political efficacy, participation) are relevant only if they include political interest as a distinct variable or outcome; if efficacy or participation is discussed without measuring interest, they are marginal. Non-relevant items use “interest” in other senses—public interests in global governance, business interests, interest groups, or economic interest rates—even if they are about politics. Edge cases include brief mentions of “interest in politics” without operationalization (weakly relevant) and studies of “apathy” or “political discussions” that serve as proxies for interest (potentially relevant if tied to an interest measure).</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks studies and survey data that measure political interest (levels, topics followed, and information sources) and analyze how it varies across demographics and contexts. They want to understand its links to participation and attitudes toward parties, elites, gender equality, and key policy issues.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly measures, describes, or analyzes individuals’ political interest—such as levels of interest in politics, interest in specific political topics, changes over time, or determinants like education, region, gender, and media use. Examples include surveys of women’s interest in politics, students’ political interest, “extent to which informed,” frequency of political discussions, sources used for political information, and interest in election campaigns or results. It is also relevant when political interest appears as a variable within broader studies of participation, ideology, or socialization (e.g., parental political interest, left–right self-placement with an interest measure, comparisons across GDR/FRG or UK). Non-relevant cases include uses of “interest” that mean special interest groups, party interests, or economic interest rates, as well as documents listing non-political interests (music/TV genres) without linking them to political information behavior, or analyses of politics that never address interest levels. Edge cases: brief or metadata-only mentions of “political interest” can still be relevant; conversely, pieces on equal rights or European integration are relevant only if they include an explicit measure of interest in politics or elections, and country- or period-specific studies remain relevant if they assess individuals’ political interest.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for standard survey question wordings and response options used to measure individuals' interest in politics — for example, graded questions like "How interested would you say you are in politics?" or binary items like "Are you interested in politics? (Yes/No)," and variations distinguishing active participation from passive following. They want examples and phrasing used in surveys to classify respondents' political engagement.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "political interest" when it explicitly measures or discusses people's interest in politics — for example survey question wording like "How interested would you say you are in politics?", "Are you interested in politics? 1 Yes 2 No", items contrasting active participation vs. passive following, response scales, or metadata that clearly links codes (v186, Q54, FR33) to those question texts. The repeated lines and question codes in the paragraph are relevant because they contain the exact phrasings and response options used to gauge political interest, and items about following foreign political problems or levels of interest are also on-topic. A document is non-relevant when it discusses unrelated meanings of "interest" (e.g., financial interest), addresses specific policies or actors without measuring personal political engagement, or consists only of isolated codes with no question wording. Edge cases include partial matches (mentions of "interest" without "politics" are not relevant), documents in other languages or abbreviated forms that nevertheless include the core question wording (still relevant), and noisy duplicates or repeated codes which are redundant but not disqualifying if the substantive question text is present.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is looking for ways to measure political interest, especially brief validated survey scales and their psychometric properties. They may also seek related measures (e.g., efficacy, participation, cynicism) and methodological guides (web/mobile tracking, Google Trends) for studying political engagement.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it defines, measures, or analyzes political interest as a construct (e.g., a two-item scale capturing respondents’ interest in politics, its reliability/validity, or its links to participation). Methods pieces can be relevant when they use digital traces to infer political interest specifically, such as web or mobile tracking of political news consumption or Google Trends queries about political topics. Content on adjacent constructs (political efficacy, participation, cynicism, pride, left–right self-placement) is only relevant when it explicitly examines their relationship to political interest or uses a political-interest measure as a variable; otherwise it’s peripheral. Items about “interest” in non-political domains (e.g., leisure interests) or general “public interest” without a political focus are non-relevant, as are broad interviews on social media and democracy that don’t address political interest. Edge cases include documents using proxies like “engagement,” “attention,” or search volume that must be clearly tied to political topics, and uses of “interest” meaning financial interest rates or “interest groups,” which are off-target.</narr>

<title>political efficacy</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks research-based information on political efficacy—definitions of internal vs. external efficacy, how it is measured, and its role as a mediator/predictor of political participation. They likely want empirical findings on determinants (e.g., political knowledge, media use, deliberation, gender, institutions) and cross-national patterns.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly engages with political efficacy—especially internal (citizens’ perceived competence to influence politics) and external (perceived government responsiveness)—by defining it, measuring it, or testing its antecedents and consequences. Highly relevant examples include studies showing that political knowledge or media use increases internal efficacy and thereby participation, validations of efficacy scales (e.g., PESS or PPSE), cross-national trends or gaps (gender, education, income) in ISSP/EVS/CSES data, or institutional analyses linking direct democracy or government alternation to external efficacy. Methods-focused papers remain relevant when they model efficacy as a mediator or moderator of participation (e.g., mediated regressions, SEM, twin designs) or assess measurement invariance across countries. Non-relevant items include uses of “efficacy” in non-political domains (medical or instructional efficacy), discussions of participation or democracy that never theorize or measure efficacy, or pieces about “political efficiency” or government effectiveness rather than perceptions of influence or responsiveness. Edge cases: work on “democratic efficacy” or “self-efficacy” counts only if explicitly tied to internal/external political efficacy; papers that mention efficacy in passing without constructs, items, or analyses should be treated as only weakly relevant.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks definitions and measures of political efficacy—especially internal and external efficacy—and where these are captured in social surveys. It aims to identify relevant datasets and survey items (e.g., German Internet Panel, Eurobarometer, EU studies) to analyze citizens’ perceived influence and understanding of politics and their links to participation and attitudes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it measures or discusses political efficacy—typically internal efficacy (one’s ability to understand politics and participate) and external efficacy (belief that politicians/government are responsive to citizens). Clear signals include survey items such as “I have a good understanding of important political issues,” “politicians care what ordinary people think,” or “politicians strive for close contact with the population,” as well as explicit mentions of “internal/external political efficacy,” “political effectiveness” (as a synonym), or EU-specific variants (e.g., efficacy regarding EU institutions). Study descriptions, scales, experimental manipulations, or results from panels and election studies (e.g., German Internet Panel, Eurobarometer, voting advice applications) that report these constructs also count as relevant. By contrast, documents about self-efficacy in non-political domains (teacher self-efficacy, parental self-efficacy, program efficacy, or “efficacy” of a training/intervention) are non-relevant even though they contain the word “efficacy.” Edge cases include uses of “effectiveness” that refer to party/government performance (not relevant) versus citizen perceived “responsivity,” “influence,” or “ability to assess political issues” (relevant).</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>A search for "political efficacy" seeks a definition and ways it is measured — specifically an individual's belief they can understand and influence politics and that the political system will respond. Typical survey indicators include perceived influence of politics on one’s life, frequency of political discussion (class/friends), political interest and participation, beliefs about parties' role, and measures of political information or civic self‑efficacy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "political efficacy" when it directly measures people’s perceived ability to influence politics (internal efficacy) or their beliefs about the responsiveness of political institutions (external efficacy) — for example explicit labels like "SELBSTB Scale Self efficacy," items asking "How much is your life influenced by politics," or questions about whether people participate in politics or follow it with interest. In the paragraph above, entries such as "SELBSTB Scale Self efficacy," "Do you participate in political activities or do you follow politics with interest," and the item asking where you place yourself on whether parties are necessary are relevant because they tap perceived influence or capability. Content that focuses on party preferences or ideal party characteristics (repeated "WHAT WOULD THE IDEAL POLITICAL PARTY BE LIKE" pairs), metadata, variable codes, and repeated placeholders like "POLITICAL INFORMATION ITEM" without substantive wording are non‑relevant. Edge cases include political interest or participation questions, which may serve as useful correlates or proxies for efficacy but do not directly measure the belief "I can influence politics," and normative items such as "political parties encourage people to become active" which reflect beliefs about others rather than self‑efficacy. Prefer documents with explicit efficacy wording, scale response options, or items about personal influence or system responsiveness; deprioritize administrative text, party ideology items, and unlabeled information placeholders.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user wants to understand political efficacy—especially the distinction between internal and external efficacy—and how it is measured. They are seeking brief, validated scales and evidence on their reliability, validity, and cross-cultural comparability.</desc>
	<narr>Documents are relevant when they define political efficacy (especially the distinction between internal and external efficacy) and/or present, adapt, or validate instruments that measure it in political contexts. Highly relevant examples include scale descriptions and psychometric evaluations of PESS/PEKS or Perceived Political Self-Efficacy (PPSE), evidence of reliability/validity, incremental validity for predicting political participation, translation procedures (e.g., TRAPD), and cross-national measurement invariance. Papers on self-efficacy in non-political domains (environmental, occupational, academic, mobbing) or on general self-efficacy are only tangential unless they explicitly link efficacy to political beliefs or behaviors; similarly, measures of political attitudes like cynicism, left-right placement, national pride, or system satisfaction are related but not about efficacy. Methodological critiques of political efficacy measures, short-form versus full-scale comparisons, and discussions of construct and criterion validity are within scope. Edge cases include cross-cultural adaptations and survey design constraints (short scales), which are relevant if they concern political efficacy specifically; mentions of “efficacy” that refer to effectiveness broadly or to participation behaviors without the belief component are non-relevant.</narr>

<title>corona</title>
<publication>
	<desc>Information about the COVID-19 (“corona”) pandemic’s societal, economic, and political impacts, with emphasis on German surveys and policy responses alongside effects in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa and links to Brexit. Topics include mental health, work and childcare, education, rule compliance, and outcomes for vulnerable groups.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it uses “corona” to refer to the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, including substantive discussion of public health measures, social and economic impacts, surveys or studies (e.g., a “Corona Study” on Germany), or analyses of behavior, mental health, education, and policy during the corona crisis. Articles that link other topics (such as Brexit, African trade, or EU politics) to pandemic effects are also relevant when the pandemic is a main focus rather than a brief aside. Non-relevant cases include uses of “corona” with different meanings (solar corona in astronomy, electrical corona discharge, Corona beer, place names like Corona, California) or appearances only as part of unrelated words (coronation, coronary). Edge cases: capitalized “Corona” in German typically denotes COVID-19 and is relevant; pieces that use only “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2” without the word “corona” can still match the user intent; protests or “Corona rules” discussions are relevant if they substantively address the pandemic. Documents that merely name-drop “corona” without analysis, or historical comparisons (e.g., SARS 2003) that don’t tie back to the current pandemic, should be considered weakly relevant or non-relevant.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user is seeking representative survey data and analyses on the COVID-19 (corona) pandemic in Germany, covering public attitudes, trust in institutions and science, evaluation of government measures, risk perception, information behavior, and adoption of the Corona-Warn-App with demographics. This includes repeated polls and panel studies (e.g., forsa, Science Barometer, Mannheim Corona Study) conducted in 2020 tracking concerns, behaviors, and political views.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it addresses the coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic (often called “corona,” especially in German contexts), such as public opinion, policy measures, science communication, or behaviors during the crisis. Concrete matches include representative surveys or studies like the Science Barometer Corona Special, forsa’s government-commissioned polls, or the Mannheim Corona Study that cover topics such as trust in science, assessment of restrictions, mask mandates, vaccination willingness, and use of the Corona-Warn-App, including their questionnaires, demographic breakdowns, and weighting details. Technical materials that primarily list question batteries, methodology, or coded variables are still relevant when they are explicitly tied to corona-related attitudes or behaviors. Non-relevant items use “corona” in other senses (e.g., solar corona, electrical corona discharge, dental “coronal,” the beer brand, or place names like Corona, California). Edge cases include documents about the pandemic that use only terms like COVID-19 or SARS‑CoV‑2 (still relevant by topic), whereas pieces that merely name-drop “corona” without substantive discussion should be treated as non-relevant.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>Wanting an overview of public attitudes and impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in Germany — how people perceive infection risks, government measures and restrictions, and their effects on health, finances, schools, healthcare capacity, masks and tracing apps, travel/borders, protests, EU and rescue packages, and willingness to vaccinate.</desc>
	<narr>This document is relevant to the keyword "corona" because it explicitly discusses the coronavirus pandemic using direct terms and German compounds (e.g., Corona, Coronavirus, CoronaKrise, CoronaMaßnahmen) and covers many core topics such as infections, public-health measures (masks, apps, lockdowns), vaccination, schools, economic relief, and regional policy responses. Concrete signals of high relevance include named events and actors (Trump infected, Tönnies outbreak), specific policies (mask mandates, contact‑tracing app), and temporal markers (week numbers) that show it is focused on COVID‑19 developments. It would be non‑relevant if the same token "corona" appears with a different meaning (solar corona, Corona beer, the Ford Corona automobile, corona discharge in physics, or a person’s surname) or only as an incidental string in unrelated content. Edge cases include partially relevant documents that discuss economic or political effects without explicit reference to the virus (these are somewhat relevant), concatenated German compounds or misspellings (e.g., CoronaKrise, CoronaMaßnahmen) which should be treated as matches, and materials that mention COVID topics but are fictional, satirical, or conspiratorial, which may be lower quality despite keyword overlap.</narr>

They want details on the scale’s purpose, structure, target age, and its application to German elementary students in 2020–2021.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if “corona” refers to the coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic (including synonyms like SARS-CoV-2) and discusses its effects, measures, research, or experiences. The paragraph is relevant because it explicitly links a children’s fear scale to the corona pandemic in 2020–2021 and describes a questionnaire administered in German elementary schools. Non-relevant items would use “corona” in unrelated senses, such as the solar corona, electrical corona discharge, dental/anatomical terms (e.g., corona radiata), the Corona beer brand, or place names like Corona, California. Edge cases include occurrences where “corona” is only a substring (coronation, coronal) or titles that include “corona” but concern unrelated topics; these should be excluded unless the surrounding context clearly involves the pandemic. Conversely, documents that say “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2” without the exact word “corona” may still be relevant if query expansion is allowed.</narr>

<title>politikverdrossenheit</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an evidence-based overview of Politikverdrossenheit (political disaffection) in Germany—its definitions and dimensions, measurement and trends, and differences between East/West and youth/adults. They also want research on causes (trust, media, socio-economic and socialization factors), consequences for voting behavior (including support for extremist parties), and potential remedies such as political education, e-government, and direct democracy.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly defines or analyzes Politikverdrossenheit (e.g., disinterest, distrust of politicians, low democracy satisfaction), breaks it into dimensions, or compares its levels across groups or regions, such as youth versus adults or East versus West Germany, ideally using surveys like ALLBUS or the European Social Survey. Studies that test causes or consequences count as relevant, for example showing an interaction between right-wing attitudes and disillusionment in voting for the Republikaner, linking negative media coverage to higher disaffection, or evaluating whether e-democracy or direct democracy alleviates it. Conceptual clarifications, synonyms (e.g., Parteienverdrossenheit), and frameworks like Easton’s political support or the polity–politics–policy triad, as well as implications for political education, also indicate relevance. Non-relevant are pieces that only name the term in passing, discuss mediatization or voter behavior without connecting to political disillusionment, or focus on other countries without linking disaffection to outcomes; by contrast, a French politics analysis that ties party dynamics to rising disillusionment would still be relevant. Edge cases include normative essays arguing disillusionment is “normal” (relevant if they explain mechanisms) and studies measuring trust or democracy satisfaction without the label “Politikverdrossenheit” (potentially relevant if they operationalize its components).</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The query seeks empirical studies and survey data on Politikverdrossenheit (political disaffection) in Germany—its definitions, causes, and typical triggers, especially during the COVID-19 period. It focuses on factors like migration, globalization, digitalization, media use and credibility, conspiracy beliefs, values, trust in institutions, democracy attitudes, demographics, and political participation, and how these are measured in representative surveys.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly examines, measures, or explains Politikverdrossenheit (political disaffection), for example by presenting survey scales, determinants, and contexts in Germany. This passage is highly relevant because it includes a 2020 COVID-era study on causes of disaffection (e.g., perceived threats from migration, digitization, globalization), details on sampling and instruments, and multiple batteries that explicitly label “Politikverdrossenheit” alongside close proxies such as political efficacy, democracy satisfaction, trust in institutions, media credibility, and conspiracy beliefs. Youth and election studies that include items like “parties only want votes,” “citizens have little influence,” or “parties use the state as a self‑service shop” also qualify as relevant operationalizations. Non‑relevant content would be lists or metadata that never touch political disaffection, or sections about unrelated topics (e.g., housing or consumption) without linking them to cynicism/disengagement. Edge cases include documents that mention the term only once: they become relevant if they offer measures, findings, or conceptualization, and may also be relevant when using synonyms (political cynicism, disengagement) that clearly map to Politikverdrossenheit.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants a concise paragraph explaining the German term "Politikverdrossenheit" (political disillusionment or apathy), including what it means, common causes, and its effects on civic participation. They likely need a short explanatory text suitable for an essay, article, or assignment.</desc>
	<narr>Documents are relevant to the query "politikverdrossenheit" when they directly address political disaffection or apathy—explaining causes (e.g., corruption scandals, broken campaign promises, or economic inequality), describing manifestations (declining trust in parties, protest voting, youth disengagement, or falling turnout), or presenting measurements such as surveys and longitudinal studies. Relevant examples include empirical research on voter trust, news reports of a spike in non-voting after a scandal, policy analyses proposing re-engagement strategies, and comparative studies of political cynicism in Germany and other countries. Documents are not relevant when they only use the word in passing, focus on unrelated political topics (e.g., policy details without discussing attitudes), are purely promotional or spam, or treat "politics" in a generic sense without linking to disillusionment or participation. Edge cases include articles on low turnout that are relevant only if they connect turnout to attitudes; historical accounts are relevant if they trace causes or trends in disenchantment; and pieces using synonyms like "political apathy" or translations are relevant provided the conceptual link is clear.</narr>

	<desc>The user is looking for a clear definition and overview of "Politikverdrossenheit" (political disaffection/cynicism), including its causes, consequences, and how it differs from related concepts. They also likely want information on how it is measured in surveys—e.g., the AUTNES short scale of political cynicism (KPZ)—and details about the scale’s theoretical basis and psychometric quality.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "politikverdrossenheit" if it directly addresses political disaffection or cynicism — for example definitions, survey instruments (like the Kurzskala politischer Zynismus, KPZ), item wordings, sampling procedures, and psychometric results used to measure general mistrust of political authorities. Relevant examples include AUTNES reports describing the KPZ, papers evaluating its reliability and validity, or studies linking political cynicism to turnout and trust in institutions. Documents that discuss related constructs such as political apathy, alienation, or distrust can be partially relevant if they explicitly connect those concepts to measurement or to the same generalized skepticism toward officeholders. Non-relevant documents would be those that merely use the term metaphorically, focus on unrelated policy topics, or discuss cynicism in a purely philosophical or literary sense without empirical measurement. Edge cases include texts in other languages (German-language sources are often highly relevant), papers that only mention KPZ in passing, and studies that examine individual personality cynicism rather than system-directed politikverdrossenheit, which may be only tangentially useful.</narr>

<title>psychische gesundheit</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The user seeks an evidence-based overview of mental health, focusing on how social, economic, and environmental stressors (war, unemployment, migration, social media, workplace conditions, COVID-19, caregiving, incarceration) impact different populations. They want findings on prevalence, causal pathways, and effective prevention, treatment, and policy/intervention strategies.</desc>
	<narr>For the query “psychische gesundheit,” a document is relevant if it substantively addresses mental health outcomes, symptoms, wellbeing, services, or determinants, using concrete indicators or measures (e.g., depression, anxiety, psychische Symptome, Wohlbefinden) and discussing evidence, prevalence, interventions, or policy. Examples of strong matches include analyses of war-related mental health impacts in Ukraine, meta-analyses on unemployment or caregiving and mental health, pandemic studies on children’s psychological distress, workplace reports on psychische Belastungen, or research on social media comparisons and mental wellbeing. Documents are less relevant if they focus mainly on physical health or organizational topics and mention mental health only in passing, or if “Gesundheit” is treated broadly without specific psychological content. Edge cases that still count as relevant include sociological or resilience frameworks (e.g., Kohärenzgefühl, social exclusion/identity theory, JD-R in prisons) when they employ mental health indicators or outcomes; by contrast, purely conceptual discussions of health systems that name “psychische” without data or concrete implications for mental health are marginal. Use of related German terms (psychische Erkrankungen, psychosomatisch, Lebenszufriedenheit as a mental-health proxy) and the presence of quantitative findings (effect sizes, rates, longitudinal evidence) further increase relevance.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>The user seeks information on mental health (psychological wellbeing), including how it is measured and its prevalence, determinants, and outcomes in population studies. Focus is on EU/German surveys covering coping, stress, depression, help-seeking, social support, substance use, and public attitudes/stigma.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly addresses mental health, such as modules on “psychisches Wohlbefinden,” measures of depression or anxiety, scales of psychological functioning (e.g., self-efficacy, coping, loneliness), or use of mental health services (psychotherapy, psychotropic medication, psychiatric hospitalization). Survey descriptions that assess attitudes toward people with mental or emotional problems, parental reports on children’s mental state, or self-assessed psychological health also qualify, even when embedded in broader public health or social surveys. By contrast, content focused on unrelated topics like telecommunications, energy policy, agriculture, or general internet usage without a mental-health component is non-relevant. Edge cases include general health studies that include both physical and psychological scales (still relevant), substance-use surveys that also capture mental disorders (relevant), or documents that mention “psychische Störung” only in a discrimination checklist without further mental-health detail (marginal relevance). Synonymous German terms such as “psychische Befindlichkeit,” “psychische Verfassung,” and “psychische Erkrankung” should be treated as matches for the query “psychische gesundheit.”</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user is looking for survey-style information on mental (psychological) health—specifically measures and questions about recent treatment for psychological problems, exposure to work-related psychological stressors, work-caused or -worsened health issues, and self-rated overall health and perceived health risks (e.g., from COVID-19 or BSE).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "psychische gesundheit" if it explicitly addresses mental or psychological health (German terms like psychisch, seelisch, psychische Gesundheit), mental-health treatment, psychiatric care, self-rated mental wellbeing, or psychosocial stressors (for example, "Waren Sie während der letzten 12 Monate wegen eines psychischen oder seelischen Problems in Behandlung" or "Sind Sie bei Ihrer Arbeit psychisch belastenden Faktoren ausgesetzt"). Items asking whether work caused or worsened physical or psychological problems are also highly relevant because they link occupational exposures to mental health outcomes. Documents that focus only on general physical health, infectious disease risk perceptions (BSE, Coronavirus) or on metadata/codes without substantive mental-health content are not relevant unless they explicitly discuss psychological impacts (e.g., anxiety about COVID-19). Edge cases include ambiguous questions like "Gesundheitszustand" with no mental/physical qualifier (partially relevant depending on context), mentions of "psychisch" in non-clinical idioms, or long multi-topic surveys where mental-health items are present but rare — these should be scored as partially relevant unless mental-health content is prominent. Finally, repeated or duplicated lines (codes or verbatim repeats) do not increase relevance beyond the substantive mental-health items they contain.</narr>

	<desc>The user is seeking German resources on mental health that focus on the development and validation of survey instruments (e.g., psychosocial safety climate, flourishing, irritation, anxiety, work addiction) used in workplaces and population studies, including Covid-19 impacts. They want details on questionnaire pretests and measures for assessing well-being, symptoms, physical activity, healthcare seeking, and occupational factors.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it directly addresses mental health (psychische Gesundheit) outcomes, determinants, protection, or measurement—e.g., organizational policies like Psychosocial Safety Climate (PSC), COVID-19 effects on mental health (LoneCovid), or psychometric tools for depression, anxiety, irritation, psychosomatic complaints, work addiction, and the Human Flourishing Scale’s mental health dimension. Content that links job characteristics, stress models (e.g., Lazarus), or workplace wellbeing screening (e.g., BOKX) to psychological health is also clearly relevant. Edge cases include studies on healthcare seeking or symptom interpretation that are relevant only when they assess psychological complaints or attributions, and topics like idiopathic environmental intolerance which straddle physical and psychological domains. Documents focusing solely on physical activity or active transport, general patient satisfaction with visits, or demographic surveys are non-relevant unless they explicitly tie these to mental health outcomes. Given the German query, materials using terms such as psychische Gesundheit, psychological wellbeing, psychological distress, or psychosocial safety in German context increase relevance.</narr>

<title>linksrechtsskala</title>
<publication>
	<desc>The searcher wants a clear definition and practical overview of the "links–rechts–skala" (left–right political self‑placement scale), including how it is measured and used in surveys and research. They are likely seeking information on different scale formats and orientations, validity and interpretation issues, and the scale's relevance for groups like young people and cross‑national comparisons.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "linksrechtsskala" when it explicitly treats the left–right political scale (e.g., mentions "LinksRechtsSkala", "left–right scale", or gives self‑placement items such as "0 = left, 10 = right"), reports empirical results from such scales, or analyzes how that scale is constructed, presented, or interpreted (for example questionnaire experiments varying horizontal/vertical orientation, youth interviews about what "left" and "right" mean, or manifesto-based left–right positionings). Sections that compare ideological dimensions (economic vs. socio‑cultural left–right axes), present typologies of political positioning, or use comparative party/program data to derive left–right scores are clearly relevant. Documents are not relevant when they discuss voting, turnout, or social structure without any left–right measure, or when "links" or "rechts" appear in non‑ideological senses (e.g., anatomical left/right, web links, or legal "Recht") and do not address political positioning. Edge cases include studies that measure related concepts (political interest, trust, or partisanship) and report left–right only as a background variable—these are partially relevant if they provide the actual scale items or analysis, but less so if they only use the label without detail.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>A variable capturing ideological position on a left–right continuum — either respondents' self-placement or coders' placement of parties/programmes — used to measure political orientation across surveys (e.g., Eurobarometer, ALLBUS, national election studies, manifesto codings). Researchers use it to analyze party positions, vote choice, policy preferences, and trends in political ideology.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it explicitly contains a left–right (Links–Rechts) scale or variables about left–right placement — for example survey items labeled "LinksRechtsSkala", "Selbsteinstufung auf einem Links–Rechts-Kontinuum", party positions coded on a left–right dimension, or dataset fields showing party or respondent placement on a left–right scale (e.g. EMCS/Euromanifesto, EES, ALLBUS, ESS modules with LinksRechts variables). Good examples of relevant records are codebooks and datasets that list "Einstufung der Parteien ... auf einem LinksRechtsKontinuum", "Selbsteinstufung LinksRechts", or "LinksRechtsPositionen der Partei" as actual variables. Non‑relevant documents either lack any left–right measure (only list other scales such as authoritarian/liberal, pro/anti‑EU, or issue indices) or use the tokens "links" or "right" in unrelated senses (hyperlinks, legal "Rechts", directional "right"), which are false positives. Edge cases include multilingual or concatenated spellings (LinksRechts, Links–Rechts, LinksRechtsSkala) — these should be treated as relevant — and texts that discuss left–right ideology only conceptually (no variable or coded measure), which are borderline: useful for background but not for variable extraction.</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>The user wants a clear explanation of the "left–right scale" used in political surveys — what it measures and how respondents, parties and politicians are asked to place themselves. They also need to know common implementations and coding (e.g., 0–10, 1–11 or 1–5 "thermometer" formats), plus how missing/"don't know" responses and wave-specific variations are handled.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant if it contains survey questions, codebooks, or questionnaires that ask respondents to place themselves, parties, or politicians on a left–right political scale (e.g., self-placement items, party placement such as SPD/CDU/FDP/CSU/Greens, or politician ratings like Helmut Kohl or Oskar Lafontaine). Relevant documents typically show the exact scale format and wording (examples: 1–11 scales, 0–10 thermometers, 1–5 follow‑up thermometers, or two‑step left/middle/right plus intensity), response codes (e.g. 01..11, 98/99/00, KA/no answer) and variable labels (F35, F30, F31, FIV31, etc.) or wave-specific instructions. Non‑relevant texts are those that use the words “links” or “rechts” in other senses (hyperlinks, legal “rechts,” spatial directions) or general political commentary that does not include a measurement instrument or scale item. Edge cases include documents that merely mention left–right ideology without showing the response categories (lower relevance), translations or summaries of questionnaires (may be partially relevant), and telephone‑survey notes that omit visual thermometers or change coding across waves — these require careful inspection to confirm they capture the scale information sought.</narr>

	<desc>User wants a concise explanation of the "left–right scale" (Links-Rechts-Skala) as used in the PAWCER pretests: what it measures, how it is operationalized, and how it was tested. Specifically, they need to know that the scale maps respondents' ideological profiles across four subdimensions (economic libertarianism, conservatism, socialism, liberalism) by assigning scores to each dimension to enable individual and group comparisons, and that these questions were evaluated using face-to-face cognitive interviews.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "linksrechtsskala" when it explicitly treats the Left–Right scale as an instrument — describing its operationalization, scoring and use (for example the four subdimensions: economic libertarianism, conservatism, socialism and liberalism), its application in cross‑national surveys such as PAWCER or the Values in Crisis study, or the pretest methods used (e.g. cognitive interviews, personally administered interviews). Concrete implementation details (question wording, subdimension items, scoring rules, translations or country versions) and empirical uses (comparisons of ideological profiles, links to welfare or climate attitudes) make a document especially relevant. Documents are non‑relevant if they only mention "left" or "right" rhetorically, treat left/right in nonpolitical senses (traffic, anatomy), or report a simple single‑item self‑placement without engaging the multidimensional LinksRechtsSkala or its measurement properties. Borderline cases include related two‑axis instruments (like the Political Compass) or theoretical discussions of ideology: these are partially relevant when they map economic and sociocultural dimensions or compare measurement approaches, but less so if they never address the specific subdimension structure or survey implementation.</narr>

<title>linksrechts</title>
<publication>
	<desc>Looking for research and empirical evidence on what Germans mean by the political labels "left" and "right" — which coherent conceptions exist (e.g., economic, cultural, system-oriented or emotional) and how social-structural factors (education, class, age, East/West region) shape those associations. Also want studies using ALLBUS and similar surveys on measurement issues (e.g., middle category), how meanings changed over time, and the implications for voting behavior and political participation.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "linksrechts" when it substantively treats the political left–right dimension — for example, analyses of left/right self‑placement, semantic associations with "links" and "rechts," survey results (ALLBUS, Politbarometer, ISSP), measurement methods (e.g., correspondence analysis like CAGalt), or how social structure (education, region, age, class) shapes left–right concepts. Concrete signals of relevance are discussion of ideological concepts (economic vs. cultural vs. system‑related meanings), empirical findings about variation in associations, or case studies that connect movements or attitudes (e.g., "MosaikLinke," Montagsmahnwachen, antisemitism) to left–right positioning. A document is non‑relevant if the words "links" or "rechts" appear only incidentally (hyperlinks, anatomical left/right, layout directions), occur in metadata or lists without substantive treatment, or if the piece focuses on unrelated measurement issues without applying them to left–right ideology. Ambiguous edge cases include studies of extremism or prejudice — these are relevant only when they explicitly link those phenomena to left/right self‑placement or use the left–right dimension as an analytical variable.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>A user searching "linksrechts" is likely looking for documentation and data on how German respondents interpret and place themselves on the left–right ideological scale ("links"/"rechts"), including the open-ended responses (F029/F030) and their coding in surveys like ALLBUS 2008, GIP and GLES. They want the question wording, variable names/coding and guidance on using these measures for analyses of political attitudes, party positioning and related electoral or candidate-level research.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "linksrechts" if it explicitly discusses left–right political orientation (e.g. the German term "Links–Rechts", "LinksRechtsSelbsteinstufung") or contains the survey items/variables measuring it (such as questions F029/F030 or LinksRechts self-placement and party/voter left–right ratings). Examples of clearly relevant documents are codebooks or datasets that record ALLBUS/GIP/GLES variables on left–right self-placement, question wording, response coding, or experiments that prime or vary left–right measures. Documents are not relevant if "links" and "rechts" appear only as ordinary directional words, hyperlinks, legal terms ("Rechtsanwalt"), or in unrelated topic lists (e.g. technical metadata, timestamps, or non-political modules). Edge cases include records that mention "LinksRechts" only in a long variable list without providing the actual items (partially relevant) and documents using English synonyms ("left–right", "left right scale") or experimental descriptions of how the left–right question was rotated or primed (which should be considered relevant).</narr>
</research_data>
<variables>
	<desc>Survey items asking respondents to place their own political views on a left–right scale (using lettered boxes or a 0–10 "thermometer") and to rate where various political parties fall on that same scale. It also asks respondents to assess how strong they perceive conflicts or interest differences to be between various social and political groups in Germany.</desc>
	<narr>Relevant documents are those that clearly function as a political questionnaire or survey instrument using the German left/right framing—e.g., items that ask respondents to place themselves on a left–right scale, to rate parties on that same scale, or to rate group conflicts (the text’s repeated “links” and “rechts,” scale descriptors like 0–10, answer boxes/letters, and mode labels like CAWI/MAIL are strong signals). Include full question wording, response options, and instructions (such as “make a cross” or “name the letter below”) because these show the document’s purpose and allow mapping to the query. Non-relevant documents mention “left” and “right” in other senses (driving directions, anatomical terms, or web “links”), are opinion pieces that only refer to left/right metaphorically, or are fragments that lack any survey structure or scale. Edge cases include transcripts or reports that quote the questionnaire (still relevant) and heavily duplicated or HTML-tagged copies (the repeated br tags or repeats are noisy but still relevant if the survey content is present).</narr>

	<desc>The user is looking for information about the "left–right" political orientation question (Links–Rechts-Skala) used in the PAWCER project pretests—how the question was worded and evaluated. They likely want details on how this item (tested via face-to-face cognitive interviews) performed alongside questions on income differences and redistribution for cross‑national comparisons of welfare, climate, and energy attitudes.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "linksrechts" if it explicitly discusses the left–right political orientation scale or contains survey items, coding, or results about left–right self-placement (e.g., the LinksRechtsSkala, questionnaire wording, translation issues, or cross-country comparisons of left–right positions). Materials describing pretests, cognitive interviews, or psychometric tests of left–right items—for example reports of face‑to‑face cognitive interviews used to refine a left–right question—are clearly relevant. Documents that focus on the PAWCER project’s topics (welfare, climate, energy) are only relevant when they also address measurement of political orientation; otherwise they are not. Watch for false positives such as texts using "links" and "rechts" as literal directions, file names, or unrelated code, or content that discusses redistribution attitudes without explicitly linking them to a left–right scale. Finally, language and tokenization edge cases matter: German variants (LinksRechtsSkala, links-rechts, linksrechts) and synonyms like “political ideology” or “left–right self-placement” should be treated as relevant matches.</narr>

<title>homeoffice</title>
<publication>
	<desc>Information on the prevalence, access, use and effects of home office (remote/mobile work) — including who can work from home, how much work is done and recognised there, impacts on productivity, wellbeing and gender/social inequalities, and organisational or spatial consequences. The query also seeks empirical findings from German surveys (e.g. BIBB‑BAuA, SOEP, ALLBUS, LPP/LLP, DEAS), changes driven by COVID‑19, and related legal and policy implications.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "homeoffice" when it explicitly treats working from home (homeoffice/telework/remote work) — for example by reporting prevalence rates, access and usage patterns, contractual recognition, sectoral or regional breakdowns, demographic differences (age, gender, class), effects on productivity, mental health or work–life balance, or legal and organizational regulations introduced during the pandemic. Highly relevant items include representative surveys that give percentages of employees who work from home, longitudinal comparisons (pre/post‑COVID), studies of homeoffice arrangements and equipment, and evaluations of policy or company rules that enable or restrict homeworking. Documents that focus only on general digitalization, industrial automation, or office employment without saying where the work is done are non‑relevant or only marginally relevant. Edge cases include research on coworking, mobile work or digital collaboration tools — these are partially relevant if they explicitly compare or situate those modes with homeoffice, and policy papers on childcare/lockdowns are relevant only if they measure homeoffice uptake or consequences. Finally, consider methodology and context: small qualitative case studies or single‑firm reports may be informative but less generalizable than large representative surveys, and region‑ or language‑specific statistics (e.g. German datasets) matter for scope.</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>Seeking research and survey-based information on home office/telework in Germany during the COVID‑19 pandemic — including how prevalence changed, which occupations and social groups could or did work from home (indices of feasibility), and associated economic, health (e.g., compulsive working), family and policy impacts. The user likely wants data sources, study findings, and measures/variables used in German surveys to analyze telework effects and distribution.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "homeoffice" if it treats telework/working from home as a central subject — for example empirical estimates of prevalence (e.g., Kohlrausch & Zucco 2020), indices measuring the ability to work from home, regression analyses of home office effects (e.g., on work addiction), or discussions of legal/policy attitudes toward a statutory right to home office. Relevant signals include explicit keywords and synonyms (homeoffice, Home Office, telework, Telearbeit, work from home), descriptions of survey modules that record current work location or changes in work situation, and analyses that compare occupational or social groups by home‑working ability. A document is non‑relevant when home office is only mentioned incidentally among many unrelated topics (e.g., a broad COVID survey that never records work location), or when it focuses on tangential items (general pandemic risk perception, tax policy, or EU politics) without linking them to remote working. Edge cases to watch: German‑language content or mixed multilingual texts are relevant if they contain the above signals; papers about digital tools or telecommunication infrastructure without worker/outcome data are partially relevant; and short, passing mentions of "working from home" (e.g., as one line in a long questionnaire) may be low relevance unless the dataset provides analyzable home‑office variables.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>Seeks information and viewpoints about the debate on whether employees should have a legal right to work from home when the job allows it. Also asks whether and how it would be feasible for the respondent’s specific role to perform part of their work remotely.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "homeoffice" when it directly discusses working from home — for example debates about a legal right to telework, employer policies, surveys asking whether jobs can be performed remotely, technical or occupational constraints, or case studies of hybrid work arrangements. Relevant examples include draft legislation on a statutory right to work from home, company telecommuting rules, employee questionnaires asking "Wäre es bei Ihrer Tätigkeit möglich, einen Teil der Arbeit von zuhause zu erledigen?", and analyses of which job tasks can or cannot be done remotely. Non-relevant documents mention "home office" only incidentally (e.g., ads for home office furniture, interior design posts), use the term in a different sense (the UK Home Office government department or a brand named HomeOffice), or discuss COVID-19 broadly without addressing entitlement, feasibility, or implementation. Edge cases include multilingual or poorly parsed texts where "br" or line breaks split survey questions, documents that only touch on remote work peripherally (partially relevant), and materials focused on technical infrastructure or occupational safety that are relevant only if they tie back to the question of allowing work from home.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>I want to know what questions about working from home were developed and tested in the 2024 BIBB–BAuA employee survey pretest and in the FReDA family-demographic panel pretests, and how those items were administered and evaluated. Specifically, I need details on the content of the home-office items and the testing methods used (telephone cognitive interviews for BIBB–BAuA and web probing online pretests for FReDA).</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "homeoffice" when it directly discusses working from home or telework — for example surveys, pretests or studies about frequency of homeworking, digital tools used, team collaboration, leadership in remote settings, or policies enabling homeoffice. Documents that test or report questionnaire items on "Arbeit im Homeoffice," measure conditions and prevalence, or evaluate related variables (childcare while teleworking, division of household labor) are clearly relevant. Borderline cases include texts that only mention "homeoffice" in a long list of topics or as an item in a questionnaire without substantive findings; these may be less useful but still potentially relevant depending on the search intent. Non-relevant documents are those using "home office" in a different sense (e.g., the UK Home Office government department), selling home-office furniture, or discussing domestic cybersecurity or interior design without any employment/telework context. Also treat synonyms (Telearbeit, remote work, work-from-home) and German-language sources as relevant, while excluding unrelated usages or purely administrative mentions.</narr>

<title>worklifebalance</title>
<publication>
	<desc>A search for "worklifebalance" seeks a concise overview of the concept, its common workplace and policy measures (e.g., flexible hours, telework, parental leave, childcare) and the evidence on their benefits and risks. It also aims to understand practical implementation challenges and gendered effects (career impacts, long‑hours culture, boundary‑setting) to guide employers, HR professionals and policymakers.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "worklifebalance" when its primary topic is the reconciliation of work and private life (often labelled WLB, work‑life balance, or Vereinbarkeit), or when it provides substantive discussion of measures, policies or practices such as flexible hours, part‑time work, teleworking/home‑office, childcare/eldercare provision, parental leave, managerial implementation, or empirical studies of the long‑hours culture. Practical case studies (e.g. in academia, corporate HR, public administration), evaluations of WLB programmes, cross‑country comparisons, gendered analyses (fathers, mothers intersectionality) and COVID‑era home‑office impacts are all clearly relevant examples. A document is non‑relevant if WLB is only mentioned in passing (e.g. a long bibliography or a glossary entry), if the focus is on an unrelated theme (e.g. pure diversity theory without any WLB measures), or if the term appears solely as a metaphor with no substantive treatment of work–private boundary issues. Edge cases to watch for: relevant material may be in other languages (German texts using WorkLifeBalance/WLB), use variant spellings/acronyms, or treat WLB critically (e.g. as self‑exploitation) — these are still relevant but may require attention to scope (policy vs. critique) and context (national labour law, sector, or methodology).</narr>
</publication>
<research_data>
	<desc>Seeking research-based guidance on how individuals, employers and policymakers can achieve work–life balance and an equitable division of paid and family work for both women and men. The user also wants empirical evidence—survey and panel data (including COVID‑19 impact studies) on workplace conditions, policies, and outcomes (income, employment, wellbeing) that enable or hinder partnership-based sharing of work and family responsibilities.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the keyword "worklifebalance" when it explicitly studies or measures the compatibility of work and family life (German: "Vereinbarkeit") or contains variables that operationalize that concept — for example, division of paid and unpaid work between partners, working hours (full/part‑time, overtime, shift work), childcare availability and costs, parental leave, telework/remote work, and measures of work–family conflict or satisfaction. In the supplied paragraph the study titled "Betriebliche Gelingensbedingungen einer partnerschaftlichen Aufteilung von Erwerbs‑ und Familienarbeit" (parents’ division of work), the pairfam panels, and the COVID‑19 everyday‑experience panel (school/kita closures, changes in work situation) are highly relevant because they directly address how work and family responsibilities interact. Documents that focus on unrelated themes (e.g. religion, nuclear energy, broad value surveys like some EVS/ISSP modules) or are purely metadata/methodological descriptions without variables on childcare, hours or role division would be non‑relevant or only background‑relevant. Edge cases: a text that merely mentions “work” or “family” without linking the two is only weakly relevant; cross‑national surveys (ISSP, EVS) can be useful if they include specific family/work items or time‑use modules but may be less useful if they only have general attitudes; likewise, studies limited to one gender, one age cohort, or that are outdated should be treated as partial evidence rather than fully generalizable.</narr>

<variables>
	<desc>The user wants to know which policy or workplace measures would be most effective in helping Europeans reconcile private and working lives—given that about 45% of the labour market are women. They are seeking a recommendation or ranking of options (e.g., flexible hours, parental leave, affordable childcare, telework) that best support work–life balance.</desc>
	<narr>A document is relevant to the query "worklifebalance" if it directly discusses measures that help people reconcile private and working lives in a European context — for example policies on parental leave, affordable childcare, flexible working hours, teleworking, care services, and gender-equal labour market measures — and backs claims with data or evaluations. Policy briefs, EU survey results, comparative country case studies, and program evaluations (e.g., showing how paid parental leave increased women's labour force participation from X% to Y%) are clear examples of relevant sources. Documents that are not relevant include those that only use the phrase superficially, discuss unrelated kinds of "balance" (financial balance sheets, fitness advice), or describe corporate perks without linking them to measurable reconciliation outcomes. Edge cases include pieces that cite the statistic in the paragraph (e.g., "45% of people in the labour market are women") but offer no policy analysis, outdated or non‑EU data that may not generalize, or materials focused on a single niche group (such as managers only) where conclusions won’t apply broadly.</narr>
</variables>
<instruments_tools>
	<desc>The user is looking for how "work–life balance" is measured in the ISSP survey—specifically the work–family conflict items (work interfering with family and family interfering with work), their wording and scale. They also want methodological details about the German pretest (face‑to‑face cognitive interviews) and the fact that the documented items are English translations of original German questions with a link to the 2015 source questionnaire.</desc>
	<narr>This document is relevant because it explicitly discusses ISSP survey questions on work-life balance, working hours, and a four-item work–family conflict scale (measuring work interference with family and family interference with work), and notes that items were pretested in German and translated to English. It is especially useful when it contains the actual item wordings, details of the cognitive (face-to-face) pretests, or notes on measurement and validity, which researchers can use as examples of instrument construction. It would be non-relevant if the file only contains administrative history (e.g., ISSP membership growth), formatting metadata (font, style tags), or a brief passing mention without any substantive questions or scale information. Edge cases include documents that use the concatenated token "worklifebalance" or only mention related terms (e.g., “working hours”) without the conflict scale — these may be partially relevant but could be missed by strict exact‑match searches — and translations that do not match the original German wording, which are useful for context but may not substitute for the source items.</narr>
